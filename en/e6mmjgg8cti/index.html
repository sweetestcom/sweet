<p>belching video</p>
<p>so i can see that i have this problem</p>
<p>because anytime i have hot or cold</p>
<p>liquids i am having serious belching</p>
<p>problems but in your video you mentioned</p>
<p>that roasted seeds and nuts</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re curved it&rsquo;s not good so</p>
<p>since you indicated that cooked food can</p>
<p>destroy the pancreas can you elaborate</p>
<p>on that please because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve been on your program since</p>
<p>may of last year i&rsquo;ve lost over 40</p>
<p>pounds so i&rsquo;m doing good lost five</p>
<p>inches in my uh liver area so i know</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>your program is working but this</p>
<p>belching and burping is just</p>
<p>i need to know why</p>
<p>exactly so a couple things if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking i&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>bile salts on an empty stomach or with</p>
<p>your meals um</p>
<p>and so we do know that the burping and</p>
<p>belching is related to the gallbladder</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s also something else and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure if you</p>
<p>saw my videos on the</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called tutka</p>
<p>okay have you if you haven&rsquo;t tried that</p>
<p>have you tried takka yet yes</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s good all right so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re doing the tutka which is a</p>
<p>different type of bile salt that keeps</p>
<p>the flow going and you&rsquo;re taking the</p>
<p>regular bile salts with meals and</p>
<p>everything is great and then you also</p>
<p>have the enzyme component so if you eat</p>
<p>just cook foods it&rsquo;s a strain on the</p>
<p>pancreas because the pancreas could run</p>
<p>out of</p>
<p>enzymes not to mention</p>
<p>average person being so insulin</p>
<p>resistant um</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s one part of the pancreas</p>
<p>which is the hormone but then</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>um a really damaged pancreas part where</p>
<p>the endocrine part is damaged and have a</p>
<p>really healthy enzyme part they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>kind of in the same boat so one affects</p>
<p>the other so um</p>
<p>a good experiment um</p>
<p>see what happens if you eat raw foods if</p>
<p>that makes things better than we know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the enzymes if it doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>things better then the area to look at</p>
<p>is either the amount of stomach acid</p>
<p>maybe you need more</p>
<p>stomach acid which is betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>probiotics because i did i do find that</p>
<p>you know if you really work on the</p>
<p>gallbladder and you&rsquo;re still getting</p>
<p>burping</p>
<p>it could also be a problem with um</p>
<p>fermentation which is going on because</p>
<p>you need more probiotics so it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to either be</p>
<p>fixing the stomach with more acid or the</p>
<p>digestive system</p>
<p>more probiotics i would look at both of</p>
<p>those areas</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know typically things are handled</p>
<p>with the bile salts but sometimes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not lucky to do that so we have to</p>
<p>go to different places but um i would</p>
<p>check both of those areas</p>
<p>now you said fermentation</p>
<p>i have been like my dandelion and kale</p>
<p>because they are harder to for me to</p>
<p>digest so i&rsquo;ve been fermenting them with</p>
<p>salt</p>
<p>like the night before and then putting</p>
<p>them in refrigerator</p>
<p>like parsley and and then i will eat</p>
<p>that so is that good because i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>just doing this for the last three weeks</p>
<p>now i think it&rsquo;s good i think um to</p>
<p>really get more fermentation it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be at least 72 hours</p>
<p>okay it does take a little bit more um</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>anything is better than nothing i think</p>
<p>more fermented foods is going to be</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something going on with some</p>
<p>imbalance that&rsquo;s creating this little</p>
<p>gas that&rsquo;s backing up in the system</p>
<p>which is creating the burping</p>
<p>so um i think you&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>um but it&rsquo;s going to be one of those</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>expand your creativity and try other</p>
<p>things so</p>
<p>will massaging the gallbladder</p>
<p>help for that</p>
<p>okay yes greatly you massage the</p>
<p>gallbladder and the opposite side the</p>
<p>pancreas</p>
<p>and and you&rsquo;re looking for areas of</p>
<p>tenderness and you may find that</p>
<p>you get more results massaging the</p>
<p>pancreas</p>
<p>i know this might sound totally bizarre</p>
<p>to people but i had a</p>
<p>diabetic i&rsquo;m talking like someone with</p>
<p>severe blood sugars</p>
<p>i just tried an experiment one time in</p>
<p>practice i did some massage on the</p>
<p>pancreas now you think well that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>but you know what</p>
<p>we measured her blood sugars coming down</p>
<p>dramatically within i&rsquo;d say maybe 15</p>
<p>minutes and there was no other</p>
<p>foods involved so</p>
<p>you can affect these organs uh in</p>
<p>different ways</p>
<p>so the pancreas is that massaging in the</p>
<p>center right below your um</p>
<p>your stomach area yeah it&rsquo;s down it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>centered but slightly to the left and</p>
<p>then go a little bit more to the left</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t cross over to the</p>
<p>center</p>
<p>and it goes primarily on the left side</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>thank you for your products that have</p>
<p>been very helpful too i&rsquo;ve been using</p>
<p>them so thank you for your program can&rsquo;t</p>

<p>question and doc i don&rsquo;t know if you can</p>
<p>see it today but there it is</p>
<p>yes i can see it okay so what is the</p>
<p>most important nutrient for the prostate</p>
<p>okay so out of all the nutrition</p>
<p>you can take</p>
<p>nutrient-wise</p>
<p>vitamins minerals things like that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the absolute hands-down most</p>
<p>important nutrient</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first question okay dig into</p>
<p>that folks and let&rsquo;s go over to see what</p>
<p>terry our</p>
<p>uh co-producer is up to and what he has</p>
<p>here is uh a great shout out now we&rsquo;ve</p>

<p>for watching and thanks everybody for</p>
<p>responding to the invitation by the way</p>
<p>to come on as virginia just uh</p>
<p>demonstrated to ask a question</p>
<p>personally so you can&rsquo;t get into his</p>
<p>office anymore but you can get into his</p>
<p>head right here on the dr berg show so</p>
<p>remember to look that up and and get</p>
<p>yourself um an application to come on</p>
<p>like the other folks okay let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>social media not to forget them he mang</p>
<p>from youtube in your previous videos you</p>
<p>recommended eating four eggs per day is</p>
<p>there any harm in eating more than four</p>
<p>eggs per day</p>
<p>no no</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not unless you have an egg</p>
<p>allergy um</p>
<p>eggs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different than meat it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most</p>
<p>bioavailable protein</p>
<p>um it produces the least amount of waste</p>
<p>in nitrogen as well as excess sugars</p>
<p>it has a it has pretty much every single</p>
<p>vitamin except vitamin c</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s a complete food and you</p>
<p>could literally live on eggs and</p>
<p>sometimes i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll have eggs um</p>
<p>multiple meals and</p>
<p>of course just make sure you do the</p>
<p>pasture raise organic eggs if you can</p>
<p>get that or have your own chickens like</p>
<p>i do i work right now i think we&rsquo;re our</p>
<p>chickens our hens are producing</p>
<p>i think 16 eggs a day i don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to do with these eggs</p>
<p>steve so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just egged out so we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>eggs in different forms different meals</p>
<p>so definitely it&rsquo;s more than four eggs</p>
<p>of that well i don&rsquo;t want to make this</p>
<p>suggestion when i was a kid i used to</p>
<p>throw eggs at cop cars so you know if</p>
<p>you got some extra ones along that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great fun probably better to eat them</p>
<p>though let&rsquo;s see myrna from facebook may</p>
<p>i follow the keto diet if i am prone to</p>
<p>kidney stones</p>
<p>yes you should but</p>
<p>um a couple things you need to know</p>
<p>about that number one you have to keep</p>
<p>your fluids a little higher like</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to lose a lot of</p>
<p>fluid on the ketogenic diet right so we</p>
<p>want to keep the fluids to at least like</p>
<p>two and a half liters of fluid a day and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll be good the other thing is</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>you know the most common type of kidney</p>
<p>stone is the oxalate version</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>making sure that your urine is acidic</p>
<p>would be a smart thing okay because</p>
<p>when you become too alkaline that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>you can start developing more stones but</p>
<p>if you have a uric acid stone you want</p>
<p>to do the opposite and you want to</p>
<p>alkalize the body</p>
<p>so check my videos on that because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little tweak but</p>
<p>and then one last point</p>
<p>make sure that you</p>
<p>avoid</p>
<p>spinach</p>
<p>almonds</p>
<p>chocolate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very high in oxlets</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a little tip</p>
<p>bummer if you like chocolate let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>youtube alice what could cause coffee</p>
<p>breath in someone who doesn&rsquo;t even drink</p>
<p>coffee now she didn&rsquo;t mention whether</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s on keto or whatever but what do</p>
<p>you think doc</p>
<p>gosh i have</p>
<p>i have no idea i have no idea for the</p>
<p>answer i you don&rsquo;t drink coffee you have</p>
<p>coffee breath so</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>stop kissing your husband i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>keep your distance well i&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>what who does have answers and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our audience for our first quiz question</p>
<p>hang on what the heck did that say dr</p>
<p>berg let me bring it up here for the</p>
<p>audience okay the question was what is</p>
<p>the most important nutrient for the good</p>
<p>old prostate</p>
<p>and 50</p>
<p>respondents said zinc 30 say lycopene</p>
<p>and 20 say saw palmetto any winners</p>
<p>today doc</p>
<p>yeah would you have some winners um the</p>
<p>most concentrated uh part of your body</p>
<p>that has zinc is your prostate and um</p>
<p>it has a hundred times more than the</p>
<p>blood so when you check your your zinc</p>
<p>and your blood</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so normal doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>mean what&rsquo;s going on in the other bodies</p>
<p>but zinc is so so important for the</p>
<p>prostate i will be releasing a video on</p>
<p>that for men because what happens i mean</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>as you age the the</p>
<p>zinc goes down for various reasons and</p>
<p>then the prostate starts to become</p>
<p>enlarged so it&rsquo;s very very important to</p>
<p>understand them a simple simple</p>
<p>nutrient that&rsquo;s deficient and</p>
<p>the food</p>
<p>that you can eat to keep it higher in</p>
<p>the diet diet which is going to be</p>
<p>either oysters or shellfish or red meat</p>
<p>which everyone&rsquo;s telling you to avoid</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>of this and that but when they do the</p>
<p>studies on red meat they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>differentiate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>processed meat and red meat and like</p>
<p>grass-fed the quality of</p>
<p>meat like beef they&rsquo;d lump it all into</p>
<p>one category they don&rsquo;t want to talk</p>
<p>about the quality because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know of any study that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>done on grass-fed</p>
<p>uh beef and how that affects the body in</p>
<p>any negative way because they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>done the study on that and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard to prove so the point is that um</p>
<p>the quality is is really important there</p>
<p>and also the people i&rsquo;ll guarantee this</p>
<p>if people that are eating</p>
<p>processed</p>
<p>meats</p>
<p>are also eating processed grains and</p>
<p>carbs so there&rsquo;s this whole push to get</p>
<p>people off red meat and onto</p>
<p>whole grains right</p>
<p>which no one&rsquo;s going to do whole grains</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to do refined grains with</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not healthy so anyway um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me started on that steve</p>
<p>this early in the morning mom&rsquo;s the word</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t talk about that we will talk</p>
<p>about chris from facebook uh who wants</p>
<p>to know if you should drink acv during a</p>
<p>48 to 72 hour fast whatever that is</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar i think you should</p>
<p>um yeah you could do it like 48 hours</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing it 72 hours</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going longer</p>
<p>realize you&rsquo;re going to be in some</p>
<p>pretty hardcore</p>
<p>ketosis and that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>an acidic state</p>
<p>so i i wouldn&rsquo;t i wouldn&rsquo;t add the apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re too acid because</p>
<p>you can become excessively acid i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s dangerous but i think uh</p>
<p>you might overdo it just like with with</p>
<p>me i am i was in a ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>then i</p>
<p>i started drinking kombucha tea which is</p>
<p>like drinking battery acid and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>acidic and i did too much and</p>
<p>when your ph becomes too far one way</p>
<p>especially acidic</p>
<p>you start noticing the heart pounding i</p>
<p>might i was trying to sleep in my ear</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a potassium deficiency</p>
<p>it was a um a problem with</p>
<p>acidity</p>
<p>acidosis</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>anyway i&rsquo;ve done some videos on that you</p>
<p>should</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good video to watch if you&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>acid or too alkaline the same thing with</p>
<p>people doing</p>
<p>too much baking soda right</p>
<p>you gotta know when it&rsquo;s too much is too</p>
<p>much and the symptoms that can occur</p>
<p>from that so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the answer okay so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that um when you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>elena from youtube what can help with</p>
<p>vascular calcification and</p>
<p>osteoarthritis</p>
<p>the most important vitamin is uh vitamin</p>
<p>k2 and i&rsquo;m assuming that you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>keto plan the healthy version of keto</p>
<p>and doing intermittent fasting because</p>
<p>all that oxidation and from the glucose</p>
<p>will create calcification but vitamin k2</p>
<p>is a very very important</p>
<p>nutrient to keep the calcium out of the</p>
<p>arteries</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole series of other things</p>
<p>you can do to start taking chelators and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i i would focus on k2 as the primary</p>
<p>thing and that will also help you with</p>
<p>arthritis and stiffness</p>
<p>that k2</p>
<p>that works with vitamin d3</p>
<p>okay terrific doc how about another</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>yep</p>
<p>all right so the best home remedy for</p>
<p>gout</p>
<p>fill attacks</p>
<p>the blank</p>
<p>i hope they have a good answer for that</p>
<p>because i understand that&rsquo;s no fun at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>but what is fun is the folks in our</p>
<p>green room and we have um lucy may a</p>
<p>lovely french-speaking</p>
<p>lady from quebec and let me unmute her</p>
<p>on my side make sure you&rsquo;re unmuted lucy</p>
<p>man you&rsquo;re wrong with dr byrd</p>
<p>thank you dr bird for all your amazing</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>and that i&rsquo;ve been watching in the last</p>
<p>few months</p>
<p>i am 64 and i am 15 pounds on the weight</p>
<p>i have an irritable colon and i have</p>
<p>advanced osteoporosis</p>
<p>i think i am becoming insulin resistance</p>
<p>i have difficulty to fully empty my</p>
<p>colon every morning</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t digest fat very well it makes me</p>
<p>sleepy</p>
<p>when i eat protein i have pain in my</p>
<p>toes and other parts the following</p>
<p>morning and i feel stiff</p>
<p>how can i gain weight and move to a t2</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>if i have difficulty with fat what will</p>
<p>be my first step so as you were talking</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just lining up what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and see if there&rsquo;s some type of common</p>
<p>denominator with all these things i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>always looking at links between</p>
<p>all this data you gave me</p>
<p>and so far what you</p>
<p>told me which makes the most sense is</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>to make bones strong of course you need</p>
<p>calcium and other minerals and but</p>
<p>in order to drive that calcium into the</p>
<p>bone</p>
<p>and absorb the calcium from your diet</p>
<p>you need vitamin you need fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>and fat cyber vitamins</p>
<p>need bile salts to absorb them</p>
<p>so i think you&rsquo;re missing bile because</p>
<p>you have constipation and one of the</p>
<p>symptoms of the lack of bile is</p>
<p>constipation so</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have enough bile because</p>
<p>the gallbladder is not producing it um</p>
<p>then you can&rsquo;t absorb vitamin k2 vitamin</p>
<p>d3 that helps you absorb the calcium and</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re left with this calcium</p>
<p>deficiency because of these other</p>
<p>transport vitamins that are missing so</p>
<p>um if you were to</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>i think people do need fat to actually</p>
<p>maintain their weight especially on the</p>
<p>keto plan so get on the keto plan</p>
<p>consume more fats but you need a good</p>
<p>amount of the bile salts i would rec of</p>
<p>course i&rsquo;m not biased of my own</p>
<p>gallbladder formula but</p>
<p>i am i would take that with the meals</p>
<p>and then i would like two or three with</p>
<p>the meal and then you&rsquo;ll start to</p>
<p>increase more</p>
<p>fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>now the bones will have a chance to</p>
<p>really start to</p>
<p>solidify and i will say it does take</p>
<p>time it could take</p>
<p>multiple years it could take up to six</p>
<p>years to get the bones back but</p>
<p>they need that constant</p>
<p>blend of all the minerals from the food</p>
<p>not just calcium and then you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>that the the bowels will start working</p>
<p>better because you have the lubrication</p>
<p>now from the bile and then with the</p>
<p>extra fat that will help you from losing</p>
<p>any more weight weight and then you</p>
<p>would want to add the exercise to</p>
<p>actually stimulate the bone health so</p>
<p>those are just a couple things i would</p>
<p>recommend that i think would help you um</p>
<p>with with everything</p>
<p>thank you and with the calcium um i</p>
<p>every time i try to take calcium i have</p>
<p>i have stiffness so i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>any calcium supplement is there one that</p>
<p>you will recommend because i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to take i think what i would do is</p>
<p>i would um get the don&rsquo;t get the calcium</p>
<p>carbonate</p>
<p>i think what&rsquo;s happening is you you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>because the bile is not there to be able</p>
<p>to transport it so that it ends up in</p>
<p>the joints</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>i would get a food based calcium</p>
<p>probably from algae but i would also get</p>
<p>a trace mineral i&rsquo;d probably use my</p>
<p>trace minerals too to help mobilize</p>
<p>allow the calcium work i&rsquo;ll give you a a</p>
<p>quick example like on the farm that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>living right now</p>
<p>uh calcium is the major driver of all</p>
<p>the nutrition in plants</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>if uh if you have too much calcium and</p>
<p>not the other not enough of other</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll create a toxicity in the</p>
<p>plant</p>
<p>and the calcium is not mobilized so you</p>
<p>need the whole package and i would not</p>
<p>um omit consuming some good</p>
<p>french dairy cheese</p>
<p>um if you can find some of that because</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the dairy has the good calcium that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>some uh that&rsquo;s easily absorbed and it</p>
<p>also has vitamin k2</p>
<p>what a coincidence</p>
<p>okay yeah i haven&rsquo;t touched jerry for 30</p>
<p>years um because i had the reaction to</p>
<p>it but maybe if i increase the bile salt</p>
<p>maybe i can try and see</p>
<p>try it and then make sure you go for a</p>
<p>quality like</p>
<p>like the real authentic uh swiss cheese</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re from a good farm</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re not swiss cheese but</p>
<p>french french cheese of course</p>
<p>exactly i had another question um</p>
<p>that nobody is able to answer um</p>
<p>by mistake i took a huge amount of</p>
<p>vitamin three and vitamin</p>
<p>k2 in a liquid form</p>
<p>in 24 hours i took one million seven</p>
<p>hundred thousand iu this happened four</p>
<p>weeks ago and i haven&rsquo;t touched the</p>
<p>bottle since</p>
<p>as i said i have advanced osteoporosis</p>
<p>so vitamin d d3 and k2 is very important</p>
<p>for me right now</p>
<p>so when do you think i should start</p>
<p>again taking vitamin d</p>
<p>and k2 or or separately</p>
<p>i think that one shot uh</p>
<p>dose is not going to be a big issue um i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s within a week it should be</p>
<p>calmed down a bit um</p>
<p>so i wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about that</p>
<p>so i think you&rsquo;re ready to start start</p>
<p>back into it</p>
<p>but the the the problem with toxicity</p>
<p>with vitamin d usually happens with</p>
<p>doses</p>
<p>very large doses like over a hundred</p>
<p>thousand or two or three hundred</p>
<p>thousand milligrams over a period of</p>
<p>months</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but of course you know you took a lot so</p>
<p>i think after a week i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be fine</p>
<p>okay okay because in the health food</p>
<p>store they said that the vitamin k2</p>
<p>is more dangerous to take it in huge</p>
<p>amount as i did and they were</p>
<p>recommending bio flavonoids and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been drinking your lemon your full lemon</p>
<p>with water every morning as you as you</p>
<p>suggest in one of your video</p>
<p>so um so okay so you think after one</p>
<p>month i&rsquo;m able to start again taking</p>
<p>both of them i think even after a week</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;ll be fine</p>
<p>okay okay okay well that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>answer thank you so much and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome</p>
<p>thank you that&rsquo;s great lucy mace thanks</p>
<p>so much and glad we were able to get you</p>
<p>to your both questions that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting it sounds like a lot of</p>
<p>vitamin d3 and k2 anyway uh give us a</p>
<p>call back and let us know how your</p>
<p>health progresses</p>
<p>in the future and let&rsquo;s see we do have</p>
<p>an answer doc to question number two for</p>
<p>the day which asks the best hormone</p>
<p>remedy for gout attacks is</p>
<p>the audience sixty percent of them say</p>
<p>tart cherries or tart cherry juice</p>
<p>twenty percent say apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>and 10 say</p>
<p>lemon juice and the final 10 say tumeric</p>
<p>are we on to something</p>
<p>no we&rsquo;re not onto something it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually the answer is baking soda oh</p>
<p>audience</p>
<p>yeah now</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why because um there is out of</p>
<p>all the medical conditions i would say</p>
<p>gout is the most mysterious because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>purines and how toxic purines is and</p>
<p>from different proteins and when it</p>
<p>breaks down the uric acid the uric acid</p>
<p>crystals go in there and start hurting</p>
<p>your big toe</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>a lot of people make the changes and</p>
<p>they still have the gout they</p>
<p>completely get rid of purine in a very</p>
<p>high percentage of them still have the</p>
<p>gout</p>
<p>and even people that take medication</p>
<p>they still have the gout so what is</p>
<p>behind this uh i did a very interesting</p>
<p>deep dive i will share that video this</p>
<p>next coming week but</p>
<p>but we do know one little thing one</p>
<p>little fact that is a</p>
<p>absolute positive</p>
<p>fact</p>
<p>if your ph</p>
<p>is too acid</p>
<p>the uric acid will leach out in an</p>
<p>affected joint if your ph</p>
<p>is slightly alkaline you won&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>this um this deposit forming</p>
<p>so if you were just to practice urine</p>
<p>alkalization therapy which i talked</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>with a little um baking soda maybe you</p>
<p>start with an eighth of a teaspoon some</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>um and drink that every hour for maybe</p>
<p>three hours</p>
<p>you will probably find your gout attack</p>
<p>go bye-bye because you just alkalize the</p>
<p>urine so um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna release the video on that you</p>
<p>can check it out</p>
<p>and um i think you&rsquo;ll find it very</p>
<p>interesting if you have gout because the</p>
<p>problem with gout is that</p>
<p>that one toe that can affect your gait</p>
<p>that can affect your knee your hip your</p>
<p>ability to exercise your ability to walk</p>
<p>and create a lot of</p>
<p>misery for people</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>but it can be</p>
<p>addressed</p>
<p>wonderful i hope so that&rsquo;s a terrible</p>
<p>disease farzana from facebook i have</p>
<p>hernia acid reflux and constipation i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing a low-carb diet doesn&rsquo;t say keto</p>
<p>or whatever and exercise regularly but</p>
<p>not seeing results please help me</p>
<p>well you mentioned three things so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just pick the i think protrusion</p>
<p>herniated disc i mean um i&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in your lower back um i&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>one thing</p>
<p>one of the best exercises that i brought</p>
<p>this guy in a couple weeks ago ben</p>
<p>patrick from knees over toes guy and you</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>walking backwards walking backwards</p>
<p>it is tremendous on your lower back to</p>
<p>strengthen the lower back even if you</p>
<p>have a disprotrusion because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>weight bearing and then if you start to</p>
<p>do the next exercise which is pulling</p>
<p>sleds</p>
<p>or a sled in your yard or something or</p>
<p>at the gym</p>
<p>boy is that such a great workout for</p>
<p>your back and knees and ankles</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m doing that right now and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling my back</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never felt better because i do a</p>
<p>lot of sitting</p>
<p>um i thought i had a protrusion i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but i it can still help with protrusions</p>
<p>especially in the rehab area</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then i also keeping that curve in</p>
<p>your lower back with the protrusion so</p>
<p>get some a foam roller like something</p>
<p>like this okay</p>
<p>and you put it in your lower back when</p>
<p>you sit to keep that curve</p>
<p>um in the right place and that</p>
<p>will greatly help sciatica and low back</p>
<p>pain</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s fantastic doc why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>kick off with another question and this</p>
<p>is one that should probably interest a</p>
<p>lot of folks</p>
<p>right why is splenda not</p>
<p>on the healthy keto</p>
<p>uh list</p>
<p>okay dig into that folks we expect a</p>
<p>answer because i&rsquo;m afraid the audience</p>
<p>was like 100 wrong last time and i know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely more capable than that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to give them another chance to</p>
<p>absolutely redeem yourself folks okay</p>
<p>jill from</p>
<p>facebook will the low carb</p>
<p>diet a keto diet excuse me cause a loss</p>
<p>of muscle tone</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>no i mean if you do it incorrectly yes</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re doing it with the right</p>
<p>nutrition okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about fasting let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>you know and you&rsquo;re eating every third</p>
<p>day can that affect your muscles well it</p>
<p>could if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not taking getting enough</p>
<p>amino acids over a period of time</p>
<p>but typically if you can maintain</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the biggest potent</p>
<p>stimulator of muscle growth</p>
<p>more than anything so if you have</p>
<p>sufficient amino acids and enough</p>
<p>exercise and all the other nutrients</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to lose muscle you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start losing muscle when you start</p>
<p>eating dirty keto and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>fasting incorrectly and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t exercise but think about this</p>
<p>how many people how many especially</p>
<p>women when they go through menopause</p>
<p>lose muscle it&rsquo;s a very very high</p>
<p>percentage because of the menopause and</p>
<p>the hormonal shift and so they need to</p>
<p>exercise even more once they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>menopausal</p>
<p>or else they tend to lose the muscles</p>
<p>and it looks just like fat</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>all the time it&rsquo;s atrophy or a</p>
<p>combination</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you start putting an exercise with the</p>
<p>right eating plan especially keto now</p>
<p>you can get that muscle back</p>
<p>interesting well i tell you this is</p>
<p>inspiring 85 year old chuck from youtube</p>
<p>um uh still trying to stay healthy he</p>
<p>says why do my varicose veins become</p>
<p>angry and soar when i fast uh they never</p>
<p>used to when i was younger well</p>
<p>i think i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing some nutrition and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a fat especially a</p>
<p>prolonged fast a lot of times people</p>
<p>take the b vitamins it take</p>
<p>the electrolytes</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>vitamin c</p>
<p>is another vitamin that doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>get stored that well in the body so</p>
<p>it could be that you have a subclinical</p>
<p>vitamin c deficiency which affects the</p>
<p>vascular part and so what you might want</p>
<p>to do while you&rsquo;re fasting is take a</p>
<p>whole lemon blend it with some</p>
<p>electrolytes to sweeten it up a little</p>
<p>bit and give you the potassium</p>
<p>drink that whole lemon juice down with</p>
<p>the glass of water</p>
<p>just the seeds and all the outside the</p>
<p>bar flavonoids just blend it for a good</p>
<p>45 seconds</p>
<p>drink it down and your vascular system i</p>
<p>think will do much better</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well you know we always</p>
<p>have all these great questions on social</p>
<p>media and of course from the green room</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t want to miss the fact that</p>
<p>so many people are so happy about uh you</p>
<p>know your remedies for various things</p>
<p>and games off i think that&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>non-diploma</p>
<p>uh says love you from dubai and</p>
<p>scattered throughout you know our many</p>
<p>great questions are all these people</p>
<p>that have acknowledged uh you know how</p>
<p>great uh the outcome has been by</p>
<p>following your recommendations i&rsquo;m one</p>
<p>of them i was porky and i&rsquo;m now 40</p>
<p>pounds lower i feel great i got more</p>
<p>energy i&rsquo;m really more of a intermittent</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>real</p>
<p>disciplined guy keto i work on but i</p>
<p>keep the cup of sugar or two out of my</p>
<p>diet every day so i&rsquo;m getting down there</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>any</p>
<p>any part of this that you do part it</p>
<p>pays results the more you do the better</p>
<p>you feel and all that and there is</p>
<p>absolute evidence of that with our</p>
<p>audience we don&rsquo;t have to spend anything</p>
<p>on the dr berg show</p>
<p>you know steve i just have to say one</p>
<p>thing about that it&rsquo;s just uh</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to give people the right</p>
<p>information the right knowledge and uh</p>
<p>um unfortunately there is some people</p>
<p>this might be hard to believe that</p>
<p>rely on information that is just from</p>
<p>the wrong source um like</p>
<p>some of the um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>governmental agencies that put out this</p>
<p>is the diet that everyone needs to do</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like that would be the worst place</p>
<p>to find out what to eat is from</p>
<p>that collective group which</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even find out what individuals</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>are telling you to eat these certain</p>
<p>things but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important if you&rsquo;re going to a</p>
<p>dentist make sure you go to a dentist</p>
<p>that has all their teeth if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go someone that is</p>
<p>marriage counseling make sure they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been married before so you have to have</p>
<p>people that have knowledge in that area</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the governmental recommendations like</p>
<p>the food pyramid might not give you</p>
<p>the best quality information i know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to believe</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>get the wrong source and you know when</p>
<p>people quote well</p>
<p>oh by this usca guideline i&rsquo;m like yeah</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the exact opposite thing you need</p>
<p>to follow i&rsquo;ll tell you right now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really important and then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say well you know</p>
<p>when like when i buy a product um or i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting half the information i want to</p>
<p>know does that person do is there a lot</p>
<p>of good reviews</p>
<p>are there actual people that had success</p>
<p>with it um despite that not being</p>
<p>scientific i think that&rsquo;s a good valid</p>
<p>way of</p>
<p>knowing if something is working or not i</p>
<p>mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to look at the person and see</p>
<p>if they look healthy or look at other</p>
<p>people that have gotten shared results</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>we have a lot of successors we have a</p>
<p>five thousand success stories on the</p>
<p>website which is not even a fraction of</p>
<p>all of them but at least that&rsquo;s a good i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a good indicator to know that</p>
<p>it might might work for you</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s very exciting</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see so the audience was excited</p>
<p>about the latest question which asked</p>
<p>why is splenda not on the healthy keto</p>
<p>list</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see 55 said splenda will spike</p>
<p>insulin 30 say it contains artificial</p>
<p>sugars like dextrose 10 say it spikes</p>
<p>sugar cravings and 5</p>
<p>say artificial chemicals can affect</p>
<p>brain function</p>
<p>so when you when you</p>
<p>every time you put anything in your</p>
<p>mouth um read the label okay so in</p>
<p>splenda the first ingredient is i think</p>
<p>dextro dex</p>
<p>dextrin and the next one is maltodextrin</p>
<p>okay so first of all dexterous i mean</p>
<p>splenda has the two</p>
<p>worst sugars on the planet which are</p>
<p>like very very high in the glycemic</p>
<p>index okay so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>so-called keto friendly</p>
<p>type of sugar because it&rsquo;s low sugar</p>
<p>well guess what maltodextrin and corn</p>
<p>syrup does not have to be listed as</p>
<p>sugars only total carbohydrates and</p>
<p>especially if the serving size is real</p>
<p>small if it&rsquo;s less than i think a half a</p>
<p>gram</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to list it so it&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>um wow this is like zero carbohydrates</p>
<p>zero sugars and you think you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine when it&rsquo;s really not fine and then</p>
<p>not to mention um it has sucralose in</p>
<p>there which is a</p>
<p>type of sugar that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>synthesized sugar that</p>
<p>involves adding a chlorine molecule</p>
<p>which has been</p>
<p>has a lot of side effects so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not on the it&rsquo;s on the keto</p>
<p>friendly list but it&rsquo;s not on the</p>
<p>healthy keto list this is a big</p>
<p>difference okay</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t know lose weight and die</p>
<p>young i think it&rsquo;s worth it for goodness</p>
<p>sakes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll look better</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see so stephen fry has been</p>
<p>popping in and out of our system and he</p>
<p>just came back and he doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>camera working so stephen if you can</p>
<p>hear us why don&rsquo;t you go ahead with your</p>
<p>question for dr byrd</p>
<p>sure thank you pleasure to be on um i</p>
<p>guess just try to summarize briefly uh</p>
<p>you know as of last year</p>
<p>excellent athlete condition</p>
<p>crazy intense workouts eat really</p>
<p>healthy well</p>
<p>in november i took methylprednisone for</p>
<p>a week and a half for my knees i started</p>
<p>training for long cycle rides</p>
<p>ever since then i&rsquo;ve been going downhill</p>
<p>cortisol is really high like 39 at you</p>
<p>know 8 a.m</p>
<p>i wake up at 2-3 a.m every night can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go back to sleep gaining weight on my</p>
<p>stomach losing weight and muscle on my</p>
<p>legs and arms</p>
<p>my muscles are so weak now they just</p>
<p>shake when i go to do anything strenuous</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a fundamental</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>lack of able to produce energy it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like hey i&rsquo;m tired it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um and so i&rsquo;m wondering you know</p>
<p>the doctor thinks i have a lot of</p>
<p>symptoms of bartonella because of my</p>
<p>tingling and weird things going on with</p>
<p>my feet</p>
<p>and wondering if keto or anything else</p>
<p>you would suggest might help because my</p>
<p>life has gone from athlete to basically</p>
<p>feeling disabled</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m sorry to hear that um i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do</p>
<p>but that the prednisone the synthetic</p>
<p>version of cortisol is is pretty wicked</p>
<p>on the body um if you haven&rsquo;t seen my</p>
<p>video on</p>
<p>the knee exercise i would look at that</p>
<p>to ultimately</p>
<p>show you an amazing exercise for the</p>
<p>knees which is basically doing a</p>
<p>backwards type workout but as far as</p>
<p>your body goes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>with with cortisol it might be</p>
<p>beneficial to get a</p>
<p>24-hour saliva cortisol test just to see</p>
<p>get a picture of what happens to your</p>
<p>cholesterol uh your cortisol right now</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you i did have</p>
<p>oh is it high or low</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely high in the morning</p>
<p>almost normal in the afternoon and then</p>
<p>high again in the evening</p>
<p>okay so we need to lower cortisol and um</p>
<p>a couple ways you can do it is um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a video i have out there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called if i&rsquo;m not mistaken it might be</p>
<p>hard to find but it&rsquo;s called the stress</p>
<p>webinar</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i basically walk you through</p>
<p>an acupressure technique that helps to</p>
<p>put your body in a really good</p>
<p>relaxed state</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mind that background and someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pounding on the door and i&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to get</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s get into a really relaxed state</p>
<p>where you can actually</p>
<p>turn off some of the</p>
<p>because see here&rsquo;s the thing here the</p>
<p>adrenals don&rsquo;t have an off switch</p>
<p>they only have an on switch they&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>sympathetic so</p>
<p>everything you have to do has to</p>
<p>stimulate the</p>
<p>opposite the parasympathetic the the</p>
<p>rest and digest so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to do a lot of</p>
<p>things to increase the stress like a</p>
<p>lemon balm tea is a really good thing</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;ve been taking that</p>
<p>oh good yeah it&rsquo;s almost like my body is</p>
<p>just locked and stuck in that mode and i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been and it&rsquo;s been six months</p>
<p>and i haven&rsquo;t been able to get it</p>
<p>unlocked and i&rsquo;ve tried meditation and</p>
<p>and the lemon balm and ashwagandha and i</p>
<p>just ordered your keto kit and i&rsquo;m hope</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to try that is that do you</p>
<p>think that would be something that would</p>
<p>be good for me you you absolutely need</p>
<p>to do the keto intermittent fasting</p>
<p>because that actually helps take someone</p>
<p>out of this this flat or fight mode</p>
<p>um do that with the manual</p>
<p>acupressure over the adrenal glands</p>
<p>themselves in that area</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done that before and</p>
<p>that will really help to help</p>
<p>physically because i don&rsquo;t think this is</p>
<p>a mental problem i think this is a</p>
<p>physical problem that you have to</p>
<p>manually um</p>
<p>do things to help relax your body</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in a state of</p>
<p>heightened cortisol when it shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>in a state of hypocortisol so um i think</p>
<p>the manual technique would be important</p>
<p>but i actually walk people through how</p>
<p>to do it with</p>
<p>this device as well as your own hands</p>
<p>so i would watch that video apply it i</p>
<p>think that probably would actually help</p>
<p>you more than anything i used to have</p>
<p>high cortisol that affect my sleep for</p>
<p>about 12 years and um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how i came up with it and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what helped me kind of get my body reset</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the right track do the keto</p>
<p>and that technique and then let us know</p>
<p>um in a few weeks how you do okay and</p>
<p>and the keto you that won&rsquo;t make me lose</p>
<p>more muscle mass you think that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll still be okay</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna make you lose more muscle</p>
<p>mass but</p>
<p>your real problem is just uh high</p>
<p>cortisol</p>
<p>not necessarily um anything else so</p>
<p>what what does keto do with high</p>
<p>cortisol it will help to reduce that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really what we want to do is</p>
<p>we want to take you out of this</p>
<p>stress mode that your body&rsquo;s stuck in</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to worsen your muscles</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll actually help your muscles because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get more</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get more um</p>
<p>balanced hormones you&rsquo;ll get more growth</p>
<p>hormone um</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll actually have less insulin</p>
<p>resistances too</p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s great steven best</p>
<p>of luck keep us posted on your progress</p>
<p>after that</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see uh here&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>amazing chris from youtube has lost 90</p>
<p>pounds in the last year with keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting congratulations but</p>
<p>uh often we hear that he has a lot of</p>
<p>loose skin i don&rsquo;t know if chris is a</p>
<p>male or female but anyway around my</p>
<p>thighs any thoughts on how i can get rid</p>
<p>of it</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>i you know what if you want to you want</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>get your legs in shape</p>
<p>and uh and the the tissue around it you</p>
<p>want to work your legs and i tell you</p>
<p>the the best thing is the pulling of the</p>
<p>sled pushing and pulling of the sled</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a um it&rsquo;s called the knees over</p>
<p>toes guy i did an interview with him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most amazing uh workout because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s non-weight-bearing it&rsquo;s pulling and</p>
<p>pushing so it&rsquo;s really good for the</p>
<p>knees and the ankles and the hips and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get some serious uh defined</p>
<p>muscles</p>
<p>not just in your legs but in the</p>
<p>buttocks</p>
<p>in your calves</p>
<p>and in your core it&rsquo;s a great workout um</p>
<p>watch that video that i did i think you</p>
<p>just do a search on dr berg and knees</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a recent video um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amazing you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll see some</p>
<p>great results that&rsquo;s terrific okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go with our next question</p>
<p>what is or let me let you read it doc</p>
<p>there you go</p>
<p>okay so what is the number one best food</p>
<p>for your brain</p>
<p>specifically cognitive function</p>
<p>concentration memory and focus</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s hope for my wife i hope we</p>
<p>get the answer to that and let&rsquo;s see why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we while the audience is digging</p>
<p>into that we&rsquo;ve got a nice guy tim from</p>
<p>portland oregon another one of these</p>
<p>multilingual guys that&rsquo;s so annoying you</p>
<p>know so emasculated to hear him chat and</p>
<p>all those different things but there you</p>
<p>go tim you&rsquo;re on with dr bird</p>
<p>hello dr bird hello</p>
<p>i really enjoy your videos and i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing uh now i&rsquo;m six months three weeks</p>
<p>in quito however i had an incident i i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to push my fasting beyond 18</p>
<p>hours 19 hours i can&rsquo;t get past 20</p>
<p>even after six months but i noticed when</p>
<p>i do a fast i notice immediate benefits</p>
<p>within three days my stomach is a little</p>
<p>bit smaller</p>
<p>you know all that good stuff however i</p>
<p>had a weird experience it was eight</p>
<p>hours or not nine hours after my fast</p>
<p>after i broke my fast i had this kind of</p>
<p>anxiety</p>
<p>is that because of the toxins i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>kicking out in my system do i need to</p>
<p>take some psyllium</p>
<p>uh for my uh small intestine to absorb</p>
<p>those toxins as they leave the liver</p>
<p>which is what i hear uh or is toxicity a</p>
<p>problem after fasting it&rsquo;s a way i can</p>
<p>get rid of those toxins without them get</p>
<p>coming back into my system</p>
<p>good question i don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>toxicity um</p>
<p>when you get when you go through the</p>
<p>fasting there is a</p>
<p>recycling of it&rsquo;s called autophagy where</p>
<p>your body is actually eating up uh</p>
<p>old proteins and discarding things but</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t necessarily feel toxic from</p>
<p>that um if you</p>
<p>a good thing to eat when you do eat is</p>
<p>the cruciferous foods and that would</p>
<p>naturally naturally</p>
<p>dismantle these poisons and do it in a</p>
<p>way that&rsquo;s very gentle</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the question when you say you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go longer than a certain amount of</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>what occurs</p>
<p>when you run up into those hours is it</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m so hungry i have to eat or what</p>
<p>is it</p>
<p>i feel generally woozy uh when i was a</p>
<p>kid i was hypoglycemic so i always had</p>
<p>to eat every three hours snack on</p>
<p>something and from hypoglycemia i became</p>
<p>hyperglycemic in my old age yeah i was</p>
<p>type 2 diabetic diagnosed in 2008. on</p>
<p>and on</p>
<p>uh so i have this</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>not to feel hungry so i no longer have</p>
<p>hunger</p>
<p>and so i can skip breakfast</p>
<p>and uh but i my real question and the</p>
<p>reason why i got called to ask this</p>
<p>question my real question is how often</p>
<p>should i fast a week and should i go up</p>
<p>the ladder so start at 18 hours for one</p>
<p>fast period wait 72 hours start another</p>
<p>fast go 20 hours or maybe 22. so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like my question i think i think</p>
<p>the most important thing is to keep a</p>
<p>consistent</p>
<p>uh pattern of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>through the week and really get that</p>
<p>down until you can do it for a period of</p>
<p>time because</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t do it sporadically because</p>
<p>that could be why you can&rsquo;t do it um</p>
<p>longer because you</p>
<p>we know you have a history of very bad</p>
<p>insulin resistance we know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hypoglycemic what is that that&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>problem with high insulin where does</p>
<p>that come from insulin resistance so um</p>
<p>the high insulin pushes the blood sugars</p>
<p>down too far</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;ve got this low blood sugar</p>
<p>situation which eventually then turns</p>
<p>into a pre-diabetes and a high</p>
<p>insulin so</p>
<p>we know that so the fasting is a way to</p>
<p>correct that and you want to do regular</p>
<p>intermittent fasting uh minimally 18</p>
<p>hours do that for your period over time</p>
<p>and then you graduate to um 20 hours so</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like that that should be your standard</p>
<p>like you have four hours between your</p>
<p>meal that would be great and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many other health benefits</p>
<p>that you can get if you do periodic</p>
<p>prolonged fast on a weekend you do 48</p>
<p>hours maybe every month you do 72 hours</p>
<p>but what will determine that is um</p>
<p>how well you get rid of this</p>
<p>intermittent uh this insulin resistance</p>
<p>so that takes some time so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>totally fight adaptive and that could</p>
<p>take three months but</p>
<p>well my blood excuse me my blood sugars</p>
<p>are good and i&rsquo;ve been testing i had to</p>
<p>meter all the time in the morning so my</p>
<p>blood sugar during the fasting effect of</p>
<p>the morning they never go past 150.</p>
<p>some people might say that&rsquo;s high but</p>
<p>they were really bad six months ago they</p>
<p>were up there about 2 35 like four in</p>
<p>the morning</p>
<p>so i finally as i lost the weight i was</p>
<p>managed to get my uh my blood sugar</p>
<p>levels down so during the day it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>110 to 120. so</p>
<p>what about when you wake up in a fasted</p>
<p>state what is your blood sugars</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re no heart this morning it</p>
<p>was 1 45 about four in the morning okay</p>
<p>so you</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you basically you need to get him down</p>
<p>to 80.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re running up against</p>
<p>because i i think what happens</p>
<p>your body now</p>
<p>is has</p>
<p>still has insulin resistance and so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>i mean where else is that sugar coming</p>
<p>from you&rsquo;re making it through the night</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a little high it</p>
<p>should be 80</p>
<p>so we need to get it down further so</p>
<p>just make sure that when you eat your</p>
<p>carbs are really low and i think that</p>
<p>will speed things up for you and then</p>
<p>make sure those are healthy ingredients</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>all right thank you</p>
<p>hey welcome</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great uh tim and tim used to</p>
<p>be in the businesses so to speak on the</p>
<p>air somehow and you can tell by his</p>
<p>great voice and all the equipment there</p>
<p>and he mutes himself out so anyway</p>
<p>thanks for making it so easy for us</p>
<p>today</p>
<p>tim and let&rsquo;s see tony from bulgaria are</p>
<p>you there i&rsquo;m going to get you on camera</p>
<p>hang on and make sure that you unmute</p>
<p>yourself</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s got a little bit of a spotty</p>
<p>connection but she&rsquo;s very lovely so we</p>
<p>want to get her on anyway there you go</p>
<p>tony you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>hello dr work i&rsquo;m such a fan of yours i</p>
<p>have your books</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve loved you for years i&rsquo;m so happy</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m here can you hear me well great</p>
<p>welcome</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>i have one question um let me address my</p>
<p>camera basically uh from a very small</p>
<p>child i cannot digest fat but and only i</p>
<p>also get the huge headaches after i ate</p>
<p>any fatty foods and i get very very</p>
<p>sleepy this has been from a very small</p>
<p>child all my life basically even if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nuts fish</p>
<p>oil for anything healthy whatever it is</p>
<p>i get huge headaches and i get very very</p>
<p>sleepy after any fatty food so can you</p>
<p>please give me one advice how to deal</p>
<p>with this condition</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>yeah um there&rsquo;s a nerve called the</p>
<p>phrenic nerve that goes on both sides</p>
<p>from your diaphragm all the way up into</p>
<p>your your neck which if that&rsquo;s activated</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to affect you give you a</p>
<p>headache and feel it make you feel very</p>
<p>uncomfortable and</p>
<p>what can do that is the digestive system</p>
<p>is not breaking down fats and then that</p>
<p>backs up and it creates pressure within</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>ducts in the tubes that are connected to</p>
<p>the gallbladder and the pancreas so i</p>
<p>think the best remedy of course is to</p>
<p>take some bile salts but not just bile</p>
<p>salts</p>
<p>i would get in addition to that i would</p>
<p>get tutka tutka is a very specialized</p>
<p>type of bile salt that</p>
<p>will keep the flow going</p>
<p>bile flow so there&rsquo;s no more sludge i</p>
<p>think you have bile sludge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of backing everything up you</p>
<p>take the tug it starts opening up this</p>
<p>these ducts and you may need um one two</p>
<p>three</p>
<p>on an empty stomach twice a day</p>
<p>to really create the effect and i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start feeling your headaches go</p>
<p>away because now you don&rsquo;t have no more</p>
<p>backup it&rsquo;s like a dam that backs up</p>
<p>from all the sludge</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i think that will produce the biggest</p>
<p>results for you and you&rsquo;ll finally get</p>
<p>relief from that as well as the the</p>
<p>manual therapy that i talk about is um</p>
<p>massage underneath your uh left and</p>
<p>right rib cage for the gallbladder and</p>
<p>the pancreas</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>tut cup um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a t-u-d-c-a</p>
<p>okay you can probably order it online in</p>
<p>your country and uh start taking an</p>
<p>empty stomach</p>
<p>try uh two twice a day and then if you</p>
<p>need three twice a day try that and</p>
<p>watch how your headaches go bye-bye</p>
<p>uh thank you and finally think uh</p>
<p>because of also when i get those fatty</p>
<p>foods i also get very very tired this is</p>
<p>also going to help me be less tired</p>
<p>after that</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;ll help your energy it&rsquo;ll help</p>
<p>the liver it&rsquo;ll help your digestion</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not able to assimilate</p>
<p>and extract nutrients from your foods so</p>
<p>you can imagine that</p>
<p>your cells are like uh i need energy and</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get energy so this will help</p>
<p>you get energy um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s more to talk about</p>
<p>this like b1 b1 is very important for</p>
<p>energy production i don&rsquo;t know if i just</p>
<p>would recommend following my healthy</p>
<p>version of keto to make sure you have</p>
<p>all the nutrients that you need</p>
<p>thanks thanks have a great day thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome bye</p>
<p>thank you so much uh tony what a great</p>
<p>representative of bulgaria she is and we</p>
<p>wish you all the best bulgaria they have</p>
<p>the good yogurt they have really good</p>
<p>yogurt and it&rsquo;s uh cultured and they</p>
<p>have the best um</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>i think you really have to go to</p>
<p>bulgaria to get the real bulgaria yogurt</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really it&rsquo;s hard to find in</p>
<p>america well uh bulgaria of course is</p>
<p>not in america so it&rsquo;s a great time to</p>
<p>talk about products that are available</p>
<p>internationally doc why don&rsquo;t you uh</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ll put a link down below if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in another country and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to get products um we have a</p>
<p>better way of getting them to you rather</p>
<p>than ordering them from the us which is</p>
<p>very expensive so</p>
<p>check the link down below hopefully it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>down there if not it&rsquo;s on our website</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific well the</p>
<p>audience is always so astute and quick</p>
<p>with these questions the latest one was</p>
<p>what is the excuse me what is the best</p>
<p>food for cognitive function</p>
<p>and the audience 80 percent of them</p>
<p>claim it&rsquo;s fatty fish 15 say egg yolks</p>
<p>and 5 say</p>
<p>avocados well i think we know who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching my videos and who&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>watching my videos because i released</p>
<p>that video this morning and that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>i mean if if you look at</p>
<p>all the nutrients that are so important</p>
<p>for the brain</p>
<p>you have omega-3 of course dha you have</p>
<p>vitamin b1 and you have zinc</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s many more but out of</p>
<p>all the foods</p>
<p>what food has the most of those specific</p>
<p>nutrients um it&rsquo;s salmon</p>
<p>salmon and wild caught salmon is has the</p>
<p>most of those nutrients now you can get</p>
<p>them in different foods</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>salmon is probably the best thing for</p>
<p>the brain out of all the foods and that</p>
<p>would be the answer and of course</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many other foods that you can</p>
<p>eat as well but um</p>
<p>but in this video it&rsquo;s interesting i</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>if you watch the one on my website on</p>
<p>youtube today that i released</p>
<p>i talk about the importance of vitamin</p>
<p>b1 and on the brain</p>
<p>wow fascinating information and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient</p>
<p>i mean you can go right into dementia so</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s important to keep that</p>
<p>cognitive function as high as possible</p>
<p>and as long as possible so</p>
<p>you become an older person with a good</p>
<p>mental with good mental capacity</p>
<p>okay well we do have another question</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m going to hold it back as we only</p>
<p>got five minutes and we need to pay and</p>
<p>loving attention to social media so let</p>
<p>me go back there uh ali from facebook my</p>
<p>mom has fibroids and has been doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>uh the three months but it&rsquo;s not helping</p>
<p>her can you please guide us</p>
<p>well fibroids are usually come from</p>
<p>the food so she&rsquo;s gonna have to</p>
<p>completely avoid all dairy</p>
<p>completely all dairy and also the</p>
<p>cruciferous foods are really good to</p>
<p>starve off</p>
<p>that tumor especially the blood supply</p>
<p>and so a lot of cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>would be really important not to mention</p>
<p>the anti-estrogenic effect</p>
<p>so i just want to make sure if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing keto</p>
<p>make sure you do that and make sure you</p>
<p>do it correctly</p>
<p>many times</p>
<p>when i find out</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s not getting results when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing keto they&rsquo;re doing some</p>
<p>other version of keto that&rsquo;s not the one</p>
<p>that i recommend the one i recommend is</p>
<p>the healthy version which</p>
<p>looks at the quality of foods as well</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>i mean just take a look at all these new</p>
<p>keto foods that are coming on the market</p>
<p>now and just read the in</p>
<p>read the</p>
<p>ingredients i mean it has</p>
<p>all sorts of hidden maltodextrin it has</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>labeled like tapioca starch or tapioca</p>
<p>fiber or soluble corn fiber which</p>
<p>actually is resistant maltodextrin which</p>
<p>is a a new thing in the market</p>
<p>they say that has no effect on your</p>
<p>blood sugars but um the problem is</p>
<p>a lot of companies are using that for</p>
<p>mouth feel and texture and</p>
<p>honestly um you&rsquo;re setting people up for</p>
<p>hidden factors that affect digestion</p>
<p>quality that don&rsquo;t give you any health</p>
<p>benefits</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re keto friendly</p>
<p>all right on social media it&rsquo;s now time</p>
<p>for what can i get away with when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fasting actually this doesn&rsquo;t sound too</p>
<p>wild connie on facebook wants to know</p>
<p>she can add a teaspoon of gelatin to my</p>
<p>coffee while fasting</p>
<p>absolutely but you realize that</p>
<p>the more protein powders you use or</p>
<p>proteins like gelatin</p>
<p>the less</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to stay in keto so it might</p>
<p>bump you up for a little bit of period</p>
<p>of time but</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking that small amount i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;d be fine</p>
<p>i i personally would use more of a fat</p>
<p>than a protein when you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>um like i would do like a</p>
<p>mct oil because when you start to use</p>
<p>either um</p>
<p>protein collagen or gelatin now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting in the protein and protein can</p>
<p>act</p>
<p>uh to stimulate insulin to a certain</p>
<p>degree not strong but a moderate effect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific and finally jay deere or</p>
<p>maybe not finally but let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>youtube jay dear from youtube what are</p>
<p>your thoughts on foods that contain</p>
<p>lectins</p>
<p>well i think that um it is a problem for</p>
<p>a certain percent of the population i i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>the majority of the population</p>
<p>so uh because</p>
<p>um i found that there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that are not reacting a majority don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>react but a certain percentage does so</p>
<p>um if you start to you&rsquo;re eating things</p>
<p>like tomatoes and other vegetables that</p>
<p>are high in lectin that</p>
<p>you know you still don&rsquo;t feel right or</p>
<p>you have arthritis well then you need to</p>
<p>get it checked</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re sensitive to lectins then</p>
<p>then you need to avoid those but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the majority so i don&rsquo;t really put a</p>
<p>lot of attention on it i talk about it</p>
<p>you also have people that are sensitive</p>
<p>to oxalates right it&rsquo;s not the majority</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then you have also some people that</p>
<p>are gut problems that are oh my gosh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just they have all sorts of</p>
<p>problems just with any vegetables well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the majority but</p>
<p>for those people that need it then great</p>
<p>but i want to make sure we get to</p>
<p>everyone steve in our green room i think</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t talk to debbie yet well we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t but she&rsquo;s got such a terrible</p>
<p>internet connection it&rsquo;s just so spotty</p>
<p>let me see if i can let me see if i can</p>
<p>hear from her dad</p>
<p>talk to us for a moment</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>oh good well we&rsquo;re not going to put your</p>
<p>picture up because it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>flip-flopping but go ahead and ask dr</p>
<p>berg your question</p>
<p>okay yeah go ahead dab so i&rsquo;m calling to</p>
<p>talk about men</p>
<p>menopause</p>
<p>if there is anything</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>connected to</p>
<p>stalling weight loss with the hormone</p>
<p>issues connected to menopause</p>
<p>yes uh when you go through menopause the</p>
<p>ovaries go in retirement then the</p>
<p>adrenal glands back up the ovaries and</p>
<p>the metabolism goes down because of a</p>
<p>higher amount of cortisol</p>
<p>so the question is how can you overcome</p>
<p>that unfortunately</p>
<p>it takes a lot more work</p>
<p>um than before menopause</p>
<p>um because you have atrophy and so your</p>
<p>program is going to be focused on</p>
<p>supporting your adrenals make and long</p>
<p>walks</p>
<p>and keep your carbs extra low</p>
<p>doing things to reduce stress</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>lemon balm tea is a really great natural</p>
<p>simple way that has really quick results</p>
<p>also taking b1 is another really</p>
<p>important thing to reduce stress</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>but unfortunately it&rsquo;s gonna you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to work twice as hard as</p>
<p>someone</p>
<p>else because you have these hormonal</p>
<p>factors now</p>
<p>affecting you so</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;ve done videos on this um</p>
<p>so go ahead and search out my videos i</p>
<p>have quite a few on menopause</p>
<p>and uh i can&rsquo;t uh because the time&rsquo;s</p>
<p>running i can&rsquo;t go too much into it but</p>
<p>uh i wanted to give you those quick tips</p>
<p>and for all those of you that are</p>
<p>watching i appreciate your attention</p>
<p>your wonderful comments</p>
<p>keep them coming i read up i read a lot</p>
<p>of comments and stay tuned for some real</p>
<p>interesting videos</p>
<p>that will be released on youtube</p>
<p>so have a great day</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
