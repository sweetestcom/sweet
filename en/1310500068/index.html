    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Christos Goudreau,</p>
<p>Vice President of Engineering at Google and Head of Search and Discovery at YouTube,</p>
<p>also known as the YouTube Algorithm.</p>
<p>YouTube has approximately 1.9 billion users,</p>
<p>and every day people watch over 1 billion hours of YouTube video.</p>
<p>It is the second most popular search engine behind Google itself.</p>
<p>For many people, it is not only a source of entertainment,</p>
<p>but also how we learn new ideas from math and physics videos to podcasts to debates, opinions,</p>
<p>ideas from out of the box thinkers and activists on some of the most tense,</p>
<p>challenging, and impactful topics in the world today.</p>
<p>YouTube and other content platforms receive criticism from both viewers and creators,</p>
<p>as they should, because the engineering task before them is hard, and they don&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>succeed, and the impact of their work is truly world changing.</p>
<p>To me, YouTube has been an incredible wellspring of knowledge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched hundreds, if not thousands, of lectures that changed the way I see</p>
<p>many fundamental ideas in math, science, engineering, and philosophy.</p>
<p>But it does put a mirror to ourselves, and keeps the responsibility of the steps we take</p>
<p>in each of our online educational journeys into the hands of each of us.</p>
<p>The YouTube algorithm has an important role in that journey of helping us find new,</p>
<p>exciting ideas to learn about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult and an exciting problem for an artificial intelligence system.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said in lectures and other forums, recommendation systems will be one of the</p>
<p>most impactful areas of AI in the 21st century, and YouTube is one of the biggest</p>
<p>recommendation systems in the world.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcast, follow on</p>
<p>Spotify, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter, at Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode, and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy,</p>
<p>sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say, $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and Member</p>
<p>SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App to support one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110 countries and have</p>
<p>a perfect rating and charity navigator, which means that donated money is used to maximum</p>
<p>effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, which again is an organization that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Christos Goudreau.</p>
<p>YouTube is the world&rsquo;s second most popular search engine, behind Google, of course.</p>
<p>We watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube videos a day, more than Netflix and Facebook</p>
<p>video combined.</p>
<p>YouTube creators upload over 500,000 hours of video every day.</p>
<p>Average lifespan of a human being, just for comparison, is about 700,000 hours.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s uploaded every single day is just enough for a human to watch in a lifetime.</p>
<p>So, let me ask an absurd philosophical question.</p>
<p>If from birth, when I was born, and there&rsquo;s many people born today with the internet,</p>
<p>I watched YouTube videos nonstop, do you think there are trajectories through YouTube video</p>
<p>space that can maximize my average happiness, or maybe education, or my growth as a human</p>
<p>being?</p>
<p>I think there are some great trajectories through YouTube videos, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend</p>
<p>that anyone spend all of their waking hours or all of their hours watching YouTube.</p>
<p>I mean, I think about the fact that YouTube has been really great for my kids, for instance.</p>
<p>My oldest daughter, she&rsquo;s been watching YouTube for several years.</p>
<p>She watches Tyler Oakley and the Vlogbrothers, and I know that it&rsquo;s had a very profound and</p>
<p>positive impact on her character.</p>
<p>And my younger daughter, she&rsquo;s a ballerina, and her teachers tell her that YouTube is</p>
<p>a huge advantage for her because she can practice a routine and watch professional dancers do</p>
<p>that same routine and stop it and back it up and rewind and all that stuff, right?</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s been really good for them.</p>
<p>And then even my son is a sophomore in college.</p>
<p>He got through his linear algebra class because of a channel called Three Blue, One Brown,</p>
<p>which helps you understand linear algebra, but in a way that would be very hard for anyone</p>
<p>to do on a whiteboard or a chalkboard.</p>
<p>And so, I think that those experiences, from my point of view, were very good.</p>
<p>And so, I can imagine really good trajectories through YouTube, yes.</p>
<p>Have you looked at, do you think of broadly about that trajectory over a period?</p>
<p>Because YouTube has grown up now.</p>
<p>So, over a period of years, you just kind of gave a few anecdotal examples, but I used</p>
<p>to watch certain shows on YouTube.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved on to other shows.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you want people to, from YouTube&rsquo;s perspective, to stay on YouTube, to grow as</p>
<p>human beings on YouTube.</p>
<p>So, you have to think not just what makes them engage today or this month, but what</p>
<p>makes them engage today or this month, but also for a period of years.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, if YouTube is going to continue to enrich people&rsquo;s lives, then it has to grow</p>
<p>with them, and people&rsquo;s interests change over time.</p>
<p>And so, I think we&rsquo;ve been working on this problem, and I&rsquo;ll just say it broadly as</p>
<p>like how to introduce diversity and introduce people who are watching one thing to something</p>
<p>else they might like.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on that problem all the eight years I&rsquo;ve been at YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard problem because, I mean, of course, it&rsquo;s trivial to introduce diversity</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Yeah, just add a random video.</p>
<p>I could just randomly select a video from the billions that we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely not to even be in your language.</p>
<p>So, the likelihood that you would watch it and develop a new interest is very, very low.</p>
<p>And so, what you want to do when you&rsquo;re trying to increase diversity is find something that</p>
<p>is not too similar to the things that you&rsquo;ve watched, but also something that you might</p>
<p>be likely to watch.</p>
<p>And that balance, finding that spot between those two things is quite challenging.</p>
<p>So, the diversity of content, diversity of ideas, it&rsquo;s a really difficult, it&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s almost impossible to define, right?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s different?</p>
<p>So, how do you think about that?</p>
<p>So, two examples is I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Three Blue One Brown, say, and then one diversity.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of a channel called Veritasium, which is a great science, physics, whatever</p>
<p>channel.</p>
<p>So, one version of diversity is showing me Derek&rsquo;s Veritasium channel, which I was really</p>
<p>excited to discover.</p>
<p>I actually now watch a lot of his videos.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re a person who&rsquo;s watching some math channels and you might be interested</p>
<p>in some other science or math channels.</p>
<p>So, like you mentioned, the first kind of diversity is just show you some things from</p>
<p>other channels that are related, but not just, you know, not all the Three Blue One Brown</p>
<p>channel, throw in a couple others.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s maybe the first kind of diversity that we started with many, many years ago.</p>
<p>Taking a bigger leap is about, I mean, the mechanisms we use for that is we basically</p>
<p>cluster videos and channels together, mostly videos.</p>
<p>We do almost everything at the video level.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;ll make some kind of a cluster via some embedding process and then measure</p>
<p>what is the likelihood that users who watch one cluster might also watch another cluster</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very distinct.</p>
<p>So, we may come to find that people who watch science videos also like jazz.</p>
<p>This is possible, right?</p>
<p>And so, because of that relationship that we&rsquo;ve identified through the embeddings and</p>
<p>then the measurement of the people who watch both, we might recommend a jazz video once</p>
<p>in a while.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s this cluster in the embedding space of jazz videos and science videos.</p>
<p>And so, you kind of try to look at aggregate statistics where if a lot of people that jump</p>
<p>from science cluster to the jazz cluster tend to remain as engaged or become more engaged,</p>
<p>then that means those two, they should hop back and forth and they&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a higher likelihood that a person who&rsquo;s watching science would like jazz than</p>
<p>the person watching science would like, I don&rsquo;t know, backyard railroads or something</p>
<p>else, right?</p>
<p>And so, we can try to measure these likelihoods and use that to make the best recommendation</p>
<p>we can.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll talk about the machine learning of that, but I have to linger on things that</p>
<p>neither you or anyone have an answer to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gray areas of truth, which is, for example, now I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going there,</p>
<p>but politics.</p>
<p>It happens so that certain people believe certain things and they&rsquo;re very certain about</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move outside the red versus blue politics of today&rsquo;s world, but there&rsquo;s different ideologies.</p>
<p>For example, in college, I read quite a lot of Ayn Rand I studied, and that&rsquo;s a particular</p>
<p>philosophical ideology I found interesting to explore.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, that was that kind of space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of moved on from that cluster intellectually, but it nevertheless is an interesting cluster.</p>
<p>I was born in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Socialism, communism is a certain kind of political ideology that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>to explore.</p>
<p>Again, objectively, there&rsquo;s a set of beliefs about how the economy should work and so on.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s hard to know what&rsquo;s true or not in terms of people within those communities</p>
<p>are often advocating that this is how we achieve utopia in this world, and they&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>certain about it.</p>
<p>So, how do you try to manage politics in this chaotic, divisive world?</p>
<p>Not positive or any kind of ideas in terms of filtering what people should watch next</p>
<p>and in terms of also not letting certain things be on YouTube.</p>
<p>This is an exceptionally difficult responsibility.</p>
<p>Well, the responsibility to get this right is our top priority.</p>
<p>And the first comes down to making sure that we have good, clear rules of the road, right?</p>
<p>Like, just because we have freedom of speech doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can literally say anything,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like, we as a society have accepted certain restrictions on our freedom of speech.</p>
<p>There are things like libel laws and things like that.</p>
<p>And so, where we can draw a clear line, we do, and that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>We draw a clear line, we do, and we continue to evolve that line over time.</p>
<p>However, as you pointed out, wherever you draw the line, there&rsquo;s going to be a border</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>And in that border line area, we are going to maybe not remove videos, but we will try</p>
<p>to reduce the recommendations of them or the proliferation of them by demoting them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in those situations, try to raise what we would call authoritative or</p>
<p>credible sources of information.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re not trying to, I mean, you mentioned Ayn Rand and communism.</p>
<p>Those are two valid points of view that people are going to debate and discuss.</p>
<p>And of course, people who believe in one or the other of those things are going to try</p>
<p>to persuade other people to their point of view.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;re not trying to settle that or choose a side or anything like that.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to do is make sure that the people who are expressing those point</p>
<p>of view and offering those positions are authoritative and credible.</p>
<p>So, let me ask a question about people I don&rsquo;t like personally.</p>
<p>You heard me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you leave comments on this.</p>
<p>But sometimes, they&rsquo;re brilliantly funny, which is trolls.</p>
<p>So, people who kind of mock, I mean, the internet is full, Reddit of mock style</p>
<p>comedy where people just kind of make fun of, point out that the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s brilliant comedy in that, but sometimes it can get cruel and mean.</p>
<p>So, on that, on the mean point, and sorry to look at the comments, but I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>and sorry to linger on these things that have no good answers.</p>
<p>But actually, I totally hear you that this is really important that you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>solve it.</p>
<p>But how do you reduce the meanness of people on YouTube?</p>
<p>I understand that anyone who uploads YouTube videos has to become resilient to a certain</p>
<p>amount of meanness.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve heard that from many creators.</p>
<p>And we are trying in various ways, comment ranking, allowing certain features to block</p>
<p>people, to reduce or make that meanness or that trolling behavior less effective on YouTube.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, it&rsquo;s very important, but it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re going to keep having</p>
<p>to work on and as we improve it, like maybe we&rsquo;ll get to a point where people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to suffer this sort of meanness when they upload YouTube videos.</p>
<p>I hope we do, but it just does seem to be something that you have to be able to deal</p>
<p>with as a YouTube creator nowadays.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope that, so you mentioned two things that I kind of agree with.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a machine learning approach of ranking comments based on whatever, based</p>
<p>on how much they contribute to the healthy conversation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>Then the other is almost an interface question of how do you, how does the creator filter?</p>
<p>So block or how does, how do humans themselves, the users of YouTube manage their own conversation?</p>
<p>Do you have hope that these two tools will create a better society without limiting freedom</p>
<p>of speech too much, without sort of attacking, even like saying that people, what do you</p>
<p>mean limiting, sort of curating speech?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that that overall is our whole project here at YouTube.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like we fundamentally believe and I personally believe very much that YouTube can be great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great for my kids.</p>
<p>I think it can be great for society.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s absolutely critical that we get this responsibility part right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s our top priority.</p>
<p>Susan Wojcicki, who&rsquo;s the CEO of YouTube, she says something that I personally find</p>
<p>very inspiring, which is that we want to do our jobs today in a manner so that people</p>
<p>20 and 30 years from now will look back and say, YouTube, they really figured this out.</p>
<p>They really found a way to strike the right balance between the openness and the value</p>
<p>that the openness has and also making sure that we are meeting our responsibility to</p>
<p>users in society.</p>
<p>So the burden on YouTube actually is quite incredible.</p>
<p>And the one thing that people don&rsquo;t give enough credit to the seriousness and the magnitude</p>
<p>of the problem, I think.</p>
<p>So I personally hope that you do solve it because a lot is in your hand, a lot is riding</p>
<p>on your success or failure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s besides, of course, running a successful company, you&rsquo;re also curating the content</p>
<p>of the internet and the conversation on the internet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a powerful thing.</p>
<p>So one thing that people wonder about is how much of it can be solved with pure machine</p>
<p>learning.</p>
<p>So looking at the data, studying the data and creating algorithms that curate the comments,</p>
<p>curate the content, and how much of it needs human intervention, meaning people here at</p>
<p>YouTube in a room sitting and thinking about what is the nature of truth, what are the</p>
<p>ideals that we should be promoting, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So algorithm versus human input, what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>I mean, my own experience has demonstrated that you need both of those things.</p>
<p>Algorithms, I mean, you&rsquo;re familiar with machine learning algorithms and the thing</p>
<p>they need most is data and the data is generated by humans.</p>
<p>And so, for instance, when we&rsquo;re building a system to try to figure out which are the</p>
<p>videos that are misinformation or borderline policy violations, well, the first thing we</p>
<p>need to do is get human beings to make decisions about which of those videos are in which category.</p>
<p>And then we use that data and basically take that information that&rsquo;s determined and governed</p>
<p>by humans and extrapolate it or apply it to the entire set of billions of YouTube videos.</p>
<p>And we couldn&rsquo;t get to all the videos on YouTube well without the humans, and we couldn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>the humans to get to all the videos of YouTube.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no world in which you have only one or the other of these things.</p>
<p>And just as you said, a lot of it comes down to people at YouTube spending a lot of time</p>
<p>trying to figure out what are the right policies, what are the outcomes based on those policies,</p>
<p>are they the kinds of things we want to see?</p>
<p>And then once we kind of get an agreement or build some consensus around what the policies</p>
<p>are, well, then we&rsquo;ve got to find a way to implement those policies across all of YouTube.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where both the human beings, we call them evaluators or reviewers, come into</p>
<p>play to help us with that.</p>
<p>And then once we get a lot of training data from them, then we apply the machine learning</p>
<p>techniques to take it even further.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense that these human beings have a bias in some kind of direction?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>We do sort of in autonomous vehicles and computer vision in general, a lot of annotation, and</p>
<p>we rarely ask what bias do the annotators have.</p>
<p>Even in the sense that they&rsquo;re better at annotating certain things than others.</p>
<p>For example, people are much better at, for example, at writing, they&rsquo;re much better at</p>
<p>or much better at annotating segmentation at segmenting cars in a scene versus segmenting</p>
<p>bushes or trees.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s specific mechanical reasons for that, but also because it&rsquo;s semantic gray area.</p>
<p>And just for a lot of reasons, people are just terrible at annotating trees.</p>
<p>Okay, so in the same kind of sense, do you think of, in terms of people reviewing videos</p>
<p>or annotating the content of videos, is there some kind of bias that you&rsquo;re aware of or</p>
<p>seek out in that human input?</p>
<p>Well, we take steps to try to overcome these kinds of biases or biases that we think would</p>
<p>be problematic.</p>
<p>So for instance, like we ask people to have a bias towards scientific consensus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that we instruct them to do.</p>
<p>We ask them to have a bias towards demonstration of expertise or credibility or authoritativeness.</p>
<p>But there are other biases that we want to make sure to try to remove.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many techniques for doing this.</p>
<p>One of them is you send the same thing to be reviewed to many people.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s one technique.</p>
<p>Another is that you make sure that the people that are doing these sorts of tasks, that</p>
<p>these sorts of tasks are from different backgrounds and different areas of the United States or</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>But then, even with all of that, it&rsquo;s possible for certain kinds of what we would call unfair</p>
<p>biases to creep into machine learning systems, primarily, as you said, because maybe the</p>
<p>training data itself comes in in a biased way.</p>
<p>So, we also have worked very hard on improving the machine learning systems to remove and</p>
<p>reduce unfair biases when it goes against or involves some protected class, for instance.</p>
<p>Thank you for exploring with me some of the more challenging things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a few more that we&rsquo;ll jump back to.</p>
<p>But let me jump into the fun part, which is maybe the basics of the quote, unquote, YouTube</p>
<p>algorithm.</p>
<p>What does the YouTube algorithm look at to make recommendation for what to watch next?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s from a machine learning perspective.</p>
<p>Or when you search for a particular term, how does it know what to show you next?</p>
<p>Because it seems to, at least for me, do an incredible job of both.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s kind of you to say.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t used to do a very good job, but it&rsquo;s gotten better over the years.</p>
<p>Even I observed that it&rsquo;s improved quite a bit.</p>
<p>Those are two different situations.</p>
<p>Like when you search for something, YouTube uses the best technology we can get from Google</p>
<p>to make sure that the YouTube search system finds what someone&rsquo;s looking for.</p>
<p>And of course, the very first things that one thinks about is, okay, well, does the</p>
<p>word occur in the title, for instance?</p>
<p>But there are much more sophisticated things where we&rsquo;re mostly trying to do some syntactic</p>
<p>match or maybe a semantic match based on words that we can add to the document itself.</p>
<p>For instance, maybe is this video watched a lot after this query?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that we can observe and then as a result, make sure that that document</p>
<p>would be retrieved for that query.</p>
<p>Now, when you talk about what kind of videos would be recommended to watch next, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something, again, we&rsquo;ve been working on for many years and probably the first real attempt</p>
<p>to do that well was to use collaborative filtering.</p>
<p>Can you describe what collaborative filtering is?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basically what we do is we observe which videos get watched close together by</p>
<p>the same person.</p>
<p>And if you observe that and if you can imagine creating a graph where the videos that get</p>
<p>watched close together by the most people are very close to one another in this graph</p>
<p>and videos that don&rsquo;t frequently get watched close together by the same person or the same</p>
<p>people are far apart, then you end up with this graph that we call the related graph</p>
<p>that basically represents videos that are very similar or related in some way.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s amazing about that is that it puts all the videos that are in the same</p>
<p>language together, for instance, and we didn&rsquo;t even have to think about language.</p>
<p>It just does it, right?</p>
<p>And it puts all the videos that are about sports together and it puts most of the music</p>
<p>videos together and it puts all of these sorts of videos together just because that&rsquo;s sort</p>
<p>of the way the people using YouTube behave.</p>
<p>So that already cleans up a lot of the problem.</p>
<p>It takes care of the lowest hanging fruit, which happens to be a huge one of just managing</p>
<p>these millions of videos.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago I was talking to someone who was trying to propose that we</p>
<p>do a research project concerning people who are bilingual, and this person was making</p>
<p>this proposal based on the idea that YouTube could not possibly be good at recommending</p>
<p>videos well to people who are bilingual.</p>
<p>And so she was telling me about this and I said, well, can you give me an example of</p>
<p>what problem do you think we have on YouTube with the recommendations?</p>
<p>And so she said, well, I&rsquo;m a researcher in the US and when I&rsquo;m looking for academic</p>
<p>topics, I want to see them in English.</p>
<p>And so she searched for one, found a video, and then looked at the watch next suggestions</p>
<p>and they were all in English.</p>
<p>And so she said, oh, I see.</p>
<p>YouTube must think that I speak only English.</p>
<p>And so she said, now I&rsquo;m actually originally from Turkey and sometimes when I&rsquo;m cooking,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I want to make some baklava, I really like to watch videos that are in Turkish.</p>
<p>And so she searched for a video about making the baklava and then selected it and it was</p>
<p>in Turkish and the watch next recommendations were in Turkish.</p>
<p>And she just couldn&rsquo;t believe how this was possible and how is it that you know that</p>
<p>I speak both these two languages and put all the videos together?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just as a sort of an outcome of this related graph that&rsquo;s created through</p>
<p>collaborative filtering.</p>
<p>So for me, one of my huge interests is just human psychology, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s such a powerful platform on which to utilize human psychology to discover what</p>
<p>people, individual people want to watch next.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also be just fascinating to me.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve, Google search has ability to look at your own history and I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>that before, just, just what I&rsquo;ve searched three years for many, many years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating picture of who I am actually.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s ever summarized.</p>
<p>I personally would love that.</p>
<p>A summary of who I am as a person on the internet to me, because I didn&rsquo;t get a reply</p>
<p>of who I am as a person on the internet to me, because I think it reveals, I think it</p>
<p>puts a mirror to me or to others.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s actually quite revealing and interesting, you know, just the, maybe</p>
<p>in the number of, it&rsquo;s a joke, but not really is the number of cat videos I&rsquo;ve watched or</p>
<p>videos of people falling, you know, stuff that&rsquo;s absurd, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And of course it&rsquo;s really good for the machine learning aspect to, to show, to figure out</p>
<p>what to show next.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Have you just as a tangent played around with the idea of giving a map to people sort of,</p>
<p>as opposed to just using this information to show what&rsquo;s next, showing them here are</p>
<p>the clusters you&rsquo;ve loved over the years kind of thing?</p>
<p>Well, we do provide the history of all the videos that you&rsquo;ve watched.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you can definitely search through that and look through it and search through it</p>
<p>to see what it is that you&rsquo;ve been watching on YouTube.</p>
<p>We have actually in various times experimented with this sort of cluster idea, finding ways</p>
<p>to demonstrate or show people what topics they&rsquo;ve been interested in or what clusters</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve watched from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that you bring this up because in some sense, the way the recommendation</p>
<p>system of YouTube sees a user is exactly as the history of all the videos they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched on YouTube.</p>
<p>And so you can think of yourself or any user on YouTube as kind of like a DNA strand of</p>
<p>all your videos, right?</p>
<p>That sort of represents you, you can also think of it as maybe a vector in the space</p>
<p>of all the videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>And so now once you think of it as a vector in the space of all the videos on YouTube,</p>
<p>then you can start to say, okay, well, which other vectors are close to me and to my vector?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the ways that we generate some diverse recommendations is because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, okay, well, these people seem to be close with respect to the videos they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched on YouTube, but here&rsquo;s a topic or a video that one of them has watched and</p>
<p>enjoyed, but the other one hasn&rsquo;t, that could be an opportunity to make a good recommendation.</p>
<p>I got to tell you, I mean, I know I&rsquo;m going to ask for things that are impossible, but</p>
<p>I would love to cluster than human beings.</p>
<p>I would love to know who has similar trajectories as me, because you probably would want to</p>
<p>hang out, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a social aspect there, like actually finding some of the most fascinating people</p>
<p>I find on YouTube, but have like no followers and I start following them and they create</p>
<p>incredible content and on that topic, I just love to ask, there&rsquo;s some videos that just</p>
<p>blow my mind in terms of quality and depth and just in every regard are amazing videos</p>
<p>and they have like 57 views, okay?</p>
<p>How do you get videos of quality to be seen by many eyes?</p>
<p>So the measure of quality, is it just something, yeah, how do you know that something is good?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think it depends initially on what sort of video we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So in the realm of, let&rsquo;s say you mentioned politics and news, in that realm, you know,</p>
<p>quality news or quality journalism relies on having a journalism department, right?</p>
<p>Like you have to have actual journalists and fact checkers and people like that and so</p>
<p>in that situation and in others, maybe science or in medicine, quality has a lot to do with</p>
<p>the authoritativeness and the credibility and the expertise of the people who make the</p>
<p>video.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about the other end of the spectrum, you know, what is the highest quality</p>
<p>prank video or what is the highest quality Minecraft video, right?</p>
<p>That might be the one that people enjoy watching the most and watch to the end or it might</p>
<p>be the one that when we ask people the next day after they watched it, were they satisfied</p>
<p>with it?</p>
<p>And so we in, especially in the realm of entertainment, have been trying to get at better and better</p>
<p>measures of quality or satisfaction or enrichment since I came to YouTube.</p>
<p>And we started with, well, you know, the first approximation is the one that gets more views.</p>
<p>But you know, we both know that things can get a lot of views and not really be that</p>
<p>high quality, especially if people are clicking on something and then immediately realizing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not that great and abandoning it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we moved from views to thinking about the amount of time people spend watching</p>
<p>it with the premise that like, you know, in some sense, the time that someone spends watching</p>
<p>a video is related to the value that they get from that video.</p>
<p>It may not be perfectly related, but it has something to say about how much value they</p>
<p>get.</p>
<p>But even that&rsquo;s not good enough, right?</p>
<p>Because I myself have spent time clicking through channels on television late at night</p>
<p>and ended up watching Under Siege 2 for some reason I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And if you were to ask me the next day, are you glad that you watched that show on TV</p>
<p>last night?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, yeah, I wish I would have gone to bed or read a book or almost anything else,</p>
<p>really.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why some people got the idea a few years ago to try to survey users afterwards.</p>
<p>And so we get feedback data from those surveys and then use that in the machine learning</p>
<p>system to try to not just predict what you&rsquo;re going to click on right now, what you might</p>
<p>watch for a while, but what when we ask you tomorrow, you&rsquo;ll give four or five stars to.</p>
<p>So just to summarize, what are the signals from a machine learning perspective that a</p>
<p>user can provide?</p>
<p>So you mentioned just clicking on the video views, the time watched, maybe the relative</p>
<p>time watched, the clicking like and dislike on the video, maybe commenting on the video.</p>
<p>All of those things.</p>
<p>And then the one I wasn&rsquo;t actually quite aware of, even though I might have engaged in it</p>
<p>is a survey afterwards, which is a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>Is there other signals?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s already a really rich space of signals to learn from.</p>
<p>Is there something else?</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned commenting, also sharing the video.</p>
<p>If you think it&rsquo;s worthy to be shared with someone else you know.</p>
<p>Within YouTube or outside of YouTube as well?</p>
<p>Either.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, you mentioned like, dislike.</p>
<p>Like and dislike.</p>
<p>How important is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important, right?</p>
<p>We want, it&rsquo;s predictive of satisfaction.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not perfectly predictive.</p>
<p>Subscribe.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the channel of the person who made the video, then that also is a piece</p>
<p>of information and it signals satisfaction.</p>
<p>Although over the years, we&rsquo;ve learned that people have a wide range of attitudes about</p>
<p>what it means to subscribe.</p>
<p>We would ask some users who didn&rsquo;t subscribe very much, but they watched a lot from a few</p>
<p>channels.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d say, well, why didn&rsquo;t you subscribe?</p>
<p>And they would say, well, I can&rsquo;t afford to pay for anything.</p>
<p>We tried to let them understand like, actually it doesn&rsquo;t cost anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>It just helps us know that you are very interested in this creator.</p>
<p>But then we&rsquo;ve asked other people who subscribe to many things and don&rsquo;t really watch any</p>
<p>of the videos from those channels.</p>
<p>And we say, well, why did you subscribe to this if you weren&rsquo;t really interested in any</p>
<p>more videos from that channel?</p>
<p>And they might tell us, well, I just, you know, I thought the person did a great job</p>
<p>and I just want to kind of give them a high five.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I sit.</p>
<p>I go to channels where I just, this person is amazing.</p>
<p>I like this person.</p>
<p>But then I like this person and I really want to support them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I click subscribe.</p>
<p>Even though I mean never actually want to click on their videos when they&rsquo;re releasing</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I just love what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s maybe outside of my interest area and so on, which is probably the wrong way</p>
<p>to use the subscribe button.</p>
<p>But I just want to say congrats.</p>
<p>This is great work.</p>
<p>Well, so you have to deal with all the space of people that see the subscribe button is</p>
<p>totally different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we can&rsquo;t just close our eyes and say, sorry, you&rsquo;re using it wrong.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re not going to pay attention to what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>We need to embrace all the ways in which all the different people in the world use the</p>
<p>subscribe button or the like and the dislike button.</p>
<p>So in terms of signals of machine learning, using for the search and for the recommendation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned title.</p>
<p>So like metadata, like text data that people provide description and title and maybe keywords.</p>
<p>Maybe you can speak to the value of those things in search and also this incredible</p>
<p>fascinating area of the content itself.</p>
<p>So the video content itself, trying to understand what&rsquo;s happening in the video.</p>
<p>So YouTube released a data set that, you know, in the machine learning computer vision world,</p>
<p>this is just an exciting space.</p>
<p>How much is that currently?</p>
<p>How much are you playing with that currently?</p>
<p>How much is your hope for the future of being able to analyze the content of the video itself?</p>
<p>Well, we have been working on that also since I came to YouTube.</p>
<p>Analyzing the content.</p>
<p>Analyzing the content of the video, right?</p>
<p>And what I can tell you is that our ability to do it well is still somewhat crude.</p>
<p>We can tell if it&rsquo;s a music video, we can tell if it&rsquo;s a sports video, we can probably</p>
<p>tell you that people are playing soccer.</p>
<p>We probably can&rsquo;t tell whether it&rsquo;s Manchester United or my daughter&rsquo;s soccer team.</p>
<p>So these things are kind of difficult and using them, we can use them in some ways.</p>
<p>So for instance, we use that kind of information to understand and inform these clusters that</p>
<p>I talked about.</p>
<p>And also maybe to add some words like soccer, for instance, to the video, if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>occur in the title or the description, which is remarkable that often it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>One of the things that I ask creators to do is please help us out with the title and the</p>
<p>description.</p>
<p>For instance, we were a few years ago having a live stream of some competition for World</p>
<p>of Warcraft on YouTube.</p>
<p>And it was a very important competition, but if you typed World of Warcraft in search,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft wasn&rsquo;t in the title?</p>
<p>World of Warcraft wasn&rsquo;t in the title.</p>
<p>It was match 478, you know, A team versus B team and World of Warcraft wasn&rsquo;t in the</p>
<p>title.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, come on, give me.</p>
<p>Being literal on the internet is actually very uncool, which is the problem.</p>
<p>Oh, is that right?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, in some sense, well, some of the greatest videos, I mean, there&rsquo;s a humor</p>
<p>to just being indirect, being witty and so on.</p>
<p>And actually being, you know, machine learning algorithms want you to be, you know, literal,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You just want to say what&rsquo;s in the thing, be very, very simple.</p>
<p>And in some sense that gets away from wit and humor.</p>
<p>So you have to play with both, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that for now, sort of the content of the title, the content of the description,</p>
<p>the actual text is one of the best ways for the algorithm to find your video and put them</p>
<p>in the right cluster.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I would go further and say that if you want people, human beings to select your video</p>
<p>in search, then it helps to have, let&rsquo;s say World of Warcraft in the title.</p>
<p>Because why would a person, you know, if they&rsquo;re looking at a bunch, they type World of Warcraft</p>
<p>and they have a bunch of videos, all of whom say World of Warcraft, except the one that</p>
<p>you uploaded.</p>
<p>Well, even the person is going to think, well, maybe this isn&rsquo;t somehow search made a mistake.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really about World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important not just for the machine learning systems, but also for the people</p>
<p>who might be looking for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>They get a clue that it&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re looking for by seeing that same thing prominently</p>
<p>in the title of the video.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me push back on that.</p>
<p>So I think from the algorithm perspective, yes, but if they typed in World of Warcraft</p>
<p>and saw a video that with the title simply winning and the thumbnail has like a sad orc</p>
<p>or something, I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>Like I think that&rsquo;s much, it gets your curiosity up.</p>
<p>And then if they could trust that the algorithm was smart enough to figure out somehow that</p>
<p>this is indeed a World of Warcraft video, that would have created the most beautiful</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>I think in terms of just the wit and the humor and the curiosity that we human beings naturally</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying, I mean, realistically speaking, it&rsquo;s really hard for the algorithm</p>
<p>to figure out that the content of that video will be a World of Warcraft video.</p>
<p>And you have to accept that some people are going to skip it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, and so you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The people who don&rsquo;t skip it and select it are going to be delighted, but other people</p>
<p>might say, yeah, this is not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>And making stuff discoverable, I think is what you&rsquo;re really working on and hoping.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>So from your perspective, put stuff in the title description.</p>
<p>And remember the collaborative filtering part of the system starts by the same user watching</p>
<p>videos together, right?</p>
<p>So the way that they&rsquo;re probably going to do that is by searching for them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating aspect of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ant colonies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they find stuff.</p>
<p>So I mean, what degree for collaborative filtering in general is one curious ant, one curious</p>
<p>user, essential?</p>
<p>So just a person who is more willing to click on random videos and sort of explore these</p>
<p>cluster spaces.</p>
<p>In your sense, how many people are just like watching the same thing over and over and</p>
<p>over and over?</p>
<p>And how many are just like the explorers and just kind of like click on stuff and then</p>
<p>help the other ant in the ant&rsquo;s colony discover the cool stuff?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of that at all?</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think I have a sense for the relative sizes of those groups.</p>
<p>But I would say that people come to YouTube with some certain amount of intent.</p>
<p>And as long as they, to the extent to which they try to satisfy that intent, that certainly</p>
<p>helps our systems, right?</p>
<p>Because our systems rely on kind of a faithful amount of behavior, right?</p>
<p>And there are people who try to trick us, right?</p>
<p>There are people and machines that try to associate videos together that really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>belong together, but they&rsquo;re trying to get that association made because it&rsquo;s profitable</p>
<p>for them.</p>
<p>And so we have to always be resilient to that sort of attempt at gaming the systems.</p>
<p>So speaking to that, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that in a positive way, perhaps, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it, but like to want to try to game the system to get more attention.</p>
<p>Everybody creators in a positive sense want to get attention, right?</p>
<p>So how do you work in this space when people create more and more sort of click baity titles</p>
<p>and thumbnails?</p>
<p>Sort of very to ask him, Derek has made a video where basically describes that it seems</p>
<p>what works is to create a high quality video, really good video, where people would want</p>
<p>to watch it once they click on it, but have click baity titles and thumbnails to get them</p>
<p>to click on it in the first place.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s saying, I&rsquo;m embracing this fact, I&rsquo;m just going to keep doing it.</p>
<p>And I hope you forgive me for doing it and you will enjoy my videos once you click on</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>So in what sense do you see this kind of click bait style attempt to manipulate, to get people</p>
<p>in the door to manipulate the algorithm or play with the algorithm or game the algorithm?</p>
<p>I think that you can look at it as an attempt to game the algorithm.</p>
<p>But even if you were to take the algorithm out of it and just say, okay, well, all these</p>
<p>videos happen to be lined up, which the algorithm didn&rsquo;t make any decision about which one to</p>
<p>put at the top or the bottom, but they&rsquo;re all lined up there, which one are the people</p>
<p>going to choose?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you the same thing that I told Derek is, I have a bookshelf and they have</p>
<p>two kinds of books on them, science books.</p>
<p>I have my math books from when I was a student and they all look identical except for the</p>
<p>titles on the covers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all yellow, they&rsquo;re all from Springer and they&rsquo;re every single one of them.</p>
<p>The cover is totally the same.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have other more pop science type books and they all have very interesting</p>
<p>covers and they have provocative titles and things like that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that they&rsquo;re click baity because they are indeed good books.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that they cross any line, but that&rsquo;s just a decision you have to make.</p>
<p>Like the people who write classical recursion theory by Piero di Freddie, he was fine with</p>
<p>the yellow title and nothing more.</p>
<p>Whereas I think other people who wrote a more popular type book understand that they need</p>
<p>to have a compelling cover and a compelling title.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything really wrong with that.</p>
<p>We do take steps to make sure that there is a line that you don&rsquo;t cross.</p>
<p>And if you go too far, maybe your thumbnail is especially racy or it&rsquo;s all caps with too</p>
<p>many exclamation points, we observe that users are sometimes offended by that.</p>
<p>And so for the users who are offended by that, we will then depress or suppress those videos.</p>
<p>And which reminds me, there&rsquo;s also another signal where users can say, I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>it was recently added, but I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Just saying, something like, I don&rsquo;t want to see this video anymore or something like,</p>
<p>like this is a, like there&rsquo;s certain videos that just cut me the wrong way.</p>
<p>Like just, just jump out at me, it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t want to, I don&rsquo;t want this.</p>
<p>And it feels really good to clean that up, to be like, I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that might&rsquo;ve been recently added, but that&rsquo;s also a really strong signal.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to make a recommendation that people are unhappy with.</p>
<p>And that makes me, that particular one makes me feel good as a user in general and as a</p>
<p>machine learning person.</p>
<p>Cause I feel like I&rsquo;m helping the algorithm.</p>
<p>My interactions on YouTube don&rsquo;t always feel like I&rsquo;m helping the algorithm.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not reminded of that fact.</p>
<p>Like for example, Tesla and Autopilot and Elon Musk create a feeling for their customers,</p>
<p>for people that own Teslas, that they&rsquo;re helping the algorithm of Tesla vehicles.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re all, like are really proud they&rsquo;re helping the fleet learn.</p>
<p>I think YouTube doesn&rsquo;t always remind people that you&rsquo;re helping the algorithm get smarter.</p>
<p>And for me, I love that idea.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all collaboratively, like Wikipedia gives that sense that we&rsquo;re all together creating</p>
<p>a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>YouTube is a, doesn&rsquo;t always remind me of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, this conversation is reminding me of that, but.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s a good tip.</p>
<p>We should keep that fact in mind when we design these features.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I really thought about it that way, but that&rsquo;s a very interesting perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question of personalization that I feel like when I click like on a video,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just improving my experience.</p>
<p>It would be great.</p>
<p>It would make me personally, people are different, but make me feel great if I was helping also</p>
<p>the YouTube algorithm broadly say something.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a, that I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s human nature, but you want the products you</p>
<p>love, and I certainly love YouTube, like you want to help it get smarter, smarter, smarter</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some kind of coupling between our lives together being better.</p>
<p>If YouTube is better than I will, my life will be better.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that kind of reasoning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that is and I&rsquo;m not sure how many people share that feeling.</p>
<p>That could be just a machine learning feeling.</p>
<p>But on that point, how much personalization is there in terms of next video recommendations?</p>
<p>So is it kind of all really boiling down to clustering?</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m the nearest clusters to me and so on and that kind of thing, or how much</p>
<p>is personalized to me, the individual completely?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very personalized.</p>
<p>So your experience will be quite a bit different from anybody else&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s watching that same</p>
<p>video, at least when they&rsquo;re logged in.</p>
<p>And the reason is that we found that users often want two different kinds of things when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re watching a video.</p>
<p>Sometimes they want to keep watching more on that topic or more in that genre.</p>
<p>And other times they just are done and they&rsquo;re ready to move on to something else.</p>
<p>And so the question is, well, what is the something else?</p>
<p>And one of the first things one can imagine is, well, maybe something else is the latest</p>
<p>video from some channel to which you&rsquo;ve subscribed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be very different for you than it is for me.</p>
<p>And even if it&rsquo;s not something that you subscribe to, it&rsquo;s something that you watch a lot.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;ll be very different on a person by person basis.</p>
<p>And so even the Watch Next, as well as the homepage, of course, is quite personalized.</p>
<p>So what, we mentioned some of the signals, but what does success look like?</p>
<p>What does success look like in terms of the algorithm creating a great long term experience</p>
<p>for a user?</p>
<p>Or to put another way, if you look at the videos I&rsquo;ve watched this month, how do you</p>
<p>know the algorithm succeeded for me?</p>
<p>I think, first of all, if you come back and watch more YouTube, then that&rsquo;s one indication</p>
<p>that you found some value from it.</p>
<p>So just the number of hours is a powerful indicator.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, not the hours themselves, but the fact that you return on another day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably the most simple indicator.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t come back to things that they don&rsquo;t find value in, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other things that they could do.</p>
<p>But like I said, ideally, we would like everybody to feel that YouTube enriches their lives</p>
<p>and that every video they watched is the best one they&rsquo;ve ever watched since they&rsquo;ve started</p>
<p>watching YouTube.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why we survey them and ask them, is this one to five stars?</p>
<p>And so our version of success is every time someone takes that survey, they say it&rsquo;s five</p>
<p>stars.</p>
<p>And if we ask them, is this the best video you&rsquo;ve ever seen on YouTube?</p>
<p>They say, yes, every single time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that we would actually achieve that.</p>
<p>Maybe asymptotically we would get there, but that would be what we think success is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently said somewhere, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe tweeted, but that Ray Dalio has this</p>
<p>video on the economic machine, I forget what it&rsquo;s called, but it&rsquo;s a 30 minute video.</p>
<p>And I said it&rsquo;s the greatest video I&rsquo;ve ever watched on YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I watched the whole thing and my mind was blown as a very crisp, clean description</p>
<p>of how the, at least the American economic system works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful video.</p>
<p>And I was just, I wanted to click on something to say this is the best thing.</p>
<p>This is the best thing ever.</p>
<p>Please let me, I can&rsquo;t believe I discovered it.</p>
<p>I mean, the views and the likes reflect its quality, but I was almost upset that I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>found it earlier and wanted to find other things like it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever felt that this is the best video I&rsquo;ve ever watched.</p>
<p>That was that.</p>
<p>And to me, the ultimate utopia, the best experiences were every single video.</p>
<p>Where I don&rsquo;t see any of the videos I regret and every single video I watch is one that</p>
<p>actually helps me grow, helps me enjoy life, be happy and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a heck of a, that&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful and ambitious, I think, machine</p>
<p>learning tasks.</p>
<p>So when you look at a society as opposed to the individual user, do you think of how YouTube</p>
<p>is changing society when you have these millions of people watching videos, growing, learning,</p>
<p>changing, having debates?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of, yeah, what the big impact on society is?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s huge, but do you have a sense of what direction we&rsquo;re taking this world?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think openness has had an impact on society already.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you mean by openness?</p>
<p>Well, the fact that unlike other mediums, there&rsquo;s not someone sitting at YouTube who</p>
<p>decides before you can upload your video, whether it&rsquo;s worth having you upload it or</p>
<p>worth anybody seeing it really, right?</p>
<p>And so there are some creators who say, like, I wouldn&rsquo;t have this opportunity to reach</p>
<p>an audience.</p>
<p>Tyler Oakley often said that he wouldn&rsquo;t have had this opportunity to reach this audience</p>
<p>if it weren&rsquo;t for YouTube.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s one way in which YouTube has changed society.</p>
<p>I know that there are people that I work with from outside the United States, especially</p>
<p>from places where literacy is low, and they think that YouTube can help in those places</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t need to be able to read and write in order to learn something important</p>
<p>for your life, maybe how to do some job or how to fix something.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another way in which I think YouTube is possibly changing society.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve worked at YouTube for eight, almost nine years now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fun because I meet people and you tell them where you work, you say you work</p>
<p>on YouTube and they immediately say, I love YouTube, right?</p>
<p>Which is great, makes me feel great.</p>
<p>But then of course, when I ask them, well, what is it that you love about YouTube?</p>
<p>Not one time ever has anybody said that the search works outstanding or that the recommendations</p>
<p>are great.</p>
<p>What they always say when I ask them, what do you love about YouTube is they immediately</p>
<p>start talking about some channel or some creator or some topic or some community that they</p>
<p>found on YouTube and that they just love.</p>
<p>And so that has made me realize that YouTube is really about the video and connecting the</p>
<p>people with the videos.</p>
<p>And then everything else kind of gets out of the way.</p>
<p>So beyond the video, it&rsquo;s an interesting, because you kind of mentioned creator.</p>
<p>What about the connection with just the individual creators as opposed to just individual video?</p>
<p>So like I gave the example of Ray Dalio video that the video itself is incredible, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some people who are just creators that I love.</p>
<p>One of the cool things about people who call themselves YouTubers or whatever is they have</p>
<p>a journey.</p>
<p>They usually, almost all of them, they suck horribly in the beginning and then they kind</p>
<p>of grow and then there&rsquo;s that genuineness in their growth.</p>
<p>So YouTube clearly wants to help creators connect with their audience in this kind of</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>So how do you think about that process of helping creators grow, helping them connect</p>
<p>with their audience, develop not just individual videos, but the entirety of a creator&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>on YouTube?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we&rsquo;re trying to help creators find the biggest audience that they can find.</p>
<p>And the reason why that&rsquo;s, you brought up creator versus video, the reason why creator</p>
<p>channel is so important is because if we have a hope of people coming back to YouTube, well,</p>
<p>they have to have in their minds some sense of what they&rsquo;re going to find when they come</p>
<p>back to YouTube.</p>
<p>If YouTube were just the next viral video and I have no concept of what the next viral</p>
<p>video could be, one time it&rsquo;s a cat playing a piano and the next day it&rsquo;s some children</p>
<p>interrupting a reporter and the next day it&rsquo;s some other thing happening, then it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>for me to, when I&rsquo;m not watching YouTube, say, gosh, I really would like to see something</p>
<p>from someone or about something, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think this connection between fans and creators is so important</p>
<p>for both, because it&rsquo;s a way of sort of fostering a relationship that can play out into the</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>Let me talk about kind of a dark and interesting question in general, and again, a topic that</p>
<p>you or nobody has an answer to.</p>
<p>But social media has a sense of, it gives us highs and it gives us lows in the sense</p>
<p>that sort of creators often speak about having sort of burnout and having psychological ups</p>
<p>and downs and challenges mentally in terms of continuing the creation process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a momentum, there&rsquo;s a huge excited audience that makes creators feel great.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s more than just financial.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s literally just, they love that sense of community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the reason I upload to YouTube.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about money, never will.</p>
<p>What I care about is the community, but some people feel like this momentum, and even when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s times in their life when they don&rsquo;t feel, you know, for some reason don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like creating.</p>
<p>So how do you think about burnout, this mental exhaustion that some YouTube creators go through?</p>
<p>Is that something we have an answer for?</p>
<p>Is that something, how do we even think about that?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing is we want to make sure that the YouTube systems are not contributing</p>
<p>to this sense, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve done a fair amount of research to demonstrate that you can absolutely take</p>
<p>a break.</p>
<p>If you are a creator and you&rsquo;ve been uploading a lot, we have just as many examples of people</p>
<p>who took a break and came back more popular than they were before as we have examples</p>
<p>of going the other way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can we pause on that for a second?</p>
<p>So the feeling that people have, I think, is if I take a break, everybody, the party</p>
<p>will leave, right?</p>
<p>So if you could just linger on that.</p>
<p>So in your sense that taking a break is okay.</p>
<p>Yes, taking a break is absolutely okay.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is because we have, we can observe many examples of being, of</p>
<p>creators coming back very strong and even stronger after they have taken some sort of</p>
<p>break.</p>
<p>And so I just want to dispel the myth that this somehow necessarily means that your channel</p>
<p>is going to go down or lose views.</p>
<p>That is not the case.</p>
<p>We know for sure that this is not a necessary outcome.</p>
<p>And so we want to encourage people to make sure that they take care of themselves.</p>
<p>That is job one, right?</p>
<p>You have to look after yourself and your mental health.</p>
<p>And I think that it probably, in some of these cases, contributes to better videos once they</p>
<p>come back, right?</p>
<p>Because a lot of people, I mean, I know myself, if I burn out on something, then I&rsquo;m probably</p>
<p>not doing my best work, even though I can keep working until I pass out.</p>
<p>And so I think that the taking a break may even improve the creative ideas that someone</p>
<p>has.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really important thing to sort of dispel.</p>
<p>I think that applies to all of social media, like literally I&rsquo;ve taken a break for a day</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Sorry if that sounds like a short time, but even like, sorry, email, just taking a break</p>
<p>from email, or only checking email once a day, especially when you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>something psychologically in your personal life or so on, or really not sleeping much</p>
<p>because of work deadlines, it can refresh you in a way that&rsquo;s profound.</p>
<p>And so the same applies.</p>
<p>It was there when you came back, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it looks different, actually, when you come back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sort of brighter eyed with some coffee, everything, the world looks better.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to take a break when you need it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned kind of the YouTube algorithm that isn&rsquo;t E equals MC squared, it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>single equation, it&rsquo;s potentially sort of more than a million lines of code.</p>
<p>Is it more akin to what successful autonomous vehicles today are, which is they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>basically patches on top of patches of heuristics and human experts really tuning the algorithm</p>
<p>and have some machine learning modules?</p>
<p>Or is it becoming more and more a giant machine learning system with humans just doing a little</p>
<p>bit of tweaking here and there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>First of all, do you even have a sense of what is the YouTube algorithm at this point?</p>
<p>And however much you do have a sense, what does it look like?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t usually think about it as the algorithm because it&rsquo;s a bunch of systems</p>
<p>that work on different services.</p>
<p>The other thing that I think people don&rsquo;t understand is that what you might refer to</p>
<p>as the YouTube algorithm from outside of YouTube is actually a bunch of code and machine learning</p>
<p>systems and heuristics, but that&rsquo;s married with the behavior of all the people who come</p>
<p>to YouTube every day.</p>
<p>So the people part of the code, essentially.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If there were no people who came to YouTube tomorrow, then the algorithm wouldn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole part of the algorithm.</p>
<p>And so when people talk about, well, the algorithm does this, the algorithm does that, it&rsquo;s sometimes</p>
<p>hard to understand, well, it could be the viewers are doing that.</p>
<p>And the algorithm is mostly just keeping track of what the viewers do and then reacting to</p>
<p>those things in sort of more fine grain situations.</p>
<p>And I think that this is the way that the recommendation system and the search system</p>
<p>and probably many machine learning systems evolve is you start trying to solve a problem</p>
<p>and the first way to solve a problem is often with a simple heuristic.</p>
<p>And you want to say, what are the videos we&rsquo;re going to recommend?</p>
<p>Well, how about the most popular ones?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you start.</p>
<p>And over time, you collect some data and you refine your situation so that you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>less heuristics and you&rsquo;re building a system that can actually learn what to do in different</p>
<p>situations based on some observations of those situations in the past.</p>
<p>And you keep chipping away at these heuristics over time.</p>
<p>And so I think that just like with diversity, I think the first diversity measure we took</p>
<p>was, okay, not more than three videos in a row from the same channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty simple heuristic to encourage diversity, but it worked, right?</p>
<p>Who needs to see four, five, six videos in a row from the same channel?</p>
<p>And over time, we try to chip away at that and make it more fine grain and basically</p>
<p>have it remove the heuristics in favor of something that can react to individuals and</p>
<p>individual situations.</p>
<p>So how do you, you mentioned, you know, we know that something worked.</p>
<p>How do you get a sense when decisions are kind of A, B testing that this idea was a</p>
<p>good one, this was not so good?</p>
<p>How do you measure that and across which time scale, across how many users, that kind of</p>
<p>thing?</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned the A, B experiments.</p>
<p>And so just about every single change we make to YouTube, we do it only after we&rsquo;ve run</p>
<p>a A, B experiment.</p>
<p>And so in those experiments, which run from one week to months, we measure hundreds, literally</p>
<p>hundreds of different variables and measure changes with confidence intervals in all of</p>
<p>them, because we really are trying to get a sense for ultimately, does this improve</p>
<p>the experience for viewers?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question we&rsquo;re trying to answer.</p>
<p>And an experiment is one way because we can see certain things go up and down.</p>
<p>So for instance, if we noticed in the experiment, people are dismissing videos less frequently,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re saying that they&rsquo;re more satisfied, they&rsquo;re giving more videos five stars after</p>
<p>they watch them, then those would be indications that the experiment is successful, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>improving the situation for viewers.</p>
<p>But we can also look at other things, like we might do user studies, where we invite</p>
<p>some people in and ask them, like, what do you think about this?</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>How do you feel about this?</p>
<p>And other various kinds of user research.</p>
<p>But ultimately, before we launch something, we&rsquo;re going to want to run an experiment.</p>
<p>So we get a sense for what the impact is going to be, not just to the viewers, but also to</p>
<p>the different channels and all of that.</p>
<p>An absurd question.</p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p>Well, actually, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s an answer.</p>
<p>But if I want to make a viral video, how do I do it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you make a viral video.</p>
<p>I know that we have in the past tried to figure out if we could detect when a video was going</p>
<p>to go viral.</p>
<p>And those were, you take the first and second derivatives of the view count and maybe use</p>
<p>that to do some prediction.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t say we ever got very good at that.</p>
<p>Oftentimes we look at where the traffic was coming from.</p>
<p>If a lot of the viewership is coming from something like Twitter, then maybe it has</p>
<p>a higher chance of becoming viral than if it were coming from search or something.</p>
<p>But that was just trying to detect a video that might be viral.</p>
<p>How to make one, I have no idea.</p>
<p>You get your kids to interrupt you while you&rsquo;re on the news or something.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But after the fact, on one individual video, sort of ahead of time predicting is a really</p>
<p>hard task.</p>
<p>But after the video went viral, in analysis, can you sometimes understand why it went viral?</p>
<p>From the perspective of YouTube broadly, first of all, is it even interesting for YouTube</p>
<p>that a particular video is viral or does that not matter for the individual, for the experience</p>
<p>of people?</p>
<p>Well, I think people expect that if a video is going viral and it&rsquo;s something they would</p>
<p>be interested in, then I think they would expect YouTube to recommend it to them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if something&rsquo;s going viral, it&rsquo;s good to just let the wave, let people ride the wave</p>
<p>of its violence.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we want to meet people&rsquo;s expectations in that way, of course.</p>
<p>So like I mentioned, I hung out with Derek Mueller a while ago, a couple of months back.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually the person who suggested I talk to you on this podcast.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, Derek.</p>
<p>At that time, he just recently posted an awesome science video titled, why are 96 million black</p>
<p>balls on this reservoir?</p>
<p>And in a matter of, I don&rsquo;t know how long, but like a few days, he got 38 million views</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still growing.</p>
<p>Is this something you can analyze and understand why it happened, this video and you want a</p>
<p>particular video like it?</p>
<p>I mean, we can surely see where it was recommended, where it was found, who watched it and those</p>
<p>sorts of things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually, sorry to interrupt, it is the video which helped me discover who Derek</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who he is before.</p>
<p>So I remember, you know, usually I just have all of these technical, boring MIT Stanford</p>
<p>talks in my recommendation because that&rsquo;s how I watch.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden there&rsquo;s this black balls and reservoir video with like an excited</p>
<p>nerd with like just, why is this being recommended to me?</p>
<p>So I clicked on it and watched the whole thing and it was awesome.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people had that experience, like why was I recommended this?</p>
<p>But they all of course watched it and enjoyed it, which is, what&rsquo;s your sense of this just</p>
<p>wave of recommendation that comes with this viral video that ultimately people get enjoy</p>
<p>after they click on it?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s the system, you know, basically doing what anybody who&rsquo;s recommending something</p>
<p>would do, which is you show it to some people and if they like it, you say, okay, well,</p>
<p>can I find some more people who are a little bit like them?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m going to try it with them.</p>
<p>Oh, they like it too.</p>
<p>Let me expand the circle some more, find some more people.</p>
<p>Oh, it turns out they like it too.</p>
<p>And you just keep going until you get some feedback that says that, no, now you&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>too far.</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t like it anymore.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s basically what happened.</p>
<p>And you asked me about how to make a video go viral or make a viral video.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that if you or I decided to make a video about 96 million balls that it</p>
<p>would also go viral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Derek made like the canonical video about those black balls in the lake.</p>
<p>He did actually.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know whether or not just following along is the secret.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, just like you said, the algorithm sort of expanding that circle and then figuring</p>
<p>out that more and more people did enjoy it and that sort of phase shift of just a huge</p>
<p>number of people enjoying it and the algorithm quickly, automatically, I assume, figuring</p>
<p>that out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the dynamics of psychology of that is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the idea of clipping?</p>
<p>Too many people annoyed me into doing it, which is they were requesting it.</p>
<p>They said it would be very beneficial to add clips in like the coolest points and actually</p>
<p>have explicit videos.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m re uploading a video, like a short clip, which is what the podcasts are doing.</p>
<p>Do you see as opposed to, like I also add timestamps for the topics, do you want the</p>
<p>clip?</p>
<p>Do you see YouTube somehow helping creators with that process or helping connect clips</p>
<p>to the original videos or is that just on a long list of amazing features to work towards?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not something that I think we&rsquo;ve done yet, but I can tell you that I think</p>
<p>clipping is great and I think it&rsquo;s actually great for you as a creator.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the reason.</p>
<p>If you think about, I mean, let&rsquo;s say the NBA is uploading videos of its games.</p>
<p>Well, people might search for warriors versus rockets or they might search for Steph Curry.</p>
<p>And so a highlight from the game in which Steph Curry makes an amazing shot is an opportunity</p>
<p>for someone to find a portion of that video.</p>
<p>And so I think that you never know how people are going to search for something that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>created.</p>
<p>And so you want to, I would say you want to make clips and add titles and things like</p>
<p>that so that they can find it as easily as possible.</p>
<p>Do you have a dream of a future, perhaps a distant future when the YouTube algorithm</p>
<p>figures that out?</p>
<p>Sort of automatically detects the parts of the video that are really interesting, exciting,</p>
<p>potentially exciting for people and sort of clip them out in this incredibly rich space.</p>
<p>Cause if you talk about, if you talk, even just this conversation, we probably covered</p>
<p>30, 40 little topics and there&rsquo;s a huge space of users that would find, you know, 30% of</p>
<p>those topics really interesting.</p>
<p>And that space is very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s beyond my ability to clip out, right?</p>
<p>But the algorithm might be able to figure all that out, sort of expand into clips.</p>
<p>Do you have a, do you think about this kind of thing?</p>
<p>Do you have a hope or dream that one day the algorithm will be able to do that kind of</p>
<p>deep content analysis?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve actually had projects that attempt to achieve this, but it really does depend</p>
<p>on understanding the video well and our understanding of the video right now is quite crude.</p>
<p>And so I think it would be especially hard to do it with a conversation like this.</p>
<p>One might be able to do it with, let&rsquo;s say a soccer match more easily, right?</p>
<p>You could probably find out where the goals were scored.</p>
<p>And then of course you, you need to figure out who it was that scored the goal and, and</p>
<p>that might require a human to do some annotation.</p>
<p>But I think that trying to identify coherent topics in a transcript, like, like the one</p>
<p>of our conversation is, is not something that we&rsquo;re going to be very good at right away.</p>
<p>And I was speaking more to the general problem actually of being able to do both a soccer</p>
<p>match and our conversation without explicit sort of almost my, my hope was that there</p>
<p>exists an algorithm that&rsquo;s able to find exciting things in video.</p>
<p>So Google now on Google search will help you find the segment of the video that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>interested in.</p>
<p>So if you search for something like how to change the filter in my dishwasher, then if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a long video about your dishwasher and this is the part where the person shows</p>
<p>you how to change the filter, then, then it will highlight that area.</p>
<p>And provide a link directly to it.</p>
<p>And do you know if, from your recollection, do you know if the thumbnail reflects, like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between showing the full video and the shorter clip?</p>
<p>Do you know how it&rsquo;s presented in search results?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how it&rsquo;s presented.</p>
<p>And the other thing I would say is that right now it&rsquo;s based on creator annotations.</p>
<p>Ah, got it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the thing we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But folks are working on the more automatic version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, people might not imagine this, but a lot of our systems start by using</p>
<p>almost entirely the audience behavior.</p>
<p>And then as they get better, the refinement comes from using the content.</p>
<p>And I wish, I know there&rsquo;s privacy concerns, but I wish YouTube explored the space, which</p>
<p>is sort of putting a camera on the users if they allowed it, right, to study their, like,</p>
<p>I did a lot of emotion recognition work and so on, to study actual sort of richer signal.</p>
<p>One of the cool things when you upload 360 like VR video to YouTube, and I&rsquo;ve done this</p>
<p>a few times, so I&rsquo;ve uploaded myself, it&rsquo;s a horrible idea.</p>
<p>Some people enjoyed it, but whatever.</p>
<p>The video of me giving a lecture in 360 with a 360 camera, and it&rsquo;s cool because YouTube</p>
<p>allows you to then watch where did people look at?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a heat map of where, you know, of where the center of the VR experience was.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because that reveals to you, like, what people looked at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always what you were expecting.</p>
<p>In the case of the lecture, it&rsquo;s pretty boring, it is what we were expecting, but we did a</p>
<p>few funny videos where there&rsquo;s a bunch of people doing things, and everybody tracks</p>
<p>those people.</p>
<p>You know, in the beginning, they all look at the main person and they start spreading</p>
<p>around and looking at the other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So that kind of, that&rsquo;s a really strong signal of what people found exciting in the video.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you get that from people just watching, except they tuned out at this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s hard to measure this moment was super exciting for people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you get that signal.</p>
<p>Maybe comment, is there a way to get that signal where this was like, this is when their</p>
<p>eyes opened up and they&rsquo;re like, like for me with the Ray Dalio video, right?</p>
<p>Like at first I was like, okay, this is another one of these like dumb it down for you videos.</p>
<p>And then you like start watching, it&rsquo;s like, okay, there&rsquo;s really crisp, clean, deep explanation</p>
<p>of how the economy works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I like set up and started watching, right?</p>
<p>That moment, is there a way to detect that moment?</p>
<p>The only way I can think of is by asking people to label it.</p>
<p>You mentioned that we&rsquo;re quite far away in terms of doing video analysis, deep video</p>
<p>analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, Google, YouTube, you know, we&rsquo;re quite far away from solving autonomous driving</p>
<p>problem too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re closer to that.</p>
<p>Well, the, you know, you never know.</p>
<p>And the Wright brothers thought they&rsquo;re never, they&rsquo;re not going to fly for 50 years, three</p>
<p>years before they flew.</p>
<p>So what are the biggest challenges would you say?</p>
<p>Is it the broad challenge of understanding video, understanding natural language, understanding</p>
<p>the challenge before the entire machine learning community or just being able to understand</p>
<p>data?</p>
<p>Is there something specific to video that&rsquo;s even more challenging than understanding natural</p>
<p>language understanding?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense of what the biggest challenge is?</p>
<p>Video is just so much information.</p>
<p>And so precision becomes a real problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, you&rsquo;re trying to classify something and you&rsquo;ve got a million classes</p>
<p>and the distinctions among them, at least from a machine learning perspective are often</p>
<p>pretty small, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, you need to see this person&rsquo;s number in order to know which player it is.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of players or you need to see, you know, the logo on their chest in</p>
<p>order to know like which team they play for.</p>
<p>And so, and that&rsquo;s just figuring out who&rsquo;s who, right?</p>
<p>And then you go further and saying, okay, well, you know, was that a goal?</p>
<p>Was it not a goal?</p>
<p>Like, is that an interesting moment as you said, or is that not an interesting moment?</p>
<p>These things can be pretty hard.</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p>So Yann LeCun, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar sort of with his current thinking and work.</p>
<p>So he believes that self, what he&rsquo;s referring to as self supervised learning will be the</p>
<p>solution sort of to achieving this kind of greater level of intelligence.</p>
<p>In fact, the thing he&rsquo;s focusing on is watching video and predicting the next frame.</p>
<p>So predicting the future of video, right?</p>
<p>So for now we&rsquo;re very far from that, but his thought is because it&rsquo;s unsupervised or as</p>
<p>he refers to as self supervised, you know, if you watch enough video, essentially if</p>
<p>you watch YouTube, you&rsquo;ll be able to learn about the nature of reality, the physics,</p>
<p>the common sense reasoning required by just teaching a system to predict the next frame.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s confident this is the way to go.</p>
<p>So for you, from the perspective of just working with this video, how do you think an algorithm</p>
<p>that just watches all of YouTube, stays up all day and night watching YouTube would be</p>
<p>able to understand enough of the physics of the world about the way this world works,</p>
<p>be able to do common sense reasoning and so on?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we have systems that already watch all the videos on YouTube, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re just looking for very specific things, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supervised learning systems that are trying to identify something or classify something.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if, I don&rsquo;t know if predicting the next frame is really going to get there</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not an expert on compression algorithms, but I understand that that&rsquo;s kind of what</p>
<p>compression video compression algorithms do is they basically try to predict the next</p>
<p>frame and then fix up the places where they got it wrong.</p>
<p>And that leads to higher compression than if you actually put all the bits for the next</p>
<p>frame there.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if I believe that just being able to predict the next frame is going to</p>
<p>be enough because there&rsquo;s so many frames and even a tiny bit of error on a per frame basis</p>
<p>can lead to wildly different videos.</p>
<p>So the thing is, the idea of compression is one way to do compression is to describe through</p>
<p>text what&rsquo;s contained in the video.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ultimate high level of compression.</p>
<p>So the idea is traditionally when you think of video image compression, you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to maintain the same visual quality while reducing the size.</p>
<p>But if you think of deep learning from a bigger perspective of what compression is, is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to summarize the video.</p>
<p>And the idea there is if you have a big enough neural network, just by watching the next,</p>
<p>trying to predict the next frame, you&rsquo;ll be able to form a compression of actually understanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the scene.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s two people talking, you can just reduce that entire video into the fact that</p>
<p>two people are talking and maybe the content of what they&rsquo;re saying and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the open ended dream.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to sort of express that because it&rsquo;s interesting, compelling notion, but it</p>
<p>is nevertheless true that video, our world is a lot more complicated than we get a credit</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>I mean, in terms of search and discovery, we have been working on trying to summarize</p>
<p>videos in text or with some kind of labels for eight years at least.</p>
<p>And you know, and we&rsquo;re kind of so, so.</p>
<p>So if you were to say the problem is a hundred percent solved and eight years ago was zero</p>
<p>percent solved, where are we on that timeline would you say?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To summarize a video well, maybe less than a quarter of the way.</p>
<p>So on that topic, what does YouTube look like 10, 20, 30 years from now?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that YouTube is evolving to take the place of TV.</p>
<p>I grew up as a kid in the seventies and I watched a tremendous amount of television</p>
<p>and I feel sorry for my poor mom because people told her at the time that it was going to</p>
<p>rot my brain and that she should kill her television.</p>
<p>But anyway, I mean, I think that YouTube is at least for my family, a better version of</p>
<p>television, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that is on demand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more tailored to the things that my kids want to watch.</p>
<p>And also they can find things that they would never have found on television.</p>
<p>And so I think that at least from just observing my own family, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed is</p>
<p>that people watch YouTube kind of in the same way that I watched television when I was younger.</p>
<p>So from a search and discovery perspective, what do you, what are you excited about in</p>
<p>the five, 10, 20, 30 years?</p>
<p>Like what kind of things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already really good.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s achieved a lot of, of course we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the task of search of typing in the text or discovering new videos by the next</p>
<p>recommendation.</p>
<p>So I personally am really happy with the experience.</p>
<p>I continuously, I rarely watch a video that&rsquo;s not awesome from my own perspective, but what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>what else is possible?</p>
<p>What are you excited about?</p>
<p>Well, I think introducing people to more of what&rsquo;s available on YouTube is not only very</p>
<p>important to YouTube and to creators, but I think it will help enrich people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot that I&rsquo;m still finding out is available on YouTube that I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working YouTube eight years and it wasn&rsquo;t until last year that I learned that,</p>
<p>that I could watch USC football games from the 1970s.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t even know that was possible until last year and I&rsquo;ve been working here</p>
<p>quite some time.</p>
<p>So, you know, what was broken about, about that?</p>
<p>That it took me seven years to learn that this stuff was already on YouTube even when</p>
<p>I got here.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a big opportunity there.</p>
<p>And then as I said before, you know, we want to make sure that YouTube finds a way to ensure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s acting responsibly with respect to society and enriching people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>So we want to take all of the great things that it does and make sure that we are eliminating</p>
<p>the negative consequences that might happen.</p>
<p>And then lastly, if we could get to a point where all the videos people watch are the</p>
<p>best ones they&rsquo;ve ever watched, that&rsquo;d be outstanding too.</p>
<p>Do you see in many senses becoming a window into the world for people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially with live video, you get to watch events.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s the way you experience a lot of the world that&rsquo;s out there is better</p>
<p>than TV in many, many ways.</p>
<p>So do you see becoming more than just video?</p>
<p>Do you see creators creating visual experiences and virtual worlds that if I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>crazy now, but sort of virtual reality and entering that space, or is that at least for</p>
<p>now totally outside what YouTube is thinking about?</p>
<p>I mean, I think Google is thinking about virtual reality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about virtual reality too much.</p>
<p>I know that we would want to make sure that YouTube is there when virtual reality becomes</p>
<p>something or if virtual reality becomes something that a lot of people are interested in.</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t seen it really take off yet.</p>
<p>Take off.</p>
<p>Well, the future is wide open.</p>
<p>Christos, I&rsquo;ve been really looking forward to this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a huge honor.</p>
<p>Thank you for answering some of the more difficult questions I&rsquo;ve asked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about what YouTube has in store for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the greatest products I&rsquo;ve ever used and continues.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
