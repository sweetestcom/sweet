<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Tim Cook: Good morning, and welcome to WWDC.</p>
<p>We have a big day of announcements</p>
<p>about our latest technologies and platforms.</p>
<p>These platforms, and the products they drive,</p>
<p>deliver amazing experiences for our users</p>
<p>and provide developers with incredible opportunities</p>
<p>so they can use their superpowers to innovate, create,</p>
<p>and collaborate, making apps that continue to change the world.</p>
<p>And WWDC is designed to give this community</p>
<p>what they need to do their very best work.</p>
<p>We love to support our developers beyond WWDC</p>
<p>with comprehensive world-class support and other important initiatives.</p>
<p>We just opened our brand-new Developers Center across from Apple Park</p>
<p>where developers can engage with our engineers.</p>
<p>And to reach our global community,</p>
<p>this past fall we introduced our first online Tech Talks for developers</p>
<p>to learn more about our new technologies</p>
<p>and directly connect with Apple engineers</p>
<p>in live sessions and one-on-one office hours.</p>
<p>We are also committed to cultivating the next generation of developers,</p>
<p>including efforts to reach underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>So our developer academies teach students the fundamentals of coding</p>
<p>as well as the other necessary skills</p>
<p>to find and create jobs in the app economy.</p>
<p>There are 17 around the world</p>
<p>including the academy in Detroit we founded in October</p>
<p>as a part of Apple&rsquo;s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.</p>
<p>And in Saudi Arabia, we launched our first developer academy for women in February.</p>
<p>Our Entrepreneur Camps provide developers from underrepresented communities</p>
<p>with mentorship, inspiration, and insights from Apple.</p>
<p>The first camps were for female founders, and this past year,</p>
<p>we expanded the camps to reach Black and Latin founders.</p>
<p>Alumni have gone on to secure major funding</p>
<p>and see great success on the App Store.</p>
<p>These ongoing efforts empower all developers with the tools,</p>
<p>technologies, and inspiration to change the world for the better.</p>
<p>Last year, many millions of developers engaged in WWDC,</p>
<p>and we expect millions more to join us again this year.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re excited to say we&rsquo;ve grown our developer community</p>
<p>to over 34 million Apple developers.</p>
<p>We have a huge week ahead of us, with an amazing online experience,</p>
<p>including sessions, labs, and digital lounges,</p>
<p>which will all be available for free to our developers.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to push our platforms further than ever</p>
<p>for our developers and our users.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started by sending it over to Craig.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Craig Federighi: I&rsquo;m really excited about what we have to show you today.</p>
<p>But first, let&rsquo;s head downstairs.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about iOS.</p>
<p>Together with iPhone, iOS helps you get so much done,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re at home or on the move.</p>
<p>And the next release, iOS 16, offers new intelligence,</p>
<p>sharing, and communication features that are going to enhance</p>
<p>so much of what you do with your iPhone.</p>
<p>And those come together with an incredible set of new personalization features</p>
<p>that will make your experience feel fresh and completely you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started with the all-new Lock Screen.</p>
<p>The Lock Screen is the first thing you see every time you pick up your iPhone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where you can check the date and time,</p>
<p>look out for key messages,</p>
<p>and launch the camera to quickly capture the moment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just as much a place for personalization,</p>
<p>where so many of you put a photo that makes iPhone uniquely yours.</p>
<p>In iOS 16, we&rsquo;re bringing the biggest update ever to the Lock Screen,</p>
<p>completely reimagining how it looks and works for you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Craig: The new Lock Screen remains undeniably iPhone,</p>
<p>while also giving you new ways to make it more personal,</p>
<p>beautiful, and helpful than ever.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my Lock Screen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the subtle depth effect</p>
<p>with my daughters appearing in front of the time.</p>
<p>I really love it.</p>
<p>Now, if I just press and hold, I can personalize it further.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tap Customize, and now I&rsquo;m in the editor.</p>
<p>Now, check this out.</p>
<p>I can simply swipe to try out different styles</p>
<p>that automatically change the color filter, the background,</p>
<p>and the font for the time, all to complement each other.</p>
<p>These look really beautiful.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go with this one.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if I want to change anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to dial it in further to get it just the way I want it.</p>
<p>All I need to do is tap on any element of the Lock Screen to start editing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s customize the font.</p>
<p>I can audition different typefaces</p>
<p>and choose from different colors.</p>
<p>And I like this color. I&rsquo;ll just adjust the shade a little bit.</p>
<p>I think this looks awesome now.</p>
<p>Now, I can also make my Lock Screen more helpful</p>
<p>by putting widgets right on the Lock Screen.</p>
<p>So let me move the girls down here</p>
<p>and tap in to bring up the widget gallery.</p>
<p>And these are really useful for getting information at a glance,</p>
<p>like upcoming calendar events.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll add the temperature,</p>
<p>my Activity rings, and let&rsquo;s drag in the calendar widget.</p>
<p>Now, this is great.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s even better is, I&rsquo;m not limited to just one.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create another.</p>
<p>I can bring up our brand-new wallpaper gallery,</p>
<p>which showcases a bunch of options for inspiration.</p>
<p>And there are plenty to choose from here.</p>
<p>So much room for personalization, with millions of combinations.</p>
<p>With Photo Shuffle, I can choose a set of photos to shuffle throughout the day,</p>
<p>And we also have Suggested Photos,</p>
<p>intelligently curated from my personal library,</p>
<p>like the best shots of family that look great on the Lock Screen.</p>
<p>Now, this is an awesome one to add to my collection.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve created a bunch of other Lock Screens,</p>
<p>and by simply swiping, I can switch between them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing the range you can create.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Weather, which shows live weather conditions</p>
<p>like a downpour and lightning.</p>
<p>I just love this animation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a really cool emoji wallpaper</p>
<p>and our Pride wallpaper.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s one from our Astronomy collection.</p>
<p>Watch how it animates fluidly as I swipe into the Home Screen.</p>
<p>So cool.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a quick look at the all-new Lock Screen.</p>
<p>And for developers, WidgetKit makes it quick and easy</p>
<p>to put glanceable information from their app here as well.</p>
<p>The new Lock Screen is so beautiful, we wanted to make sure</p>
<p>that you can always enjoy it, even if you get a lot of notifications.</p>
<p>Sometimes, notifications can cover up your personal photo.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve rethought how they appear.</p>
<p>Notifications now roll in from the bottom of the Lock Screen as you receive them,</p>
<p>and you can choose to hide them throughout the day.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes you get a bunch of notifications from an app,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re following the score of a basketball game.</p>
<p>Well, now there&rsquo;s a better way to keep tabs</p>
<p>with something called Live Activities.</p>
<p>Live Activities make it easier to stay on top of things</p>
<p>that are happening in real time right from your Lock Screen.</p>
<p>And for developers, starting in an update to iOS 16 later this year,</p>
<p>they can use the Live Activities API</p>
<p>to create these compact and glanceable experiences.</p>
<p>This will make it really easy to follow that NBA game,</p>
<p>track the progress of an Uber ride,</p>
<p>see how you&rsquo;re doing on your workout, and more,</p>
<p>all while letting the other elements on the Lock Screen shine.</p>
<p>One of the most popular activities for many of us is listening to music.</p>
<p>And now with Live Activities, the Now Playing controls can expand</p>
<p>to a full screen view that celebrates album art while you listen along.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the all-new Lock Screen.</p>
<p>There are some really powerful ways these updates tie together</p>
<p>and build upon what we introduced last year with Focus.</p>
<p>Focus has helped people reduce distractions and stay in the moment.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re taking it further,</p>
<p>starting with extending Focus to your Lock Screen.</p>
<p>This means your choice of a photo and widgets</p>
<p>can all be tied to a particular Focus.</p>
<p>And now that you can have multiple Lock Screens,</p>
<p>you can match them to the appropriate Focus throughout your day.</p>
<p>You can have a dedicated one for when you&rsquo;re in a Work Focus,</p>
<p>with widgets showing your upcoming meeting or to-do list.</p>
<p>Or, with just a swipe, you can activate your Personal Focus.</p>
<p>All of your corresponding notification settings apply,</p>
<p>and it extends to your Home Screen too.</p>
<p>So now you can elevate your favorite apps or widgets</p>
<p>for keeping up with friends and family.</p>
<p>And now, your Focus can also carry into the apps themselves,</p>
<p>with Focus filters, which let you filter out distracting content.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take Safari, for example.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing all of your websites,</p>
<p>you can turn on the Work Focus filter and see only the tabs that relate to work.</p>
<p>And you can filter not just tab groups in Safari,</p>
<p>but also conversations in Messages, accounts in Mail, and events in Calendar.</p>
<p>And for developers, we have a new API</p>
<p>so they can help you focus in their apps as well.</p>
<p>These updates to Focus can help you draw boundaries</p>
<p>and find balance throughout all of the moments in your life.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about what&rsquo;s in store for Messages.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people rely on Messages every single day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s integral to how we communicate with the people who matter most.</p>
<p>And now, we&rsquo;re adding three of the most highly-requested features to Messages.</p>
<p>First, have you ever sent a Message only to immediately realize</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t quite say what you intended?</p>
<p>Well, no worries.</p>
<p>Because now you can edit any message you just sent</p>
<p>so embarrassing typos can be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Second, have you ever wished you&rsquo;d never sent that message at all?</p>
<p>Well, good news‚Äìnow you have undo send,</p>
<p>so you can immediately recall a recent misfire.</p>
<p>And finally, you can now mark any thread as unread,</p>
<p>a perfect tool if you don&rsquo;t have time to respond in the moment</p>
<p>and want to be sure to come back to a message later.</p>
<p>These three features are going to make a big difference</p>
<p>in how you use Messages every single day.</p>
<p>Messages makes texting easy and efficient, and it&rsquo;s also a great way to share.</p>
<p>Last year, we introduced Shared with You, which takes things like photos, links,</p>
<p>and music that your friends share with you in Messages and highlights them</p>
<p>right in the app where you&rsquo;d like to enjoy them later.</p>
<p>And for developers, we&rsquo;re really excited</p>
<p>to make Shared with You available with a new API.</p>
<p>So when someone sends you a funny video, a worthwhile article,</p>
<p>or a recipe that you don&rsquo;t have time to check out in the moment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be there waiting for you the next time you open that app.</p>
<p>And when it comes to sharing in real time with others, people are loving SharePlay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stellar for enjoying shared experiences</p>
<p>while connecting over FaceTime.</p>
<p>Like watching TV shows, listening to music,</p>
<p>or breaking a sweat to a synced up workout.</p>
<p>So many of your favorite apps are using SharePlay</p>
<p>to create shared experiences,</p>
<p>like listening to bedtime stories together with Better Sleep</p>
<p>or playing a rowdy game of Heads Up, no matter how far apart you are.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re making it easier to discover</p>
<p>all of these awesome SharePlay experiences from within your FaceTime call.</p>
<p>With just a tap, you can jump into SharePlay-supported apps</p>
<p>that you already have on your phone, or discover new experiences</p>
<p>that you can share with your friends.</p>
<p>And to give you more opportunities to enjoy shared experiences,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re extending SharePlay beyond FaceTime and bringing it to Messages.</p>
<p>This was the number one request from developers.</p>
<p>Now when you find something you want to share,</p>
<p>like a movie on Disney+, you can kick off SharePlay right there</p>
<p>and enjoy it together while chatting in Messages.</p>
<p>You can watch in sync, and you&rsquo;ve got the same instantaneous</p>
<p>shared playback controls that make SharePlay magical.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re using SharePlay for your weekly movie night</p>
<p>or marking a message unread so you can respond later,</p>
<p>Messages has everything you need to connect with ease.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re making it that much easier to compose Messages</p>
<p>with some updates to Dictation.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Robby.</p>
<p>Robby Walker: Dictation lets you type just by speaking</p>
<p>and can be much faster than typing with the Keyboard.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so popular for taking notes, sending messages, and more.</p>
<p>In fact, Dictation is used over 18 billion times each month.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s designed to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Neural Engine, Dictation can happen entirely on-device.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re excited to introduce an all-new on-device Dictation experience</p>
<p>that lets you fluidly move between voice and touch.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use our new dictation experience to send an email.</p>
<p>Now, when I start dictating, the keyboard stays open,</p>
<p>so I can switch between using voice and touch.</p>
<p>I can even select text using touch and replace it with my voice.</p>
<p>Just by speaking.</p>
<p>Are you sending a longer message?</p>
<p>Dictation automatically adds punctuation to the text.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool! Mind blown emoji!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Automatic punctuation and emoji dictation also work</p>
<p>when you send messages with Siri.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re making it easier to use Siri with apps.</p>
<p>There are over 15,000 apps that work with Siri</p>
<p>using SiriKit and Siri Shortcuts.</p>
<p>And today, these require manual setup.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re introducing a new developer API</p>
<p>built using the Swift programming language called App Intents.</p>
<p>Now shortcuts work with zero setup</p>
<p>so you can use Siri to get things done with supported apps.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about another feature powered by intelligence: Live Text.</p>
<p>Live Text is so useful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s deeply integrated across the entire OS,</p>
<p>letting you interact with text in images across the system,</p>
<p>from Camera and Safari to Notes and Screenshots.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re excited to take this integration further</p>
<p>by bringing Live Text to video.</p>
<p>Now you can pause a video on any frame and interact with text</p>
<p>just like you can today with photos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for copying code samples.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also accelerating the things you do with Live Text with quick actions.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re just a tap away from converting currency</p>
<p>and translating a foreign language.</p>
<p>And for an even richer translation experience,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to use Live Text while in the Translate app,</p>
<p>with our new camera view.</p>
<p>This will be great for when you have lots of text to translate.</p>
<p>And for developers, we&rsquo;re also excited to announce a Live Text API.</p>
<p>Soon you will be able to grab text straight from photos</p>
<p>and videos in apps like Vimeo.</p>
<p>And photos are about more than just text.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why last year we introduced Visual Look Up,</p>
<p>a feature that recognizes objects like pets, landmarks, plants, and more,</p>
<p>and gives you rich information about what&rsquo;s in your images.</p>
<p>And this year we have a new feature that takes image understanding further.</p>
<p>Now when you touch and hold on the subject of an image,</p>
<p>you can lift it away from the background and place it in apps like Messages.</p>
<p>It feels like magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the product of an advanced machine learning model</p>
<p>which is accelerated by CoreML</p>
<p>and the Neural Engine to perform 40 billion operations</p>
<p>in just milliseconds.</p>
<p>Together, Live Text and Visual Look Up continue to unlock</p>
<p>rich and useful information from your photos and videos</p>
<p>across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: These intelligence features help you get things done with ease.</p>
<p>And another app that makes life easier is Wallet.</p>
<p>To tell you about what&rsquo;s new in Wallet, I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Corey.</p>
<p>Corey Fugman: With Apple Wallet, we&rsquo;re working hard</p>
<p>on our goal to replace your physical wallet.</p>
<p>Take what we&rsquo;re doing with driver&rsquo;s licenses and ID cards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to have launched Maryland and Arizona,</p>
<p>with 11 additional states actively working on deployments.</p>
<p>And the first locations now accepting Wallet IDs</p>
<p>are select TSA security checkpoints.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also be able to securely present your ID</p>
<p>to apps requiring identity and age verification.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, only the necessary information will be shared.</p>
<p>So rather than providing your exact birthday,</p>
<p>you can simply share that you are over 21.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about Keys.</p>
<p>Our growing suite of keys in Wallet makes it easy to access everyday places</p>
<p>like your home, car, hotel, and office, all with just your iPhone.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re making sharing keys even easier</p>
<p>with your favorite messaging apps like Mail, Messages, or WhatsApp.</p>
<p>When your friend receives the key, they can add it to their Wallet</p>
<p>with a single tap.</p>
<p>And to let you share keys with people who don&rsquo;t have an iPhone,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working with the IETF to make sharing keys an industry standard</p>
<p>that is free for others to adopt.</p>
<p>We are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our partners,</p>
<p>with more of them signing on to support keys for all of the places you visit.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about Apple Pay, one of the most important areas of Wallet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress with Apple Pay acceptance</p>
<p>in stores and online, and now we&rsquo;re expanding even further.</p>
<p>Starting this month with Tap to Pay on iPhone,</p>
<p>millions of merchants across the U.S. can accept contactless payments</p>
<p>directly on iPhone with no additional hardware or payment terminal needed.</p>
<p>Beginning with apps from these payment providers,</p>
<p>Tap to Pay on iPhone enables small merchants and large retailers</p>
<p>to use iPhone to securely accept payments.</p>
<p>In addition to expanded acceptance, we&rsquo;re also enhancing Apple Pay</p>
<p>to support new types of payments.</p>
<p>So we are thrilled to announce Apple Pay Later.</p>
<p>Apple Pay Later lets you split the cost of an Apple Pay purchase</p>
<p>into four equal payments spread over six weeks</p>
<p>with zero interest and no fees of any kind.</p>
<p>And Apple Pay Later is available everywhere Apple Pay is accepted</p>
<p>in apps and online.</p>
<p>You can now get that espresso machine you&rsquo;ve wanted</p>
<p>and pay for it over time with no additional cost.</p>
<p>For developers and merchants, Apple Pay Later requires no integration.</p>
<p>It just works using their standard Apple Pay implementation.</p>
<p>Upcoming payments are managed through Wallet,</p>
<p>making it easy to keep track of what&rsquo;s due when</p>
<p>and to stay within a budget.</p>
<p>And after you&rsquo;ve placed your order,</p>
<p>we have another brand-new feature that helps you track it.</p>
<p>Apple Pay Order Tracking enables merchants</p>
<p>to deliver detailed receipt and tracking information directly to Wallet,</p>
<p>making it easy to get the latest information</p>
<p>on all of your Apple Pay orders delivered securely and privately to your device.</p>
<p>Apple Pay Order Tracking will be offered at millions of merchants</p>
<p>through eCommerce platforms starting with Shopify.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s our Wallet update. Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: With ID cards available in more locations,</p>
<p>new ways to use and share keys,</p>
<p>Apple Pay Later, and Apple Pay Order Tracking,</p>
<p>Wallet makes life so much easier, no matter where you go.</p>
<p>And the best way to get wherever you&rsquo;re going is with Maps.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get out of here to talk about what&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building the best map to help you navigate and explore the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve launched our redesigned map in ten countries and regions,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re excited to announce that later this year,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll bring the new map to 11 more, including France,</p>
<p>Switzerland, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our new map includes great features like cycling, Look Around, and so many more.</p>
<p>And with the new city experience, we pushed it even further</p>
<p>with unprecedented detail for landcover, roads, and elevation,</p>
<p>as well as improved driving and transit navigation.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re adding Las Vegas, which looks stunning.</p>
<p>And before the end of the year, we&rsquo;ll add six more cities</p>
<p>including Miami, Chicago, and Sydney.</p>
<p>To tell you more about what&rsquo;s new in Maps, here&rsquo;s Meg.</p>
<p>Meg Frost: With iOS 16, we&rsquo;re introducing great updates</p>
<p>for Maps users and developers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with one of our most requested features:</p>
<p>multistop routing.</p>
<p>You can now plan up to 15 stops in advance.</p>
<p>Maps will now store previous routes in Recents so they&rsquo;re easy to get back to</p>
<p>and you can plan multi-stop routes on the Mac</p>
<p>and send them to iPhone when you&rsquo;re ready to go.</p>
<p>And, of course, when you&rsquo;re driving,</p>
<p>you can ask Siri to add additional stops to your route</p>
<p>while safely keeping your eyes on the road.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about getting around with transit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making it easy for riders to see fares</p>
<p>for how much their journey will cost</p>
<p>along with the ability to add transit cards to Wallet.</p>
<p>And if a transit card balance is running low</p>
<p>, you&rsquo;ll receive an alert</p>
<p>so you can reload it without having to leave Maps.</p>
<p>And for developers, we&rsquo;re making big improvements to MapKit,</p>
<p>starting with our revolutionary new city experience</p>
<p>which includes rich details for landcover, roads, landmarks, and more.</p>
<p>Developers like Bird can now integrate this detailed map</p>
<p>so users can more easily locate bikes and scooters to get around town.</p>
<p>And it looks stunning in both Light and Dark Mode.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also bringing Look Around to MapKit,</p>
<p>making it easy to integrate high resolution imagery from Maps</p>
<p>into apps like Zillow,</p>
<p>helping users get an immersive ground-level view while browsing homes.</p>
<p>And finally, we&rsquo;re excited to announce that later this year,</p>
<p>developers will have faster and more flexible ways</p>
<p>to build incredible Maps experiences with brand-new server-side APIs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a quick look at Maps.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig!</p>
<p>Craig: Now, let&rsquo;s talk about sports.</p>
<p>Sports can bring people together in meaningful ways,</p>
<p>whether a heated rivalry among friends</p>
<p>or a whole town rooting for their team.</p>
<p>And at Apple, we want to create great experiences for sports fans everywhere.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Rubie.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Rubie Edmondson: Today, there are many ways to keep up with your favorite sports,</p>
<p>like being able to ask Siri about players or teams</p>
<p>or see live games, no matter where they&rsquo;re streaming.</p>
<p>And now with Live Activities, the Apple TV app brings you scores</p>
<p>and play-by-play action right on your Lock Screen.</p>
<p>We also recently premiered Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+</p>
<p>where you can stream two great games every Friday.</p>
<p>And today, we have another major update for sports in Apple News.</p>
<p>Apple News is the number one news app everywhere it&rsquo;s available,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about to become amazing for sports fans.</p>
<p>You can now follow your favorite teams and leagues to get stories</p>
<p>from hundreds of the best publishers in an all-new section called My Sports.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find scores, schedules, and standings for the top professional</p>
<p>and college sports leagues, and highlights too.</p>
<p>Now you can catch the best plays from your favorite teams right in your news feed.</p>
<p>And your favorites are seamlessly synced with the Apple TV app</p>
<p>and across all your Apple devices.</p>
<p>This new sports experience is free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be available in the U.S., UK, Canada, and Australia.</p>
<p>And when you subscribe to Apple News+,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get premium sports coverage from many local newspapers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sports. Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: iOS and the entire Apple ecosystem are amazing for families,</p>
<p>and we have some great new features to talk about,</p>
<p>starting with some updates to Family Sharing.</p>
<p>With Family Sharing, you can share your favorite purchases</p>
<p>and subscriptions with up to five of your family members,</p>
<p>including Apple Music, iCloud+, Apple One, and much more.</p>
<p>Everyone gets personalized access to their favorite content</p>
<p>without having to buy their own subscriptions or share an account.</p>
<p>And for households with kids, you can create accounts just for them</p>
<p>with built-in parental controls to help you monitor their screen time</p>
<p>or approve their purchases.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re making it even easier to create accounts for kids</p>
<p>and make sure the right parental controls are in place right from the start.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding a new, easy way to set age-appropriate restrictions</p>
<p>for apps, movies, books, and music.</p>
<p>Along with quick setup of other important parental controls.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also making setting up a new device for your child‚Äì</p>
<p>like an iPad‚Äìreally simple.</p>
<p>Just turn on the device they&rsquo;ll be using, bring your iPhone nearby,</p>
<p>and choose to set up with Quick Start.</p>
<p>With just a few taps, the new device will be set up for their use</p>
<p>with all the parental controls you&rsquo;ve selected already configured.</p>
<p>And when your child asks for more screen time,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t have to navigate to Settings to approve or deny their request.</p>
<p>You can now respond right in Messages.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ve added a new Family Checklist with helpful tips</p>
<p>like updating a child&rsquo;s settings as they get older,</p>
<p>turning on location sharing,</p>
<p>or just reminding you that you can share your iCloud+ subscription with everyone.</p>
<p>So those are some of the helpful updates to Family Sharing this year.</p>
<p>Now, as we all know, one of the things</p>
<p>everyone enjoys sharing with their family is photos.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;re introducing a better way to share photos with your family.</p>
<p>Our precious memories are often captured by several people</p>
<p>and in between personal photos of hobbies, house projects, and homework,</p>
<p>we have photos on our device that everyone in the family would like to have.</p>
<p>But no one has all of them,</p>
<p>so the family&rsquo;s memories are never complete.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re introducing iCloud Shared Photo Library</p>
<p>to help you share photos seamlessly and even automatically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to set up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a separate iCloud library that everyone can contribute to,</p>
<p>collaborate on, and enjoy.</p>
<p>You can participate in one shared library</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s shared with up to five other people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made it simple to share just the photos you want from your library.</p>
<p>You can share everything already in your library,</p>
<p>or choose what to include based on a start date or the people in the photos.</p>
<p>For example, you can choose to include just the photos</p>
<p>where you were together with your partner and the kids.</p>
<p>Once the Shared Library is set up,</p>
<p>you can manually move over new photos after you take them.</p>
<p>But we wanted to make it even easier with a new switch right in Camera</p>
<p>that sends shots straight to the Shared Library as you take them.</p>
<p>This is great when you&rsquo;re on a vacation and you want to make sure</p>
<p>the photos are shared right away.</p>
<p>And if you take a photo of something personal, like a gift,</p>
<p>you can easily turn it off.</p>
<p>You can also choose to have the sharing switch enabled automatically</p>
<p>whenever you take shots with other members of the Shared Library nearby.</p>
<p>So if you take photos on a camping trip, you don&rsquo;t have to remember</p>
<p>to share them later.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also receive intelligent sharing suggestions in the For You tab.</p>
<p>Everyone has equal permissions for adding, editing,</p>
<p>and deleting photos in the Shared Library.</p>
<p>So if one member of the group is a talented photo editor,</p>
<p>everyone gets to enjoy their edits to the shared photos.</p>
<p>Deletions, captions, and keywords sync too.</p>
<p>Content in the Shared Library will appear in everyone&rsquo;s Memories,</p>
<p>Featured Photos, and in the Photos widget.</p>
<p>So you can relive your family&rsquo;s adventures that include all the photos.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s iCloud Shared Photo Library:</p>
<p>the best way to share photos with your family.</p>
<p>And last, let&rsquo;s talk about privacy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always working hard to protect our users and their privacy,</p>
<p>with features like App Privacy Report, Mail Privacy Protection,</p>
<p>App Tracking Transparency, Privacy Nutrition Labels,</p>
<p>and so many more.</p>
<p>Another critically important area is protecting our users&rsquo; personal safety.</p>
<p>One way we&rsquo;re doing that is by adding a new tool</p>
<p>to help people quickly turn off others&rsquo; access,</p>
<p>for example, disabling location sharing if they&rsquo;re escaping an abusive relationship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Safety Check.</p>
<p>To tell you about it, here&rsquo;s Katie.</p>
<p>Katie Skinner: Many people share passwords</p>
<p>and access to their devices with their partner.</p>
<p>However, in abusive relationships, this can threaten personal safety</p>
<p>and make it harder for victims to get help.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working closely with organizations</p>
<p>that support victims of domestic and intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>And the result of those conversations is Safety Check,</p>
<p>a new section in Settings where you can quickly review and reset the access</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve granted others.</p>
<p>This lets people in abusive situations quickly revoke an abuser&rsquo;s access</p>
<p>to their data and location,</p>
<p>enabling them to cut ties and get to safety.</p>
<p>Safety Check stops sharing your location with others via FindMy</p>
<p>and resets the system privacy permissions for all apps.</p>
<p>It also protects access to your messages by helping you sign out of iCloud</p>
<p>on all your other devices</p>
<p>and restricts Messages and FaceTime to the device in your hand.</p>
<p>Safety Check also helps you manage who you&rsquo;ve given access to.</p>
<p>And you can audit which permissions you&rsquo;ve granted to certain apps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve received some really positive feedback on our approach,</p>
<p>including from the National Center for Victims of Crime</p>
<p>who said: &ldquo;In times of crisis, for many survivors,</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s important to know who has their information and location.</p>
<p>Safety Check helps give control back to survivors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is important work,</p>
<p>expanding the ways iOS helps you stay safe.</p>
<p>Now, back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: Protecting you and your privacy is and will always be</p>
<p>at the center of what we do.</p>
<p>iOS 16 offers so many updates that will change the way you experience iPhone.</p>
<p>iOS also extends that experience beyond the phone,</p>
<p>to enhance how you interact with the world around you.</p>
<p>Whether helping you through your morning routine</p>
<p>or keeping you connected on your next road trip,</p>
<p>iOS has you covered.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re bringing exciting updates to your home and your car.</p>
<p>To tell you what&rsquo;s new in the home, here&rsquo;s Corey.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Corey Wang: Our home is perhaps the most important place in our lives,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot to manage.</p>
<p>Smart home accessories can make it easier</p>
<p>and more convenient to control your home right from your iPhone.</p>
<p>You can do things like see who&rsquo;s at the door while working at your desk,</p>
<p>or turn off the lights downstairs without getting out of bed.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re away from home,</p>
<p>you can double-check if the front door is locked</p>
<p>or adjust the temperature so it&rsquo;s just right when you get back.</p>
<p>And your smart home is all the more powerful</p>
<p>when your accessories work together, reacting to changes automatically.</p>
<p>Now, the smart home is still in its early days,</p>
<p>and we want to help bring these powerful experiences</p>
<p>to as many homes as possible.</p>
<p>In order to build a connected ecosystem at home,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that you have the most choice</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about what works with what.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we joined forces with other industry leaders</p>
<p>to create a new smart home connectivity standard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Matter.</p>
<p>Matter enables smart home accessories to work together across platforms.</p>
<p>And to ensure we stayed true to our values,</p>
<p>we contributed HomeKit, our smart home framework,</p>
<p>as a foundation of this new standard,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s built on the same core principles</p>
<p>and maintains the highest level of security.</p>
<p>Industry-leading brands have already committed to supporting Matter,</p>
<p>with over 130 products in the pipeline, and that&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>The Matter standard provides the underlying foundation</p>
<p>to connect smart home accessories, and it allows us to innovate on top of it.</p>
<p>We take privacy further,</p>
<p>ensuring that data about how you use your accessories is processed</p>
<p>and stored by default in a way that even Apple can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>With Matter, we can continue to create amazing experiences in the Home app</p>
<p>while also making sure all your different accessories</p>
<p>are consistently simple to set up and easy to use.</p>
<p>And now that you‚Äôll have more accessory options to choose from,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s check out how we made the experience even better</p>
<p>with an all-new Home app.</p>
<p>We reimagined it from the ground up starting with the underlying architecture</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s more efficient and reliable,</p>
<p>especially for homes with many accessories.</p>
<p>We also completely redesigned how you navigate, organize,</p>
<p>and view accessories to make it easier to control your smart home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve integrated your rooms and favorites into the main tab of the app.</p>
<p>So you can see your entire home in a single view.</p>
<p>And we made sure it looks great, whether you&rsquo;re just getting started</p>
<p>or have built out an advanced connected home.</p>
<p>We added new categories for climate, lights, security, and more</p>
<p>and an overview of what&rsquo;s happening in each category</p>
<p>right at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>And categories are a great way to navigate within the app.</p>
<p>When you tap on a specific category, you see all the relevant accessories</p>
<p>organized by room and more detailed status information.</p>
<p>A multi-camera view displays up to four cameras at once front and center,</p>
<p>and you can scroll to the right to see any additional cameras.</p>
<p>We also redesigned tiles so that different accessories</p>
<p>are more visually recognizable through shape and color.</p>
<p>And with the new widgets on the Lock Screen, it&rsquo;s easier than ever</p>
<p>to see how your home is doing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the all-new Home app, and it&rsquo;s coming to iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p>Now that you have what you need to keep tabs on your home,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ready to hit the road.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hand it off to Emily to talk about CarPlay.</p>
<p>Emily Schubert: CarPlay is the smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car</p>
<p>and has fundamentally changed the way people interact with their vehicles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available on over 98% of cars in the U.S.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, 79% of U.S. buyers</p>
<p>would only consider a car that works with CarPlay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a must-have feature when shopping for a new vehicle.</p>
<p>Our users love CarPlay.</p>
<p>It gives them an easy way to use apps in the car,</p>
<p>using the familiar UI from their iPhone.</p>
<p>But cars have changed a lot,</p>
<p>with larger-sized screens and more of them throughout the car.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an opportunity for iPhone to play an even more important role.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working with automakers to reinvent the in-car experience</p>
<p>across all of the driver&rsquo;s screens.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a sneak peek at this next generation of CarPlay.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to explore here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>
<p>This next generation of CarPlay provides content for all the driver&rsquo;s screens,</p>
<p>giving an experience that is unified and consistent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the very best of both your car and your iPhone.</p>
<p>And it goes beyond what you can do with CarPlay today.</p>
<p>Deep integration with the car&rsquo;s hardware lets you tune your car&rsquo;s radio</p>
<p>or change your temperature without ever leaving the CarPlay experience.</p>
<p>It also includes widgets, powered by your iPhone,</p>
<p>that fit your screens perfectly.</p>
<p>They can live front and center in the gauge cluster as well,</p>
<p>giving you information at a glance.</p>
<p>In fact, this next generation of CarPlay powers your entire instrument cluster.</p>
<p>To do this, your iPhone communicates</p>
<p>with your vehicle&rsquo;s real-time systems</p>
<p>in an on-device, privacy-friendly way,</p>
<p>showing all of your driving information like speed, RPMs,</p>
<p>fuel level, temperature, and more.</p>
<p>And no matter what type of unique screen shapes or layouts you may have,</p>
<p>this next generation of CarPlay feels like</p>
<p>it was made specifically for your car.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also excited to give you the ability</p>
<p>to make the core of the driving experience unique to you.</p>
<p>We carefully crafted instrument cluster options</p>
<p>ranging from the modern to the traditional,</p>
<p>that use different colors,</p>
<p>dial treatments, backgrounds, and layouts</p>
<p>to provide various looks and feels.</p>
<p>You can choose different curated themes and styles for your gauges.</p>
<p>And automakers from around the world are excited</p>
<p>to bring this new vision of CarPlay to customers.</p>
<p>This is just a taste of what the next generation of CarPlay will bring.</p>
<p>Vehicles will start to be announced late next year,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait to show you more further down the road.</p>
<p>And now, I&rsquo;ll hand it back to Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: And that&rsquo;s iOS 16,</p>
<p>a mighty release that gives you entirely new ways to make iOS your own.</p>
<p>It also helps you stay in touch with ease, engage with the world around you,</p>
<p>and seamlessly share experiences and memories with your family and friends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made a big advancement in Spatial Audio with AirPods.</p>
<p>Now, Spatial Audio works by understanding how sound interacts</p>
<p>with the geometry of your head and ears.</p>
<p>And now, in iOS 16, you can use the True Depth camera on iPhone</p>
<p>to create a personalized Spatial Audio profile,</p>
<p>enabling an even more precise</p>
<p>and immersive listening experience, tuned just for you.</p>
<p>Plus, Quick Note is coming to iOS so you can capture ideas instantly.</p>
<p>A new rapid security response mechanism</p>
<p>gets important improvements to iPhone faster,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got more Memoji customizations to choose from.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many more features to meet your needs no matter where you are.</p>
<p>Now, I‚Äôll hand it over to Kevin</p>
<p>to tell you about the big new advancements coming to Apple Watch.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Kevin Lynch: Let&rsquo;s talk about watchOS.</p>
<p>Apple Watch continues to be the most loved watch in the world,</p>
<p>because it helps you stay connected, active, and healthy.</p>
<p>In watchOS 9 we&rsquo;re bringing great new features to each of these three areas.</p>
<p>First, you can stay connected to what matters to you most</p>
<p>just by glancing at your wrist,</p>
<p>whether you use the popular Photos watch face,</p>
<p>or a face with rich complications.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re adding four new watch faces for you to choose from.</p>
<p>The Astronomy face has been remastered to take advantage of the expansive display,</p>
<p>and shows current cloud coverage around the world.</p>
<p>The Lunar calendar is used to observe traditional holidays</p>
<p>and special events in many cultures.</p>
<p>The Lunar watch face celebrates this thousand-year-old practice</p>
<p>with support for Chinese, Islamic, and Hebrew calendars.</p>
<p>Play Time, designed by artist Joi Fulton,</p>
<p>features whimsical animated numbers.</p>
<p>You can tap the display to send them bouncing around,</p>
<p>and when you lower your wrist, they take a nap.</p>
<p>Finally, Metropolitan highlights watch typography with a new font</p>
<p>that dynamically stretches when you rotate the digital crown,</p>
<p>and features many lovely color combinations.</p>
<p>Rich complications enable you to see more information in a small space,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re bringing these to more of our watch faces.</p>
<p>watchOS 9 also introduces a refreshed Siri UI and new banner notifications.</p>
<p>And active apps will be pinned to the top of the Dock for quick access.</p>
<p>Another way to stay connected is by listening to the latest stories,</p>
<p>or sharing your favorite content.</p>
<p>With watchOS 9, the Podcast app allows you to discover</p>
<p>and follow new podcasts using Search and Listen Now.</p>
<p>And the app is now available to kids using Family Setup.</p>
<p>For developers, sharing content and selected images from apps like Outcast</p>
<p>and WeChat is easier with the new Share Sheet and Photos Picker APIs.</p>
<p>And with CallKit, you can start, end, or mute VoIP calls from apps</p>
<p>like Webex directly on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some of what&rsquo;s coming in watchOS 9 to keep you connected.</p>
<p>And now to Craig to tell you what&rsquo;s coming to keep you active.</p>
<p>Craig Bolton: The Workout app is one of the most popular apps,</p>
<p>so in watchOS 9, we&rsquo;re bringing new easy-to-use metrics,</p>
<p>views, and training experiences inspired by high-performing athletes,</p>
<p>starting with running.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sport that, no matter what your level,</p>
<p>you can use metrics to better understand your performance.</p>
<p>And switching up your training can reduce the chance of getting injured.</p>
<p>The first thing we&rsquo;re doing is adding three new running form metrics</p>
<p>to track how efficiently you run.</p>
<p>Measuring these from the wrist isn&rsquo;t easy.</p>
<p>Take vertical oscillation for example,</p>
<p>which is a measure of how much you move up and down.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too high, your energy might be wasted going up</p>
<p>versus propelling you forward.</p>
<p>In order to capture this from the wrist,</p>
<p>we need to extrapolate your torso movement</p>
<p>from the distinctive style of your arm swing.</p>
<p>We use machine learning and sensor fusion‚Äì</p>
<p>a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope‚Äì</p>
<p>to isolate your torso movement,</p>
<p>and then measure how much vertical oscillation is produced.</p>
<p>We use a similar approach to measure the two other Running Form metrics‚Äì</p>
<p>stride length and ground contact time.</p>
<p>These metrics can be added to new easy-to-read Workout views.</p>
<p>Each Workout view lets you see more at a glance.</p>
<p>Scroll the digital crown to see new views</p>
<p>for familiar metrics like segments,</p>
<p>splits, and elevation.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re introducing heart rate zones</p>
<p>so you can quickly see what zone you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and get a sense of your intensity level at any point during your workout.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a new custom workout</p>
<p>that you can use to add structure into your run.</p>
<p>For example, if you are trying to improve your speed or endurance,</p>
<p>you can create a workout using distance and time intervals</p>
<p>that include sets of work and recovery which you can repeat as needed.</p>
<p>You can also add one of the new alerts to a specific part of your workout‚Äì</p>
<p>like one to monitor which heart rate zone you want to train in</p>
<p>to help keep you on track.</p>
<p>During your run, these alerts will guide you</p>
<p>with both haptics and voice feedback,</p>
<p>letting you know when to switch between work and recovery</p>
<p>and when to pick up the pace if your heart rate falls below</p>
<p>the target zone that you set.</p>
<p>During your run, you can use the Digital Crown</p>
<p>for additional workout views like this new power metric.</p>
<p>Running with a power target can help you go the distance</p>
<p>by keeping your effort in a range that you can reasonably sustain.</p>
<p>You can even see how this workout is contributing to your Activity rings.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a route you do often, it will be automatically saved</p>
<p>in the Workout app for you to race against your last or best time.</p>
<p>That way, you can see if all the training you&rsquo;re doing is paying off.</p>
<p>You can use many of these new features not just when you&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>but for many workout types like Hiking,</p>
<p>HIIT, and Functional Strength Training.</p>
<p>And for our triathletes, there&rsquo;s a new multi-sport workout type</p>
<p>that uses sensor fusion to detect when you finish one leg of your race</p>
<p>and are transitioning to the next.</p>
<p>So it can automatically switch between swimming, cycling, and running.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just some of what&rsquo;s coming to the Workout app in watchOS 9.</p>
<p>Since the first Apple Watch, we&rsquo;ve been inspired by the stories</p>
<p>we hear from users who stay motivated by closing their Activity rings each day.</p>
<p>We also know there are many iPhone users who want to meet</p>
<p>their fitness goals but don&rsquo;t yet have an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>So in iOS 16, the Fitness app will be available to all iPhone users.</p>
<p>Using the iPhone motion sensors,</p>
<p>you can track steps, distance,</p>
<p>flights climbed, and workouts from your favorite apps,</p>
<p>which can be converted to an estimation of your active calories</p>
<p>to contribute to your daily Move goal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also be able to share your Move ring with friends</p>
<p>and receive coaching tips.</p>
<p>While Apple Watch gives you a picture of your all-day activity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re excited to bring some of the Fitness app benefits to iPhone users</p>
<p>to get them started on their fitness journey.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll hand it off to Sumbul to tell you what&rsquo;s coming in watchOS 9</p>
<p>to help keep you healthy.</p>
<p>Sumbul Ahmad Desai: The Sleep app has helped millions of you</p>
<p>by providing insights into how much sleep you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>along with metrics like heart rate,</p>
<p>respiratory rate, and blood oxygen.</p>
<p>In watchOS 9, you&rsquo;ll be able to learn more about your sleep with Sleep Stages.</p>
<p>Apple Watch uses signals from the accelerometer and heart rate sensor</p>
<p>to detect which stage of sleep you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Machine learning models were trained and validated</p>
<p>against the clinical gold standard of polysomnography with the largest</p>
<p>and most diverse population ever studied for a wearable.</p>
<p>You can see how much time you spent in each stage,</p>
<p>as well as when you might have woken up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see more details in the Health app where you&rsquo;ll learn</p>
<p>that each sleep stage‚Äì REM, Core, and Deep‚Äì</p>
<p>perform an essential function.</p>
<p>And as you sleep, you&rsquo;re likely to cycle through these stages multiple times.</p>
<p>Researchers are still looking into what happens during sleep</p>
<p>and how it impacts your health.</p>
<p>We want to help push forward the science of sleep,</p>
<p>so Apple Heart and Movement Study participants will now be able</p>
<p>to contribute sleep stage data through the Research app.</p>
<p>With the large scale of this study, we are excited about the potential discoveries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new with sleep.</p>
<p>Another area where Apple Watch has an impact is heart health.</p>
<p>We hear from so many of you who have received an Atrial Fibrillation alert</p>
<p>and sought potentially-life saving care.</p>
<p>So we also wanted to offer support once you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed.</p>
<p>When living with this condition, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>the time you spend in AFib because it may relate</p>
<p>to your risk of serious complications, such as stroke.</p>
<p>watchOS 9 can now track the amount of time</p>
<p>your heart shows signs of this rhythm with AFib History.</p>
<p>And in the Health app, you can manage lifestyle factors</p>
<p>that may influence the amount of time you spend in AFib</p>
<p>like exercise, sleep, and weight.</p>
<p>AFib History even helps you identify the time of the day or week</p>
<p>when your AFib is most frequent.</p>
<p>You can also share a PDF with your doctor to facilitate richer conversations.</p>
<p>AFib History is a first-of-its-kind feature</p>
<p>that uniquely provides insights into your AFib over the long term.</p>
<p>We expect to receive FDA clearance for AFib History soon.</p>
<p>Apple Watch makes some of the more complicated aspects</p>
<p>of your health more intuitive.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re tackling another integral aspect of health</p>
<p>for so many of us‚ÄìMedications.</p>
<p>Over 50% of people take prescription medications,</p>
<p>and we wanted to help make it easier to track, manage,</p>
<p>and understand the medications that you take.</p>
<p>So in watchOS 9, the Medications app makes it easy for you to discreetly</p>
<p>and conveniently track your medications,</p>
<p>vitamins, and supplements anytime.</p>
<p>You can log medications that you might take occasionally</p>
<p>like Cetirizine for allergies.</p>
<p>And you can receive notifications for medications</p>
<p>that you need to take regularly.</p>
<p>Rich complications on your watch face can help you stay on top of your schedule.</p>
<p>And of course you can track and manage your medications in the Health app,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>To build your medications list,</p>
<p>start typing the name, and you&rsquo;ll see suggestions.</p>
<p>We wanted to make creating the list easier,</p>
<p>especially if you take multiple medications.</p>
<p>So you can just use your iPhone camera to scan the label of your medication.</p>
<p>You can create a schedule to receive reminders</p>
<p>and add custom visuals to make it easier to remember.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of medications is drug-drug interactions,</p>
<p>which can make them less effective or cause side effects.</p>
<p>In the U.S. alone, drug interactions cause nearly</p>
<p>a quarter of a million hospitalizations each year.</p>
<p>To help you with this, you&rsquo;ll receive an alert when you add a new medication</p>
<p>if there is a critical interaction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve partnered with Elsevier, a leading medical publisher,</p>
<p>to provide clinically accurate and evidence-based information</p>
<p>across the Medications experience.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to review critical, serious, and moderate interactions</p>
<p>as well as interaction factors like alcohol.</p>
<p>Medications also works with Health Sharing,</p>
<p>which is updated in iOS 16.</p>
<p>You can now send a family member an invitation</p>
<p>to share their health data with you.</p>
<p>This is another way that you can support a loved one on their health journey</p>
<p>and have peace of mind, too.</p>
<p>Now back to Kevin.</p>
<p>Kevin: Your health data is some of your most personal information,</p>
<p>and privacy is central to how we build and design features for Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Health data is encrypted on device</p>
<p>and is not shared without your explicit permission.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also now be periodically reminded of what health data you&rsquo;re sharing</p>
<p>and who you&rsquo;re sharing it with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more in watchOS 9,</p>
<p>including support for six new keyboard languages,</p>
<p>a new way for developers to connect their watchOS apps to Apple TV,</p>
<p>and with Family Setup, kids can now control home devices</p>
<p>right from their wrist.</p>
<p>watchOS is the world&rsquo;s most advanced wearable operating system,</p>
<p>and watchOS 9 takes it further</p>
<p>with new features to help you stay connected,</p>
<p>active, and healthy.</p>
<p>Back to Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: I&rsquo;m so excited for watchOS 9</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t wait to get it into the hands of our users.</p>
<p>Next, to show you what&rsquo;s new with Mac, here&rsquo;s John.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>John Ternus: We couldn&rsquo;t be more excited</p>
<p>by how well the Mac transition to Apple Silicon is going.</p>
<p>It all started with the launch of M1, which brought a whole new level</p>
<p>of performance, capabilities, and battery life to the Mac.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already transitioned nearly the entire Mac product line.</p>
<p>Users have been blown away by the phenomenal capabilities</p>
<p>of these new systems powered by the M1 family of chips.</p>
<p>And the Mac business has never been stronger.</p>
<p>Well, today we&rsquo;re excited to start the next generation</p>
<p>of Apple Silicon for the Mac.</p>
<p>Introducing&hellip;</p>
<p>M2.</p>
<p>It takes the breakthrough performance and capabilities of M1 even further.</p>
<p>To tell you more, I&rsquo;ll pass it over to Johny.</p>
<p>Johny Srouji: Today we begin our second generation of Apple Silicon</p>
<p>designed specifically for the Mac.</p>
<p>The M-Series chips deliver a scalable range of performance and capabilities.</p>
<p>It began with M1&rsquo;s breakthrough set of features</p>
<p>that transformed our most popular systems.</p>
<p>M2 starts the second generation of M-Series chips,</p>
<p>and goes beyond the remarkable features of M1.</p>
<p>Unlike others in the industry who significantly increase power</p>
<p>to gain performance, our approach is different.</p>
<p>We continue to have a relentless focus on power efficient performance.</p>
<p>In other words, maximizing performance while minimizing power consumption.</p>
<p>Combined with our unified memory architecture and custom technologies,</p>
<p>this focus on power efficiency allows M2 to bring even more performance</p>
<p>and new capabilities to our most popular Macs.</p>
<p>M2 is built using an enhanced,</p>
<p>second-generation five nanometer technology,</p>
<p>and features over 20 billion transistors:</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 25% more than M1.</p>
<p>We use those transistors to enhance every feature of the chip,</p>
<p>starting with the memory controller</p>
<p>which delivers 100GB/s of unified memory bandwidth,</p>
<p>which is 50% more than M1 for even greater performance.</p>
<p>And because M1 is so capable, users run all sorts of demanding tasks.</p>
<p>So for M2, we&rsquo;ve enabled up to 24GB of unified memory</p>
<p>to handle even larger and more complex workloads.</p>
<p>M2 features our next-generation CPU,</p>
<p>with advancements in both the performance and efficiency cores.</p>
<p>The performance cores are faster and feature a larger cache,</p>
<p>and the efficiency cores have been significantly enhanced</p>
<p>for even greater performance gains.</p>
<p>Together, they rip through CPU-intensive tasks using very little power.</p>
<p>When we look at the multi-core CPU performance of M2 compared to M1,</p>
<p>it delivers 18% greater performance.</p>
<p>And compared to the latest 10-core PC laptop chip,</p>
<p>the CPU in M2 delivers nearly two times faster performance</p>
<p>at the same power level.</p>
<p>And M2 delivers the peak performance of the PC chip</p>
<p>while using a quarter of the power.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s compare M2 to the latest 12-core PC laptop chip,</p>
<p>which needs dramatically more power</p>
<p>to deliver an increase in performance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in a thicker, hotter, more noisy system</p>
<p>with less battery life.</p>
<p>M2 delivers nearly 90% of the peak performance of the 12-core chip</p>
<p>while using just a quarter of the power.</p>
<p>This is what we mean by the power efficient performance</p>
<p>of Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>M2 also features our next generation GPU,</p>
<p>which now has up to 10 cores‚Äì that&rsquo;s two more than M1.</p>
<p>Combined with a larger cache and higher memory bandwidth,</p>
<p>the 10-core GPU delivers a big boost in graphics performance.</p>
<p>M2 delivers up to 25% higher graphics performance</p>
<p>at the same power level as M1</p>
<p>and up to 35% higher performance at its max.</p>
<p>And compared to the integrated graphics in the latest PC laptop chip,</p>
<p>the GPU in M2 delivers 2.3 times faster performance at the same power level.</p>
<p>And M2 delivers the peak performance of the PC chip</p>
<p>using just one-fifth of the power.</p>
<p>This much higher performance per watt from M2</p>
<p>enables systems to run cool and quiet with exceptional battery life.</p>
<p>Now, one of the advantages of making our own silicon</p>
<p>is that we can quickly bring our newest custom technologies</p>
<p>across our SoCs.</p>
<p>So M2 also features our next-generation Secure Enclave and Neural Engine.</p>
<p>The Neural Engine in M2 can process up to 15.8 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s over 40% more than M1.</p>
<p>It also has our next generation media engine,</p>
<p>including a higher-bandwidth video decoder</p>
<p>that supports 8K H.264 and HEVC video.</p>
<p>And M2 features our powerful ProRes video engine</p>
<p>for hardware accelerated encode and decode.</p>
<p>So systems with M2 will be able to play back multiple streams of 4K and 8K video.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s M2.</p>
<p>It starts our next generation of M-Series chips, with an 18% faster CPU,</p>
<p>35% faster GPU,</p>
<p>40% faster Neural Engine,</p>
<p>and 50% more memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>It takes the amazing performance, capabilities,</p>
<p>and efficiency of M1 even further.</p>
<p>Now, back to John.</p>
<p>John: The fact that we&rsquo;re already starting our next generation of Apple Silicon</p>
<p>for the Mac is remarkable.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about the first Mac to get the M2 chip.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thrilled that it&rsquo;s our most loved Mac‚Äì</p>
<p>the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Users love MacBook Air for its great performance,</p>
<p>portability, and battery life.</p>
<p>It defined the category of thin and light notebooks.</p>
<p>And with M1, it redefined what a thin and light notebook could do.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s more popular than ever.</p>
<p>In fact, MacBook Air is the world&rsquo;s best-selling laptop.</p>
<p>Apple Silicon enables us to design products we never could have imagined,</p>
<p>which is why we&rsquo;re so excited to introduce an all-new MacBook Air,</p>
<p>completely redesigned around M2.</p>
<p>And here it is.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>John: This is the new MacBook Air, powered by M2.</p>
<p>And to tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Kristin.</p>
<p>Kristin White: The new MacBook Air takes everything our users love about the Air</p>
<p>to the next level.</p>
<p>The wedge shape of the previous Air has evolved into a new design</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s strikingly thin from every angle.</p>
<p>The durable, all-aluminum unibody enclosure</p>
<p>feels incredibly solid when you hold it and is built to last.</p>
<p>And this remarkably thin design integrates its components so efficiently</p>
<p>that it results in an astonishing 20% reduction in volume over the previous Air.</p>
<p>The new Air is just 11.3mm thin,</p>
<p>or under half an inch, and it&rsquo;s only 2.7 pounds.</p>
<p>MacBook Air now comes in four finishes:</p>
<p>Silver, Space Gray,</p>
<p>a gorgeous Starlight, and a stunning Midnight.</p>
<p>And yes, MagSafe is back for dedicated charging</p>
<p>and peace of mind when you&rsquo;re plugged in.</p>
<p>And it keeps the two Thunderbolt ports free</p>
<p>for connecting to a variety of accessories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an audio jack with support for high-impedance headphones.</p>
<p>This all-new design is incredibly portable,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s loaded with new features,</p>
<p>starting with a brilliant Liquid Retina display.</p>
<p>We expanded the display closer to the sides and up around the camera</p>
<p>to make room for the menu bar.</p>
<p>The result is a larger 13.6-inch display with much thinner borders,</p>
<p>giving users more screen real estate to view their content in brilliant detail.</p>
<p>At 500 nits, it&rsquo;s also 25% brighter than before.</p>
<p>And MacBook Air now supports 1 billion colors,</p>
<p>so photos and movies look incredibly vibrant.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about the camera.</p>
<p>Having a great camera is more important than ever these days.</p>
<p>So MacBook Air features a new 1080p camera with twice the resolution</p>
<p>and twice the low-light performance of the previous Air.</p>
<p>Combined with the processing power of M2&rsquo;s advanced image signal processor,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll look great on video calls.</p>
<p>Next up, audio.</p>
<p>To fit inside such a thin design, the speakers and mics</p>
<p>are completely integrated between the keyboard and display,</p>
<p>all while delivering an even better audio experience.</p>
<p>A three-mic array captures clean audio using advanced beam-forming algorithms.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a four-speaker sound system</p>
<p>that produces amazing stereo separation and vocal clarity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also support for immersive Spatial Audio</p>
<p>for music and movies with Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>The Magic Keyboard features a full-height function row with Touch ID.</p>
<p>And, of course, the new Air has a spacious,</p>
<p>industry-leading Force Touch trackpad.</p>
<p>And when it comes to performance, M2 takes it even further.</p>
<p>So applying filters and effects in apps like Photoshop</p>
<p>is up to 20% faster than before</p>
<p>and a massive five times faster</p>
<p>for customers that haven&rsquo;t yet upgraded to Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>And for intensive workloads like editing complex timelines in Final Cut Pro,</p>
<p>performance is nearly 40% faster than the previous Air.</p>
<p>Thanks to the power efficiency of M2,</p>
<p>all these capabilities are built into a silent, fan-less design.</p>
<p>And even with a larger display and increased performance,</p>
<p>the Air delivers the same great all-day battery life</p>
<p>with up to 18 hours of video playback.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some new charging options,</p>
<p>including a compact power adapter with two USB-C ports</p>
<p>so you can charge two devices at once.</p>
<p>And for the first time,</p>
<p>the Air supports fast charge with an available 67W adapter.</p>
<p>So you can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the all-new, amazingly portable and powerful MacBook Air.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thinner, lighter, and faster</p>
<p>with a durable unibody design, bigger display,</p>
<p>better camera, all-day battery life, and four beautiful finishes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything you could want in a new MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Now, before I hand it back to John, let&rsquo;s see it in action.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>John: We&rsquo;re so excited to bring M2 to MacBook Air,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s best-selling laptop.</p>
<p>Only with Apple Silicon can you build such a thin and light notebook</p>
<p>with a fan-less design</p>
<p>and this combination of performance and capabilities.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all we have for you today.</p>
<p>M2 is coming to another Mac,</p>
<p>which is actually the world&rsquo;s second-best-selling laptop:</p>
<p>the 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our most portable pro notebook,</p>
<p>and users love the performance it delivers in its compact design.</p>
<p>Now with M2, you get even more capabilities</p>
<p>in the same great form factor.</p>
<p>With a faster 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU,</p>
<p>working with RAW images in apps like Affinity Photo</p>
<p>is nearly 40% faster than the previous generation.</p>
<p>And over three times faster</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re upgrading from a model without Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>And playing graphics intensive games like Baldur&rsquo;s Gate III</p>
<p>is also nearly 40% faster than the previous 13-inch Pro.</p>
<p>With an active cooling system, the MacBook Pro is designed</p>
<p>to sustain its pro performance.</p>
<p>And thanks to M2, it also supports up to 24GB of unified memory.</p>
<p>Along with 50% more memory bandwidth,</p>
<p>multitasking and working with large assets is super fluid.</p>
<p>With support for ProRes encode and decode in M2&rsquo;s media engine,</p>
<p>you can convert your video projects to ProRes</p>
<p>nearly three times faster than before.</p>
<p>MacBook Pro also delivers phenomenal battery life,</p>
<p>with up to 20 hours of video playback.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the powerful 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>With the incredible performance of M2, ProRes acceleration,</p>
<p>up to 24GB of memory, and up to 20 hours of battery life,</p>
<p>our most portable Pro notebook gets even better.</p>
<p>Both the Air and the Pro also support our environmental goals.</p>
<p>They use 100% recycled rare earth elements in many components,</p>
<p>are free of numerous harmful substances,</p>
<p>and meet Apple&rsquo;s high standards for energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The all-new MacBook Air starts at $1199</p>
<p>and just $1099 for education.</p>
<p>The powerful 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1299</p>
<p>and $1199 for education.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be available next month.</p>
<p>And the MacBook Air with M1 stays in the lineup at $999</p>
<p>and just $899 for education.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thrilled to bring M2 to the world&rsquo;s two most popular laptops,</p>
<p>the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>And they join the even more powerful 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro</p>
<p>with M1 Pro and M1 Max</p>
<p>to round out the most amazing lineup of Macs we&rsquo;ve ever offered,</p>
<p>and continue our tremendous pace of innovation for the Mac.</p>
<p>Now, back to Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: We&rsquo;re really excited about these new Macs</p>
<p>with the next generation of Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>And the powerful software that drives the experience is macOS.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>Kyle: Jump! Sit!</p>
<p>Craig?</p>
<p>Craig: Sorry, Kyle. Wrong door.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>macOS plays a critical role in our lives</p>
<p>as we work, collaborate with colleagues, family, and friends,</p>
<p>create and organize what&rsquo;s important to us,</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>This year, we focused on making the core things you do with macOS even better,</p>
<p>delivering new ways to be productive and take advantage</p>
<p>of the capability of your other devices with Continuity.</p>
<p>So what should we call it?</p>
<p>Well, that brings us to the latest exploits</p>
<p>of Apple&rsquo;s crack product marketing team.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been absolutely riding high since their naming coup on M1 and M2,</p>
<p>and needless to say, they were exhausted.</p>
<p>But after their requisite three-month rejuvenation retreat in Monterey,</p>
<p>with their chakras now in complete alignment,</p>
<p>the team once again piled into their macOS naming microbus</p>
<p>and wove their way down Highway 1.</p>
<p>Chasing the vibrant display of colorful California wildflowers,</p>
<p>they finally came to rest</p>
<p>where stunning surf meets lush alluvial plains,</p>
<p>in beautiful Ventura.</p>
<p>macOS Ventura enriches so many of the ways we use our Macs.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>
<p>A key part of the Mac experience is helping you be productive and creative,</p>
<p>which can often mean having a lot of windows open at once.</p>
<p>And the more you do, the more overwhelming this can become.</p>
<p>We all want the perfect mix‚Äì</p>
<p>to focus on our work without distractions</p>
<p>and to easily move between tasks.</p>
<p>This year, we have a new way to automatically keep everything organized</p>
<p>and give you quick access to your windows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Stage Manager.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it works.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re working on the Mac, it&rsquo;s really easy</p>
<p>to find yourself with lots of open windows.</p>
<p>Now, the Mac has great tools like Mission Control</p>
<p>to help you find the window that you&rsquo;re looking for,</p>
<p>but with so many open windows,</p>
<p>it can feel like you never really escape all the clutter.</p>
<p>With Stage Manager, you can focus on the app you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>without the distractions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easy to get started.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s activate Stage Manager from Control Center.</p>
<p>As you see, it automatically arranges all my windows for me off to the side</p>
<p>and puts the app I&rsquo;m currently working with front and center.</p>
<p>When I bring forward a different app,</p>
<p>like clicking on Mail here in the Dock,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s brought to the stage</p>
<p>and Safari gracefully moves over to the left</p>
<p>with my other recent apps.</p>
<p>When I click on Safari, it retakes the stage,</p>
<p>and Mail moves back to the left.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that for an app with multiple open windows,</p>
<p>like Pages here, Stage Manager gathers all the windows together</p>
<p>in a single pile.</p>
<p>When I click, I get the top one,</p>
<p>and if I want a different window, I can cycle through them</p>
<p>just by clicking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really convenient.</p>
<p>Of course, just as you would expect on a Mac,</p>
<p>I can have overlapping windows and multiple apps open at the same time too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to group apps together.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;ll just drag in Notes and pair it with my Pages window.</p>
<p>This is so great when I&rsquo;m working on projects</p>
<p>that involve a specific group of windows</p>
<p>like planning a trip with these three apps here.</p>
<p>And if I go back to my previous group,</p>
<p>Stage Manager keeps my windows arranged</p>
<p>just as I left them.</p>
<p>I love working this way.</p>
<p>Of course, like many Mac users,</p>
<p>I often want to get at files on my desktop,</p>
<p>and with Stage Manager, we&rsquo;ve made that easier than ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on this Final Cut project,</p>
<p>and I want to pull in a couple of files.</p>
<p>With just a click on my desktop, my windows clear the stage</p>
<p>and my files are revealed.</p>
<p>Now I can grab these title graphics</p>
<p>and drag them over to my Final Cut window.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just drop them in right here,</p>
<p>and boom.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a quick look at multitasking with Stage Manager,</p>
<p>Another part of the Mac experience that helps you do more is Spotlight.</p>
<p>This year we have a big update that delivers a more consistent</p>
<p>and powerful experience across our platforms.</p>
<p>Spotlight is great for doing all kinds of things,</p>
<p>like quickly launching an app or starting a search.</p>
<p>And now you can peek at a result in Quick Look</p>
<p>with a tap on the space bar.</p>
<p>Spotlight can now also find images from your photo library,</p>
<p>across the system, and on the web.</p>
<p>And using Live Text, you can search the text inside the image.</p>
<p>You can also take actions like starting a timer</p>
<p>or running a shortcut right from Spotlight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a great way to get information,</p>
<p>now leveraging the full window for richer results.</p>
<p>For musicians, you&rsquo;ll see their albums, key facts, news, and more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also great for movies, TV shows, and actors,</p>
<p>businesses, and sports.</p>
<p>Rich results and the ability to take actions right from Spotlight</p>
<p>are also coming to iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of iOS, we wanted to make Spotlight even easier</p>
<p>to discover and access,</p>
<p>so we added it right to the bottom of the Home Screen.</p>
<p>With just a tap, you can use Spotlight to launch an app,</p>
<p>find a contact, or start a search.</p>
<p>These updates make Spotlight more productive,</p>
<p>helping you find what you&rsquo;re looking for faster.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s turn to an app that many of us use to communicate every day.</p>
<p>To take you through it, here&rsquo;s Darin.</p>
<p>Darin Adler: Of course, we&rsquo;re talking about Mail.</p>
<p>Mail is central to how so many of us communicate.</p>
<p>This year, we have great updates that will help you be more productive,</p>
<p>starting with some highly-requested features.</p>
<p>Undo send lets you pull an email back a few moments after hitting Send.</p>
<p>Scheduled send, so your emails arrive at the perfect moment.</p>
<p>Follow-up suggestions will automatically remind you to follow up</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t received a response.</p>
<p>And Remind Me makes it easy to come back to a message</p>
<p>at a particular date and time.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk Search.</p>
<p>This is the biggest overhaul of Search in Mail we&rsquo;ve done in years,</p>
<p>leveraging the latest state-of-the-art techniques</p>
<p>to deliver more accurate and complete results.</p>
<p>When you click Search, you&rsquo;ll see recently shared documents,</p>
<p>links, and more.</p>
<p>The moment you start typing,</p>
<p>with each letter, you instantly see suggestions.</p>
<p>If you make a typo, Search is one step ahead,</p>
<p>only showing results for the correct spelling.</p>
<p>And if Search knows a synonym, it&rsquo;ll look for that too.</p>
<p>And all these new features are also coming to iPadOS and iOS.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Mail.</p>
<p>Next up is another app most of us spend a ton of time in every day:</p>
<p>Safari.</p>
<p>With macOS Ventura, Safari is the world&rsquo;s fastest browser,</p>
<p>rendering the most complex websites with incredible speed.</p>
<p>Safari is the most power-efficient browser on Mac,</p>
<p>letting you do more on a single charge than any other browser.</p>
<p>And of course, Safari is a trailblazer in protecting your privacy on the web,</p>
<p>with features like Intelligent Tracking Protection</p>
<p>and Privacy Report.</p>
<p>Safari has a legacy of introducing key web technologies</p>
<p>that elevate the web experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Safari&rsquo;s pioneering support for HTML5 transformed the video experience</p>
<p>on the web, resulting in higher-quality playback and increased battery life.</p>
<p>And Safari continues to deliver support for the latest web technologies</p>
<p>and standards for web developers,</p>
<p>including all of these added in just the last year,</p>
<p>like more fluid web animations, new browser extension types,</p>
<p>and support for the push notifications standards.</p>
<p>These enable more immersive and engaging web content for our users.</p>
<p>And now Safari has a new way to share your favorite content with others</p>
<p>with Shared Tab Groups.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re planning a trip with friends or shopping for a couch</p>
<p>with your partner, you can share all the tabs in one place.</p>
<p>And when they find something great, they can add tabs too.</p>
<p>You can see which tabs your friends are looking at live,</p>
<p>and using built-in collaboration, you can easily connect in real time</p>
<p>over Messages or FaceTime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to discover the web together.</p>
<p>And next, we have a new way to make the web a safer place.</p>
<p>We rely on passwords to protect our most private accounts.</p>
<p>While Safari helps users create the strongest passwords possible,</p>
<p>there are still ways accounts can be compromised.</p>
<p>Hackers can use social engineering techniques like phishing</p>
<p>to trick users into giving up passwords.</p>
<p>They can also breach a website directly</p>
<p>to get access to all the passwords stored on its server.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve helped create a next generation credential</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more secure, easier to use,</p>
<p>and aims to replace passwords for good.</p>
<p>We call them passkeys.</p>
<p>Passkeys use powerful cryptographic techniques</p>
<p>and the biometrics built into your device to keep accounts safe.</p>
<p>To create a passkey, just use TouchID</p>
<p>or FaceID to authenticate, and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>When users create a passkey, a unique digital key is created</p>
<p>that only works for the site it was created for.</p>
<p>Passkeys can&rsquo;t be phished.</p>
<p>Since the passkey never leaves your devices,</p>
<p>hackers can&rsquo;t trick you into sharing it on a fake website.</p>
<p>And passkeys can&rsquo;t be leaked because nothing secret is kept on a web server.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed passkeys to work in apps as easily as they do on the web.</p>
<p>Passkeys are securely synced across Apple devices using iCloud Keychain</p>
<p>and are instantly available on Mac,</p>
<p>iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working with industry leaders</p>
<p>in the FIDO alliance including Google and Microsoft,</p>
<p>to ensure that passkeys work seamlessly cross-platform.</p>
<p>With a passkey, you&rsquo;ll be able to walk up to a non-Apple device</p>
<p>and sign in to a website or app using just your iPhone.</p>
<p>The transition away from passwords will be a journey,</p>
<p>and we look forward to working with developers on the password-less future.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Safari.</p>
<p>Now back over to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: We think these updates to Mail and Safari</p>
<p>will help you be productive and browse the web</p>
<p>in new and safer ways.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s have some fun and talk about gaming.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at a point where two things are really coming together.</p>
<p>First, Apple Silicon has changed everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking the graphics performance of every new Mac to new heights,</p>
<p>giving Macs the power to run the most demanding games, with ease.</p>
<p>Second, the Mac is more popular than ever,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge and fast-growing opportunity for game developers.</p>
<p>And since we have a unified silicon architecture spanning from iPhone and iPad</p>
<p>all the way up to M1 Ultra,</p>
<p>game developers can scale the quality and performance of their titles</p>
<p>across the entire line.</p>
<p>Another key part of a great gaming experience is the software that powers it.</p>
<p>To tell you what&rsquo;s new, here&rsquo;s Jeremy.</p>
<p>Jeremy Sandmel: We continue to improve Metal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the software that powers hardware-accelerated graphics</p>
<p>on all our platforms.</p>
<p>And now, Metal 3 brings new features that will unleash</p>
<p>the full potential of Apple Silicon for years to come.</p>
<p>Gaming at maximum resolution and quality looks awesome.</p>
<p>And to help game developers increase the performance of realistic</p>
<p>and immersive graphics, we&rsquo;re introducing MetalFX Upscaling,</p>
<p>which enables developers to render rich, visually complex scenes even faster.</p>
<p>It works by rendering smaller, less compute-intensive frames</p>
<p>and then applies high-quality spatial upscaling and temporal anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>No Man&rsquo;s Sky, coming to Mac later this year,</p>
<p>will be one of the first games to use MetalFX Upscaling.</p>
<p>The frame rate increases, giving you that responsive feel, and it looks beautiful.</p>
<p>Another area we&rsquo;re improving is game loading.</p>
<p>Games continue to push the boundaries and appear more realistic than ever before</p>
<p>by using richer textures and more geometric detail,</p>
<p>which can take a while to load.</p>
<p>So Metal 3 adds a new fast resource loading API</p>
<p>that minimizes wait time by providing a more direct path</p>
<p>from storage to the unified memory system</p>
<p>so the GPU can more quickly access high-quality textures</p>
<p>and buffers without waiting.</p>
<p>Metal 3 and Apple Silicon enable even more immersive visuals,</p>
<p>faster performance, and quicker loading.</p>
<p>This really is a new day for gaming on the Mac.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t take our word for it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear from the team that has created</p>
<p>the acclaimed Resident Evil Village.</p>
<p>We are so excited it&rsquo;s coming to the Mac.</p>
<p>To tell you more, we are delighted to introduce Ijuin-san,</p>
<p>manager of Capcom&rsquo;s Advanced Technical Research Division.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Craig: Thank you, Ijuin-san.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about Continuity.</p>
<p>Continuity is all about giving you a seamless experience across devices.</p>
<p>Features like Universal Control, AirPlay, and Handoff</p>
<p>allow you to always use the right device for the moment.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re extending Handoff to FaceTime.</p>
<p>Now picture this: you answer a FaceTime call on your iPhone</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re away from your desk.</p>
<p>When you get home and bring your iPhone up close to your Mac,</p>
<p>your Mac automatically recognizes the call on your iPhone,</p>
<p>and you can move it to your Mac seamlessly,</p>
<p>giving you a bigger view to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>You can handoff calls in any direction between your devices,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll always be able to join the call from the right one.</p>
<p>We also have exciting news about another Continuity feature,</p>
<p>which pairs the best camera you own with the large displays on Mac.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time in front of our Macs with our cameras on.</p>
<p>Our webcams have become an integral part of work, school, and play.</p>
<p>And now, with Continuity Camera,</p>
<p>you can use iPhone as your webcam.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s powered by the advanced capabilities of the iPhone camera system,</p>
<p>letting you do things that were never before possible with a webcam.</p>
<p>Let me show you how it works.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m just gonna pop this stand on my iPhone,</p>
<p>and attach it to my display.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s launch FaceTime.</p>
<p>You can see my Mac automatically detects my iPhone</p>
<p>and uses it as the camera.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have to wake up my iPhone.</p>
<p>This all works wirelessly so there&rsquo;s nothing to plug in.</p>
<p>So to try this out, let&rsquo;s call a friend in the design studio.</p>
<p>Johnnie Manzari: Hi, Craig!</p>
<p>Craig: Hey, Johnnie!</p>
<p>Are you up for helping me give a demo of Continuity Camera?</p>
<p>Johnnie: Sure, I&rsquo;m using it right now.</p>
<p>with my iPhone and Pro Display XDR.</p>
<p>You know, one thing I love about Continuity Camera is Center Stage.</p>
<p>I can move around and Center Stage will keep me in the frame.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll frequently pair that with Portrait Mode</p>
<p>to blur the background with that beautiful boca.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, I&rsquo;ve loved having these features on my iPad,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great that we can now use them with any Mac.</p>
<p>Johnnie: For sure.</p>
<p>A new one people are gonna love is Studio Light.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>It brightens my face and darkens the background.</p>
<p>Craig: Hey, that looks great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you have a ring-light.</p>
<p>Johnnie: It is perfect for tough lighting conditions,</p>
<p>like if I&rsquo;m ever sitting in front of a window.</p>
<p>Okay, now I wanna show my favorite new feature, Desk View.</p>
<p>You can see the work that&rsquo;s on my desk,</p>
<p>and it keeps me in the picture.</p>
<p>It is amazing.</p>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>It looks like I have a dedicated overhead camera,</p>
<p>but this is Desk View creating both of these views</p>
<p>from the one ultra-wide camera on my iPhone</p>
<p>using some very powerful image processing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even need to adjust my phone.</p>
<p>Desk View&rsquo;s gonna be great for sharing new designs with my team.</p>
<p>I can even use it to show my nephew a new card trick.</p>
<p>Craig: This is gonna be so cool.</p>
<p>Well, hey, Johnnie, thanks for helping us give the quick demo.</p>
<p>Johnnie: No problem. I&rsquo;ll talk to you later.</p>
<p>Craig: In addition to FaceTime, you can use Continuity Camera</p>
<p>with any macOS videoconferencing app</p>
<p>like Zoom, Teams, Webex, and more.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re working with Belkin to offer beautiful stands</p>
<p>to hold your iPhone at the perfect height and angle.</p>
<p>These will be available later this year.</p>
<p>And since so many of you with a Mac already have an iPhone,</p>
<p>these great capabilities come with the devices you already own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the magic of Continuity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s macOS Ventura,</p>
<p>a feature-packed release that brings new tools for managing windows,</p>
<p>smart new features for Mail, Safari, and games,</p>
<p>and magical new Continuity features.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn to iPadOS.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Our vision for iPadOS</p>
<p>is to create a distinct experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built on the best of iOS,</p>
<p>like security, mobility, and an intuitive touch-first interface,</p>
<p>with powerful capabilities from macOS,</p>
<p>like multitasking and trackpad support,</p>
<p>combined with features like Apple Pencil that are uniquely iPad.</p>
<p>All of this comes together to deliver our most versatile device.</p>
<p>This year in iPadOS 16, we have a big release</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to take this versatility even further.</p>
<p>Starting with a host of features that you heard about earlier in iOS and macOS</p>
<p>that are going to be great on iPad,</p>
<p>like Shared Photo Library,</p>
<p>Shared Tab Groups and Passkeys in Safari,</p>
<p>and a big update to Mail.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also bringing Weather to iPad,</p>
<p>taking full advantage of the stunning display with beautiful animations</p>
<p>like these gently moving clouds,</p>
<p>heavy snowfall, and driving rain.</p>
<p>And all of these modules are tappable to access detailed information.</p>
<p>And for developers, we&rsquo;re announcing WeatherKit</p>
<p>so they can build weather into their apps.</p>
<p>iPadOS 16 also includes new ways to collaborate with others,</p>
<p>more capable apps, and new features for Pro users</p>
<p>that take advantage of the power of the M1 chip.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with collaboration,</p>
<p>which often begins in Messages</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re asked to pass along a document.</p>
<p>Of course, you could send a copy,</p>
<p>but now you can also instantly kick off a collaboration</p>
<p>when you send something with the Share Sheet.</p>
<p>This makes initiating collaboration across the system</p>
<p>as easy as sending a link,</p>
<p>and means a conversation with your collaborators is always just a tap away.</p>
<p>Let me show you how it works.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s tap in to Messages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to the team about an upcoming offsite,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been using this conversation to figure out the details.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like a message just came in from Lopp,</p>
<p>and he wants to catch up on the latest.</p>
<p>Over here in Pages, I&rsquo;ve been collecting our ideas.</p>
<p>I want to share this with the group.</p>
<p>In the past, when I&rsquo;d tap Share,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d end up sharing a copy.</p>
<p>But now, you&rsquo;ll notice I can start collaboration right here.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s great is, I don&rsquo;t need to type in a bunch of names</p>
<p>or email addresses.</p>
<p>When I select a Messages group, everyone gets added automatically.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go ahead and send it.</p>
<p>This makes it way easier to collaborate with people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already communicating with.</p>
<p>Everyone can immediately join and start making edits,</p>
<p>like the ones you see here.</p>
<p>And back in the Messages conversation,</p>
<p>I even get a notice of any changes I might have missed.</p>
<p>When you collaborate this way, your document is connected</p>
<p>to the conversation.</p>
<p>The group appears in the toolbar,</p>
<p>and I can kick off communication right from here.</p>
<p>I can get back to the messages conversation</p>
<p>or initiate a FaceTime call.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go ahead and call the group.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone!</p>
<p>Michael Lopp: Hey, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: Hey, I saw that a few of you were in the document.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other ideas for the offsite?</p>
<p>Lopp: Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it, and I&rsquo;ve been collecting a few tabs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna share them right now with you in Safari.</p>
<p>Craig: Thanks, Lopp.</p>
<p>This year, you can start collaborating with the group right in FaceTime.</p>
<p>You can see that Lopp just invited me to collaborate on a set of tabs in Safari.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and accept his invite,</p>
<p>and now, I can get to them in Safari.</p>
<p>Just like with the Pages document,</p>
<p>everyone in the group automatically has access.</p>
<p>I can see Anne and Mindy joining the tab group,</p>
<p>and I can even see which tabs people are looking at right in the tab bar.</p>
<p>Looks like Mindy is checking out kayaking.</p>
<p>Lopp: Found a few more. Check these out.</p>
<p>Craig: When Lopp adds tabs, they instantly appear</p>
<p>so we can all check them out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, we already did this last year,</p>
<p>but ziplining looks cool!</p>
<p>All right, team, let&rsquo;s wrap this up</p>
<p>and update our document with the latest ideas.</p>
<p>Looks like Anne is updating the text,</p>
<p>and Mindy just dropped in an image,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re all set.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a quick look at some of the new ways</p>
<p>you can work together with collaboration with iPadOS 16.</p>
<p>In addition to Pages and Safari,</p>
<p>these new collaboration features will work with a variety of apps,</p>
<p>like Notes and Keynote.</p>
<p>And for developers, there&rsquo;s a new API to integrate collaboration in their apps,</p>
<p>and these features will also be coming to iOS and macOS.</p>
<p>Of course, when you&rsquo;re collaborating live,</p>
<p>sometimes you want a space where you can brainstorm</p>
<p>and capture ideas as they strike.</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re giving you a sneak peek at a brand-new app called Freeform</p>
<p>coming later this year.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, here&rsquo;s Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Reid: We have so many great ways to collaborate,</p>
<p>but up until now, you didn&rsquo;t have a space to work in,</p>
<p>a place for group sessions, project planning,</p>
<p>home renovations, or school projects.</p>
<p>Now, you can be on a FaceTime call,</p>
<p>and with a tap, you&rsquo;re all collaborating live on a Freeform board.</p>
<p>You can add almost anything to a board.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect for brainstorming sessions, jotting down notes,</p>
<p>sharing files, or even creating diagrams with others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s flexible, limited only by your imagination.</p>
<p>As others begin adding their thoughts,</p>
<p>you can see their live cursors showing you right where they&rsquo;re working.</p>
<p>And if someone is in another part of Freeform,</p>
<p>you can just tap to jump straight to where they are on the board.</p>
<p>And any time you need more space, move around simply using touch,</p>
<p>or focus on what&rsquo;s really important with a pinch.</p>
<p>Of course, with a full complement of drawing tools,</p>
<p>you can sketch or write a note anywhere you&rsquo;d like with Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>And with all the powerful tools to create content on iPad,</p>
<p>Freeform is a great place to pull it all together,</p>
<p>including photos, video, audio,</p>
<p>documents, PDFs, web links,</p>
<p>pretty much anything you need to work with can be brought onto your board.</p>
<p>And you can preview right in line, including multipage documents</p>
<p>and high-resolution videos,</p>
<p>giving you everything you need</p>
<p>to bring your ideas to life right at your fingertips.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a sneak peek at Freeform.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig: Freeform is going to be a great way</p>
<p>to brainstorm your ideas with others,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re building it right into iPadOS,</p>
<p>macOS, and iOS later this year.</p>
<p>Of course, the versatility of iPad means you can seamlessly move</p>
<p>from being productive to gaming.</p>
<p>With its stunning display, built-in sensors,</p>
<p>and support for your favorite game controller,</p>
<p>iPad provides a great gaming experience.</p>
<p>And the M1 chip delivers high-performance graphics,</p>
<p>enabling immersive games like Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>
<p>In iPadOS 16, we have some great updates to gaming,</p>
<p>starting with Metal 3,</p>
<p>which brings the same MetalFX upscaling</p>
<p>and fast resource loading API to iPad that we talked about earlier with macOS.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a new API</p>
<p>that lets games download large assets in the background,</p>
<p>enabling you to multitask while the download completes.</p>
<p>Another important aspect to gaming on iPad is how it brings us together.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of games use Game Center to help us</p>
<p>play with our friends or compete against each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to jump right in and play without creating a new account,</p>
<p>using your Game Center profile.</p>
<p>You can find friends to play with, compare scores on leaderboards,</p>
<p>and track progress through achievements.</p>
<p>And now, we&rsquo;re bringing Activity to the Game Center dashboard.</p>
<p>You can see what your friends are playing, highlights of their achievements,</p>
<p>and even find out when they beat your high score,</p>
<p>so you know when it&rsquo;s time to take your game to the next level</p>
<p>and get back on top.</p>
<p>And all of this activity appears on your Game Center profile.</p>
<p>Game Center has always supported playing together in real time.</p>
<p>Now, SharePlay makes it simple to join and play.</p>
<p>In a multiplayer game using Game Center,</p>
<p>just start a SharePlay session and bring your friends right in.</p>
<p>These new Game Center features will be coming to an update</p>
<p>to iPadOS 16 later this year,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re also bringing them to iOS and macOS.</p>
<p>The versatility of iPad makes it great for so many things,</p>
<p>and a big part of that is apps.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re continuing our work to make iPad apps more capable</p>
<p>with desktop-class apps.</p>
<p>While many iPad apps have their origins in iOS,</p>
<p>over the years, they&rsquo;ve taken on their own unique capabilities,</p>
<p>optimized for the iPad&rsquo;s larger display.</p>
<p>In iPadOS 16, we scoured the entire system,</p>
<p>adding enhancements across the board,</p>
<p>from system elements and interactions</p>
<p>to new features you use on Mac and want on iPad.</p>
<p>Let me highlight a few of them.</p>
<p>Undo/redo across the system,</p>
<p>availability view in Calendar,</p>
<p>find and merge cards and create lists in Contacts,</p>
<p>and we have a big update to Files,</p>
<p>with some of the most requested features,</p>
<p>such as the ability to change file extensions,</p>
<p>view folder size, and more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also added system-wide features that deliver improvements across apps,</p>
<p>starting with a redesigned find and replace experience</p>
<p>that works in-line.</p>
<p>A document menu in apps like Files, Pages, and Keynote</p>
<p>that reveals common actions you may want to take,</p>
<p>such as duplicate, rename, export, and print.</p>
<p>And for the first time ever, customizable toolbars in iPadOS</p>
<p>so you can add the tools that matter to you most.</p>
<p>And for developers, we&rsquo;ve created new APIs,</p>
<p>so they can build these capabilities right into their own apps.</p>
<p>These features will help you be more productive.</p>
<p>And we have another feature for Mac that will be great</p>
<p>for creative pros on iPad.</p>
<p>And that is reference color.</p>
<p>The Liquid Retina XDR display in our latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro</p>
<p>is great for professional color workflows.</p>
<p>And with iPadOS 16, we&rsquo;re introducing Reference Mode,</p>
<p>which meets the color requirements in workflows like review and approve,</p>
<p>color grading, and compositing,</p>
<p>where accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical.</p>
<p>So whether you prefer using iPad Pro as a standalone device</p>
<p>or as a second display with Sidecar,</p>
<p>Reference Mode provides a consistent reference workflow</p>
<p>across your pro devices,</p>
<p>making iPad Pro an indispensable tool for creative professionals.</p>
<p>Now, I want to turn our attention to a set of features</p>
<p>enabled by the performance of the M1 chip</p>
<p>in our latest iPad Pro and iPad Air.</p>
<p>Features for people who push the versatility of iPad to the limit.</p>
<p>Pros are always wanting more space to work with,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re adding a new display scaling setting,</p>
<p>which allows you to increase the pixel density of the display</p>
<p>so you can view more in your apps,</p>
<p>which is particularly helpful when using Split View.</p>
<p>We also want to enable you to do more in apps.</p>
<p>Our latest iPad Air and iPad Pro</p>
<p>come with a ton of ultra-fast memory and storage.</p>
<p>iPadOS 16 adds support for virtual memory swap,</p>
<p>meaning your iPad storage can be used</p>
<p>to expand the available memory for all apps</p>
<p>and delivers up to 16 GB of memory to the most demanding apps.</p>
<p>With technologies like display scaling and virtual memory swap,</p>
<p>we have the foundation for a big leap forward in user experience,</p>
<p>one that can change how our Pro users get work done on iPad.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re bringing Stage Manager,</p>
<p>our latest windowing system that you just saw in macOS, to iPadOS.</p>
<p>Stage Manager takes multitasking on iPad to a whole new level</p>
<p>by making it more nimble and unlocking full external display support.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to show it to you now.</p>
<p>Today on iPad, when you use apps,</p>
<p>you get the full screen experience that we&rsquo;re all familiar with,</p>
<p>like in Photos here.</p>
<p>With Stage Manager activated, I can now resize windows,</p>
<p>exposing a powerful new way to work with apps on iPad.</p>
<p>And the Dock is visible, so I can easily get to all my apps.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s open Music.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that all my recently used apps appear on the left,</p>
<p>so switching between them is really fast.</p>
<p>And Stage Manager gives me powerful new layout capabilities</p>
<p>to create my ideal workspace.</p>
<p>For the first time on iPad, I can work with overlapping windows.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna drag Messages alongside Calendar here,</p>
<p>and Stage Manager automatically moves Calendar gently off to the side</p>
<p>as I bring it to the stage.</p>
<p>And if I move Messages to the left,</p>
<p>Stage Manager repositions Calendar for me automatically.</p>
<p>And like you saw earlier, I can resize windows</p>
<p>and arrange everything just the way I want.</p>
<p>And it gets even better</p>
<p>when I plug my iPad into an external display.</p>
<p>My wallpaper beautifully fills the entire display,</p>
<p>and I can move my cursor to it from my iPad.</p>
<p>I have the Dock here too, so let&rsquo;s go ahead and launch Keynote.</p>
<p>When I do, I once again enter Stage Manager,</p>
<p>now on an even bigger canvas.</p>
<p>All of that additional screen real estate is so useful</p>
<p>when working on a presentation in Keynote.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing when you&rsquo;re working with a set of apps.</p>
<p>I can create groups of three and even four windows.</p>
<p>This is just incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>Between my iPad and my external display,</p>
<p>I can have up to eight apps running onscreen simultaneously.</p>
<p>And I can take advantage of the unique capabilities of each of these displays.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;m working on this Keynote document,</p>
<p>and I want to add a drawing from Procreate</p>
<p>here on my iPad.</p>
<p>I can use Apple Pencil to add a finishing touch</p>
<p>to my drawing.</p>
<p>And now I can jump back into the gallery</p>
<p>and then drag and drop across displays and into my deck.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a quick look at Stage Manager.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entirely new way to multitask with multiple overlapping windows,</p>
<p>flexible window sets, fast app switching,</p>
<p>and full external display support.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s iPadOS 16,</p>
<p>a big release with exciting updates to many of the built-in apps;</p>
<p>Weather app comes to iPad,</p>
<p>new ways to collaborate and be productive,</p>
<p>great features for pro users, including Stage Manager,</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>Now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>Tim: Thank you, Craig.</p>
<p>And thanks to all of our presenters.</p>
