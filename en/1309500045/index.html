<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m here for you on</p>
<p>mondays let&rsquo;s get into</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>so julie kibiwishy</p>
<p>she was born on valentine&rsquo;s day in 1987</p>
<p>she was the</p>
<p>first daughter</p>
<p>to her mother june and her father masa</p>
<p>she was the baby girl that they had been</p>
<p>dreaming of she was</p>
<p>treated like a princess</p>
<p>of the house</p>
<p>but growing up</p>
<p>with two brothers</p>
<p>it brought out more of the tomboy</p>
<p>traits you know she was</p>
<p>super athletic and it was said that she loves</p>
<p>sports but when</p>
<p>she was five years old that&rsquo;s when she really got into</p>
<p>dance and dance became like her passion she did</p>
<p>every kind of dance</p>
<p>she did tap dance</p>
<p>lyrical jazz and ballet</p>
<p>plus her artistic passions really didn&rsquo;t stop with</p>
<p>dance she was just</p>
<p>overall a very artistic girl she</p>
<p>loved design</p>
<p>and she also enrolled at</p>
<p>orange coast college in</p>
<p>southern california</p>
<p>as an art major</p>
<p>while living at home with her parents</p>
<p>so on friday may 21</p>
<p>2010 julie told her mom that she was headed to long</p>
<p>beach to meet with her brother for</p>
<p>dinner to help him and his fiance</p>
<p>plan for their wedding</p>
<p>um she told her</p>
<p>mother not to stay up because she&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>you know she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be home until late</p>
<p>so she says bye mom</p>
<p>love you and then</p>
<p>heads out the door and then that was the last time june</p>
<p>saw her daughter alive so</p>
<p>while at dinner with her brother and soon to be</p>
<p>sister in law</p>
<p>julie her phone kept</p>
<p>going off because</p>
<p>she was getting text messages from her friend sam</p>
<p>hair now the text messages suggested</p>
<p>that sam was having some kind of family problem</p>
<p>and he just needed like a</p>
<p>shoulder to cry on</p>
<p>i think the text said something</p>
<p>along the lines of quote</p>
<p>just needed a girl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shoulder to cry on</p>
<p>julie told her brother</p>
<p>about sam saying that he was just</p>
<p>a friend but that he was like a big brother and that</p>
<p>if he got the chance to meet sam</p>
<p>he would definitely like him now sam</p>
<p>was the only</p>
<p>child of steve and raquel</p>
<p>and he was a decorated combat</p>
<p>veteran in the us army he had served in afghan</p>
<p>afghanistan</p>
<p>and sam had</p>
<p>come home and enrolled in college so that he</p>
<p>could get his degree and go back into the army</p>
<p>because he really liked to</p>
<p>travel his father</p>
<p>would describe him as a</p>
<p>a big bloop</p>
<p>he was one week shy of his</p>
<p>27th birthday</p>
<p>and sam and</p>
<p>julie they were</p>
<p>again they were just friends sam was like a big brother</p>
<p>to everyone</p>
<p>and always there for anyone who needed him</p>
<p>he was just like an all around</p>
<p>person it sounded like and</p>
<p>julie ended up tutoring sam</p>
<p>in anthropology</p>
<p>and she helped sam get an a in that</p>
<p>class and julie</p>
<p>she was very loving and a giving person</p>
<p>the kind of person who</p>
<p>would bend over backwards for a friend so</p>
<p>they just really cared</p>
<p>about each other</p>
<p>but julie was feeling a little concerned</p>
<p>about sam because of the text that she had received</p>
<p>so she tells her brother like hey i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go over to sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment and kind of see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with him</p>
<p>cause he doesn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;s doing too well</p>
<p>so she ends up leaving her brother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>place and she heads out to sam&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>so the next morning comes</p>
<p>along it was saturday morning and</p>
<p>julie wasn&rsquo;t home</p>
<p>so her mom wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like immediately</p>
<p>worried but</p>
<p>you know she sent out a text to</p>
<p>julie asking like hey</p>
<p>where are you at</p>
<p>but she knew that like if</p>
<p>julie had been</p>
<p>drinking at all she would</p>
<p>often stay at her brother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>place cause</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t drink and</p>
<p>drive so she wasn&rsquo;t like too</p>
<p>worried she just need to figure out</p>
<p>where she was at</p>
<p>but when julie</p>
<p>still wasn&rsquo;t home around noon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when june</p>
<p>texted her daughter</p>
<p>again and she didn&rsquo;t get a response</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like okay like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on so she calls her</p>
<p>daughter and</p>
<p>the phone just</p>
<p>rings and rings and then it just goes to voicemail</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s when june was like really</p>
<p>started to get</p>
<p>worried cause</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just unlike her</p>
<p>daughter you know</p>
<p>so june called her son</p>
<p>to see if he knew</p>
<p>where julie was</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when she</p>
<p>learned that</p>
<p>julie had gone to sam&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>night so she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have sam&rsquo;s number but june had a list of</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>phone numbers</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>maybe i can like you know</p>
<p>call them all up and somebody has to have sam&rsquo;s number</p>
<p>or maybe somebody knows</p>
<p>where like julie is at</p>
<p>so she goes down the list and she</p>
<p>starts contacting everyone she can</p>
<p>now nobody had seen julie</p>
<p>and her mom said that she had that</p>
<p>that like sickening feeling</p>
<p>in her stomach you know when something is just not</p>
<p>right you know so when she couldn&rsquo;t get a hold of her</p>
<p>daughter figure out</p>
<p>where her daughter was at</p>
<p>she decides to call the irvine police to</p>
<p>place a missing persons report</p>
<p>but julie wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>only person not responding to calls or text messages</p>
<p>on saturday may</p>
<p>twenty second</p>
<p>sam was also supposed to like</p>
<p>spend the weekend with his family</p>
<p>saturday came and his family had not</p>
<p>heard from him like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s he at you know</p>
<p>hours go by they try to call him</p>
<p>but the calls are just</p>
<p>going straight to voicemail okay</p>
<p>weird you know</p>
<p>so sam&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>he had a key to sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment in costa mesa</p>
<p>so he was like okay maybe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just go down there and</p>
<p>see if sam&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>maybe he lost his</p>
<p>phone maybe</p>
<p>whatever you know let me just go down there</p>
<p>so his dad goes down there</p>
<p>and what he finds</p>
<p>is just an awful</p>
<p>scene something he did not expect</p>
<p>so his dad goes out there</p>
<p>right cool so he lets himself in and when he</p>
<p>first walks in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he finds a</p>
<p>young woman</p>
<p>lying face down on sam&rsquo;s bed</p>
<p>with a gunshot wound</p>
<p>to her head</p>
<p>some of her</p>
<p>clothes had been ripped off she was also wearing a</p>
<p>tiara it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>weird but there was also a message that was written</p>
<p>on her clothing it was on the back of her</p>
<p>sweatshirt it said</p>
<p>quote all yours</p>
<p>fuck you i know</p>
<p>creepy and so</p>
<p>steve obviously horrified</p>
<p>he calls 911 immediately and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>hysterical poor guy</p>
<p>i mean any of us would be</p>
<p>right i would hope</p>
<p>but there was no sign of sam it was odd it was</p>
<p>weird so the</p>
<p>young woman was</p>
<p>identified as julie</p>
<p>on her cell</p>
<p>phone police</p>
<p>found text messages between sam and</p>
<p>julie asking for her to come over</p>
<p>back at julie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house police were questioning june</p>
<p>about her missing daughter</p>
<p>cause they came over for the missing person report</p>
<p>so the police are already over</p>
<p>there you know getting some information and what not</p>
<p>and then i guess</p>
<p>like one of the police officers they like step out</p>
<p>they go to the police car and like they&rsquo;re in there for</p>
<p>quite a bit</p>
<p>and the police officer comes back in june</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s mom said that he looked different he</p>
<p>sounded different</p>
<p>and to her something</p>
<p>something wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>the only thing that june</p>
<p>could think was oh gosh</p>
<p>you know was</p>
<p>julie in a car accident</p>
<p>did something happen to her</p>
<p>sadly the officer told her that they found</p>
<p>julie in sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment and</p>
<p>all june could say was like no no no no</p>
<p>no that wasn&rsquo;t her no but it was julie</p>
<p>police found</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s purse</p>
<p>and her id at the scene</p>
<p>to police it seemed pretty cut and dry</p>
<p>a pretty cut and dry case i</p>
<p>should say it seemed that sam</p>
<p>had raped and killed</p>
<p>julie and was now like on the run</p>
<p>despite the family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>claims that</p>
<p>the relationship</p>
<p>was platonic</p>
<p>detectives wondered if the message on julie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweatshirt was</p>
<p>alluding to some kind of love triangle gone wrong</p>
<p>but the fact that sam</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>made detectives and police</p>
<p>think that he was just on the run</p>
<p>sam also had a bit of a criminal past</p>
<p>at the age of 18</p>
<p>sam had gotten</p>
<p>mixed up with like a rough</p>
<p>crowd that included</p>
<p>different members</p>
<p>of different gangs i guess</p>
<p>and in this group</p>
<p>there was a person murdered and then there was</p>
<p>another person who was killed in</p>
<p>connection to that so sam</p>
<p>along with 23</p>
<p>other people they were arrested and</p>
<p>charged with murder sam</p>
<p>was eventually acquitted</p>
<p>but with this little</p>
<p>brush with the law confirmed</p>
<p>police&rsquo;s suspicion that sam</p>
<p>was probably responsible for</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>so his father</p>
<p>understood that sam is</p>
<p>going to be the primary suspect because i mean</p>
<p>hello julie is</p>
<p>found in his</p>
<p>apartment murdered steve</p>
<p>understands like okay it&rsquo;s not looking good for sam</p>
<p>but he had this gut feeling that</p>
<p>sam was not the one who did it so steve</p>
<p>took it upon himself to</p>
<p>prove his son&rsquo;s innocence</p>
<p>because police</p>
<p>are already like okay sam&rsquo;s the one who did this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in his</p>
<p>apartment he texted her to come over</p>
<p>sam did it but his father is like heck no i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do some investigating myself and</p>
<p>make sure and prove</p>
<p>that sam didn&rsquo;t do it i feel like</p>
<p>i made that way more complicated than it needed to be</p>
<p>but you get it</p>
<p>so steve starts calling all of sam&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>none of them had seen or</p>
<p>heard from sam they all wanted to help though so</p>
<p>they were like here are some</p>
<p>phone numbers of different friends to call</p>
<p>and steve called</p>
<p>those friends</p>
<p>one of those people that he</p>
<p>spoke to was</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s neighbor</p>
<p>who lived in the same</p>
<p>apartment complex as sam</p>
<p>and it was a</p>
<p>guy by the name of daniel wozniak so he calls him up</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah i saw sam on friday but i really haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard from him since</p>
<p>on may 24th</p>
<p>steve was able to get access</p>
<p>to sam&rsquo;s bank account records</p>
<p>and immediately he noticed that there was</p>
<p>money being withdrawn from one bank on</p>
<p>three different days</p>
<p>it was being withdrawn</p>
<p>from an atm next to a pizzeria</p>
<p>in long beach</p>
<p>not far from sam&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>there was also a charge</p>
<p>from the restaurant</p>
<p>on the card as well</p>
<p>so somebody was eating some</p>
<p>pizza and getting some cash you know</p>
<p>very suspicious</p>
<p>so steve goes</p>
<p>down to the location of the bank and the pizza</p>
<p>place and he&rsquo;s just waiting outside to see if anyone</p>
<p>someone is coming</p>
<p>going i don&rsquo;t know maybe</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s looking for sam</p>
<p>maybe sam&rsquo;s around or his car he&rsquo;s just thinking</p>
<p>if his son is on the run</p>
<p>maybe he could at</p>
<p>least spot him</p>
<p>talk some common</p>
<p>sense into him</p>
<p>before everything came</p>
<p>crashing down you know so he&rsquo;s just sitting there</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just waiting</p>
<p>but unfortunately</p>
<p>like no luck no sign of sam</p>
<p>on tuesday morning</p>
<p>steve called</p>
<p>back some of sam&rsquo;s friends and when he called up</p>
<p>dan wozniak</p>
<p>again this time it was kind of strange cause dan</p>
<p>changed his</p>
<p>story like you</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>lying about something then your</p>
<p>story doesn&rsquo;t need to change</p>
<p>so this time dan</p>
<p>said that sam</p>
<p>told him he was having family problems</p>
<p>now steve knew</p>
<p>right off the bat</p>
<p>that this dan guy was</p>
<p>lying because</p>
<p>steve and sam</p>
<p>father son extremely</p>
<p>close okay their relationship</p>
<p>super tight</p>
<p>as far as he knew there was no issue</p>
<p>going on between him and his son</p>
<p>nor with any of the family members so</p>
<p>try again you know like that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right dan dan</p>
<p>no steve&rsquo;s little detective work</p>
<p>got his senses</p>
<p>tingling when he realized that out of all the</p>
<p>phone numbers he had called dan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone number was the only one that had a long</p>
<p>beach area code hmm</p>
<p>the same area</p>
<p>or the same area code of the atm</p>
<p>and the pizza restaurant</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t like say a lot</p>
<p>but at the same time it</p>
<p>like got that little gut feeling of like hmm</p>
<p>something ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right so police were able to get security footage</p>
<p>from the atm</p>
<p>machine so the security tape showed that the</p>
<p>someone went to the atm machine</p>
<p>right it was a young</p>
<p>white male somewhere between the</p>
<p>age of 17 to 20</p>
<p>they were wearing a baseball hat</p>
<p>using sam&rsquo;s car to withdraw</p>
<p>money from sam&rsquo;s bank account</p>
<p>it was shown that whoever this person was was not sam</p>
<p>so it was actually this kid</p>
<p>named wesley</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>great who the heck is this wesley guy</p>
<p>so once you&rsquo;re able to id who this person is</p>
<p>police are able to get</p>
<p>the whole shebang</p>
<p>two police cars an fbi van</p>
<p>and a helicopter</p>
<p>were all dispatched to go</p>
<p>to this wesley guy&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>believing that he was helping hide sam</p>
<p>or maybe helped sam in some kind of way</p>
<p>now when they show up to wesley&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s like whoa whoa</p>
<p>whoa whoa hold on</p>
<p>you know like this is a little much</p>
<p>wesley was like he got the wrong guy</p>
<p>so obviously he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaked out like i don&rsquo;t know what the heck is</p>
<p>going on this guy dan wozniak he</p>
<p>approached me and</p>
<p>asked me if i</p>
<p>could withdraw</p>
<p>money from his bank for him</p>
<p>because he was busy or something and he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the money himself and that&rsquo;s why i went to the atm</p>
<p>so investigators</p>
<p>were like well how do you know this dan guy</p>
<p>and wesley was like oh dan yeah</p>
<p>dan and i know each</p>
<p>other way back when from like middle school</p>
<p>dan was a part of some</p>
<p>local theater</p>
<p>group where his mom was a teacher</p>
<p>and that dan was a fantastic guy just one of</p>
<p>those guys that he wanted</p>
<p>to be around because he was so kind and he</p>
<p>could make everybody and anybody</p>
<p>laugh so when dan</p>
<p>asked him if he</p>
<p>could do this</p>
<p>favor wesley had no reason to believe that there is any</p>
<p>issue you know</p>
<p>well both wesley and</p>
<p>steve were pointing the fingers at dan</p>
<p>police charged dan</p>
<p>with accessory to murder of</p>
<p>julie and arrested him in hopes of dan</p>
<p>giving them information on</p>
<p>where like sam was at</p>
<p>so dan was getting</p>
<p>married in a few days</p>
<p>and he was actually having his bachelor</p>
<p>party when police came in and arrested him i know</p>
<p>he probably thought like the police were hired</p>
<p>strippers or something nene</p>
<p>it was a real deal</p>
<p>he was like am i</p>
<p>under arrest officer i&rsquo;ve been real bad</p>
<p>and like he was really actually</p>
<p>under arrest</p>
<p>so dan gets arrested now</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s this dan guy well let me tell you dan wozniak was</p>
<p>26 year old community theater actor</p>
<p>and a part of the</p>
<p>local theater company</p>
<p>people often described him as a</p>
<p>super nice guy</p>
<p>he was good looking</p>
<p>and very personable</p>
<p>now he was engaged his</p>
<p>fiance her name was rachel buffett</p>
<p>they had met each</p>
<p>other when dan was doing a play</p>
<p>she was also an actress</p>
<p>and she worked as a disney princess at disneyland</p>
<p>the two had fell in love and in</p>
<p>2008 dan proposed</p>
<p>during questioning dan repeatedly</p>
<p>told cops that he had nothing to do with anything</p>
<p>but over time his story</p>
<p>started to change</p>
<p>he did admit to police that he had manipulated wesley</p>
<p>into making the atm withdrawals from sam&rsquo;s account</p>
<p>he said it was for sam</p>
<p>but then later dan told police that sam confessed</p>
<p>to dan that he had killed</p>
<p>julie in his</p>
<p>apartment upstairs now dan said that</p>
<p>sam threatened him</p>
<p>and if he didn&rsquo;t help him escape</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come for him next or something</p>
<p>but dan swore up and down that</p>
<p>he had nothing to do with</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t believe you dan</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t believe you</p>
<p>your stories</p>
<p>changed like a</p>
<p>whole bunch</p>
<p>so during interrogation so they asked dan</p>
<p>hey can you give us some spit you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do some dna testing</p>
<p>and then dan all of a</p>
<p>sudden is like whoa actually</p>
<p>i got a different</p>
<p>story for you</p>
<p>you know hey new story</p>
<p>i hate people</p>
<p>this time he</p>
<p>claimed he stopped by sam&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>and he discovered</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s body okay</p>
<p>saying when he went inside he saw</p>
<p>two bullet holes in her head</p>
<p>now this was a little</p>
<p>light bulb moment to police because</p>
<p>you see you</p>
<p>could only see one</p>
<p>exit gunshot wound</p>
<p>on julie the</p>
<p>second gunshot</p>
<p>wound was covered</p>
<p>sorry to get</p>
<p>graphic but it was like</p>
<p>covered with like</p>
<p>brain matter</p>
<p>and was only discovered during the autopsy</p>
<p>so nobody even knew that there was two</p>
<p>but dan did</p>
<p>all of a sudden</p>
<p>weird you know</p>
<p>so with this information it was</p>
<p>clear that dan</p>
<p>must have been there when</p>
<p>julie was killed because nobody</p>
<p>would know that</p>
<p>dan rachel dan&rsquo;s fiance</p>
<p>she was brought</p>
<p>in for questioning and her behavior was really odd</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a lot of debate around</p>
<p>her because they brought</p>
<p>her in and they&rsquo;re like hey you know your fiance</p>
<p>was under arrest</p>
<p>for covering up a murder okay</p>
<p>now they thought it was strange</p>
<p>cause her reaction was just kind of like oh yeah</p>
<p>weird like she was not it just</p>
<p>was just like</p>
<p>a normal day for her like she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shocked at all</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>like okay well if somebody got this information</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you be a little</p>
<p>shocked that your fiance</p>
<p>may be involved with some kind of murder</p>
<p>situation i mean for</p>
<p>for christ&rsquo;s sake she&rsquo;s an actress</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t she at</p>
<p>least pretend</p>
<p>to be a little</p>
<p>shocked that her fiance</p>
<p>maybe being involved with the murder</p>
<p>but instead she was like oh</p>
<p>weird that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy that he</p>
<p>might be involved but okay</p>
<p>so strange so she</p>
<p>claimed that</p>
<p>she knew nothing</p>
<p>okay but her</p>
<p>story was all over the place she</p>
<p>was saying that she had not seen sam at all then she</p>
<p>later mentioned seeing a mystery friend at sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apartment her</p>
<p>story just wasn&rsquo;t lining up it just wasn&rsquo;t making sense</p>
<p>something was something wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right but they also just didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>so dan was arrested and he was sitting in jail</p>
<p>now he was able to make a</p>
<p>phone call that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>stupid this guy is he&rsquo;s such an idiot i</p>
<p>swear to you</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to make a phone call he calls his fiance</p>
<p>ding ding ding ding ding hello</p>
<p>you know hey</p>
<p>so he calls up his fiance</p>
<p>rachel so rachel</p>
<p>tells dan that she</p>
<p>spoke to his brother tim</p>
<p>that tim told her</p>
<p>that dan had</p>
<p>given him a backpack of evidence and</p>
<p>in this backpack</p>
<p>were shell casings from</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s wallet</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s id sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>checkbook and sam&rsquo;s bloody clothes</p>
<p>so dan gave this</p>
<p>all this stuff</p>
<p>so he put it in a backpack</p>
<p>and then gave it to his brother tim</p>
<p>and then tim told rachel on the</p>
<p>phone now on the</p>
<p>phone dan is begging her to not tell police</p>
<p>about this evidence</p>
<p>against him and she&rsquo;s like dan</p>
<p>yeah the prison</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re calling me from</p>
<p>all of their conversations are being recorded so</p>
<p>not okay you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>stupid sorry</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an idiot</p>
<p>so she tells dan over the phone</p>
<p>that as soon as they get off the</p>
<p>phone that she was calling detectives</p>
<p>and like you can hear in dan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voice he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>worried scared he</p>
<p>sounds like a little baby</p>
<p>but also some believe</p>
<p>that she was just saying that because she knew that the</p>
<p>phone call was being recorded</p>
<p>and she was kind of pretending like she didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s up for debate really</p>
<p>but dan over here just</p>
<p>sounds like a little</p>
<p>bitch if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna murder somebody</p>
<p>the least you</p>
<p>could do is own up to it instead of being a little</p>
<p>bitch so shortly</p>
<p>after this phone call with his fiance</p>
<p>dan said that he knew</p>
<p>the jig was up</p>
<p>okay he just like knew it was over for him so he</p>
<p>asked to speak to the police</p>
<p>so they come in they</p>
<p>bring them in for questioning</p>
<p>or they bring them into the interrogation room</p>
<p>and then dan</p>
<p>said something</p>
<p>no one expected</p>
<p>he told police</p>
<p>quote he was crazy</p>
<p>and that he did it</p>
<p>so police are</p>
<p>like can you please like clarify what you mean by</p>
<p>you did it because</p>
<p>you know we need more information obviously so</p>
<p>dan confessed to killing</p>
<p>julie and sam</p>
<p>so where the hell was sam</p>
<p>so this new information through police for a loop</p>
<p>because sam was not on the run</p>
<p>for julie&rsquo;s murder at all</p>
<p>he was a victim himself</p>
<p>now dan&rsquo;s confession to the murders confirmed</p>
<p>steve&rsquo;s belief</p>
<p>that his son was innocent all along but</p>
<p>it now was just gonna</p>
<p>bring like a lot</p>
<p>of devastating news as to like what really happened</p>
<p>so dan walked the police through everything</p>
<p>dan said that he was desperate for money</p>
<p>he was behind on two</p>
<p>months rent</p>
<p>and had an elaborate wedding coming up</p>
<p>and it was only weeks away</p>
<p>they also had</p>
<p>planned a very elaborate</p>
<p>honeymoon and dan</p>
<p>simply just didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money to pull all this off</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t tell his fiance</p>
<p>this she thought</p>
<p>everything was rainbows and lollipops nene</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have any money</p>
<p>dan knew that sam had</p>
<p>sixty thousand dollars in savings from combat pay</p>
<p>it was stored away from his days in the army</p>
<p>and at some</p>
<p>point he mentioned it to dan</p>
<p>so dan&rsquo;s plan was to kill sam</p>
<p>and get the</p>
<p>money from sam&rsquo;s bank account</p>
<p>use it for his wedding and his honeymoon</p>
<p>great no one will know i&rsquo;ll get away scot free like</p>
<p>what a stupid plan dan told</p>
<p>police that he texted sam that he needed help moving</p>
<p>things at the theater in fullerton</p>
<p>where he was performing</p>
<p>sam was like sure i&rsquo;ll help you out and</p>
<p>he arrives to the theater</p>
<p>dan&rsquo;s like hey will you come up with me to the attic</p>
<p>to help me move something really quick it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heavy can&rsquo;t do it myself</p>
<p>sam was like sure so they go up to the attic</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in this like area</p>
<p>dance like it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>thing i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really remember what it was but sam bends down to pick</p>
<p>whatever it was up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when dan</p>
<p>shot him in the back of his head</p>
<p>now he said that</p>
<p>after the first shot</p>
<p>sam was still</p>
<p>alive and he was asking for help</p>
<p>saying that something</p>
<p>hit him in the head it felt like an electric shock</p>
<p>so instead of helping damn reloaded and</p>
<p>fired again this time killing him</p>
<p>in the theater</p>
<p>addict now dan</p>
<p>leaves him there</p>
<p>he goes home before returning to the theater</p>
<p>with rachel</p>
<p>for that evening&rsquo;s performance of the show nine</p>
<p>which they were both starring in</p>
<p>yeah so the show went on</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re performing on</p>
<p>stage as one does i don&rsquo;t know what they</p>
<p>boo but i boo boo boo</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>dan is acting out as if nothing happened it was like a</p>
<p>great performance they said whatever meanwhile</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s body was like right</p>
<p>above them in the attic</p>
<p>beep it up like what</p>
<p>what is wrong with people i don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>so then dan told investigators that he killed</p>
<p>julie to cover his own tracks</p>
<p>he created this elaborate</p>
<p>story that he wanted to frame</p>
<p>sam as killing</p>
<p>julie and then he fled</p>
<p>so after killing sam</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he took</p>
<p>he took sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone he texted</p>
<p>julie to come over to sam&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>and said like</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m having family problem so</p>
<p>julie goes to the apartment</p>
<p>dan came up</p>
<p>to her he was like accidentally just ran into her</p>
<p>and he was like oh my god that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>here too sam just called me and said like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going through some</p>
<p>stuff but um</p>
<p>i have a key</p>
<p>and i can let you into his apartment</p>
<p>he really had to fucking plan this shit you know</p>
<p>so he has this the key to the sam&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>he opens up the apartment</p>
<p>they both go inside</p>
<p>dan lets julian they hang out for a bit</p>
<p>when they were in the</p>
<p>apartment dan called over to</p>
<p>julie and like hey come here</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>in sam&rsquo;s bedroom he&rsquo;s like hey come here</p>
<p>come over here i see something really</p>
<p>weird come here</p>
<p>and so julie comes over</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like oh my</p>
<p>dance like oh my god look</p>
<p>over there by the bed there&rsquo;s something over there you</p>
<p>should go check it out</p>
<p>julie goes over there</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s leaning over</p>
<p>to the whatever it is dan was said he saw</p>
<p>and when she&rsquo;s leaning over</p>
<p>dan shoots julie in the back of the head</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>staged the crime to make it look like a rape to</p>
<p>throw the police off</p>
<p>i just hate him</p>
<p>cause like okay what was just so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing all of this this is the most</p>
<p>selfish person ever</p>
<p>right cause he&rsquo;s doing all of this</p>
<p>just so he can get</p>
<p>money for a wedding</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you get a damn job dan</p>
<p>and rachel once you guys get some fucking</p>
<p>work or something instead of getting married</p>
<p>bunch of losers</p>
<p>i hate them</p>
<p>so then as if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get any more fucked up because it totally does</p>
<p>so then the next day</p>
<p>after the murders</p>
<p>dan said that he went back to the theater</p>
<p>he went up to the attic</p>
<p>and he dismembered sam&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>what in the fucked up is</p>
<p>going on around here</p>
<p>dan said that he dismembered sam&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>a little extreme</p>
<p>but dan was saying as if this justifies it in some way</p>
<p>that he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get him out of the attic without people noticing</p>
<p>right like if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>carrying a dead body out</p>
<p>might be a little obvious</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>let me dismember him cut him up that makes way more</p>
<p>sense to me in my dumbass brain</p>
<p>and then dan told police that he remember smiling and</p>
<p>laughing because he had just reached a</p>
<p>point where he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t even believe what he was doing anymore he just</p>
<p>found the whole</p>
<p>thing hilarious</p>
<p>anyways so he</p>
<p>ended up leaving sam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>torso and other limbs in the attic because</p>
<p>he just couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take it down yet so he disposed of sam&rsquo;s head hands and</p>
<p>tattooed forearm</p>
<p>in the eldorado park in long beach</p>
<p>he tells this to police and detectives end up</p>
<p>going out to the park</p>
<p>and to the theater</p>
<p>and they find sam&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>on what would have been his</p>
<p>27th birthday talk</p>
<p>about fucked up</p>
<p>sadly though animals had gotten to</p>
<p>pieces of his body in the park</p>
<p>and one of his hands was</p>
<p>never found</p>
<p>sam was given a hero&rsquo;s burial with full military</p>
<p>honors and daniel</p>
<p>wozniak was officially</p>
<p>charged with two</p>
<p>counts of first degree murder during the</p>
<p>trial a witness</p>
<p>named chris williams came</p>
<p>forward and told police that he had been at daniels and</p>
<p>rachel&rsquo;s apartment the day sam was murdered</p>
<p>he said that he loaned the couple some money</p>
<p>and was there to collect it</p>
<p>daniel or dan</p>
<p>must have known</p>
<p>about sam&rsquo;s savings account</p>
<p>and asked sam</p>
<p>for a loan so he</p>
<p>could pay back chris</p>
<p>so together they went to go pick up the cash</p>
<p>while chris stayed behind with rachel</p>
<p>three hours</p>
<p>later dan returned</p>
<p>alone with 400</p>
<p>and gave it to chris</p>
<p>later during questioning rachel maintained that sam was</p>
<p>still alive during this exchange both rachel</p>
<p>and dan&rsquo;s brother tim</p>
<p>were arrested and</p>
<p>charged with accessory</p>
<p>after the fact</p>
<p>tim wozniak</p>
<p>dan&rsquo;s brother he pled guilty to being an accessory</p>
<p>after the fact</p>
<p>for hiding dan&rsquo;s backpack full of the evidence</p>
<p>which included</p>
<p>again the shell casings from</p>
<p>julie&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s wallet sam&rsquo;s id</p>
<p>his checkbook</p>
<p>and his bloody</p>
<p>clothes so he testified</p>
<p>against his brother as a part of a plea</p>
<p>agreement now dan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defense attorney was trying to</p>
<p>shift the blame onto rachel the fiance</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>she was the one who wanted the expensive wedding</p>
<p>that she was the one who was</p>
<p>smarter of the two and she</p>
<p>was involved</p>
<p>many speculated</p>
<p>how did she not know what happened</p>
<p>when she was brought in for questioning</p>
<p>her reaction was off like</p>
<p>things just didn&rsquo;t add up with rachel</p>
<p>but she stood by the fact that she was innocent</p>
<p>um that she did not know anything</p>
<p>she was just</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>she would later go on the doctor phil show</p>
<p>and she was like giving an exclusive interview</p>
<p>while she was out in bail she was like</p>
<p>oh my god i didn&rsquo;t know anything i&rsquo;m not a damn thing</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know but she</p>
<p>claimed that she too was a</p>
<p>victim of dance</p>
<p>saying that she had wish she</p>
<p>never met him like i</p>
<p>wanna believe her</p>
<p>when you watch interviews and</p>
<p>stuff you want to believe her</p>
<p>but the same time it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>something ain&rsquo;t right</p>
<p>hmm something ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right something is not right</p>
<p>i get accused a lot in the comment section of being a</p>
<p>victim blamer</p>
<p>because sometimes i&rsquo;ll call out people like this</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>victim blamer i just</p>
<p>think something ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>you know like damn</p>
<p>anyways so detectives</p>
<p>also interviewed an ex boyfriend of rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who said that when rachel was drunk</p>
<p>so rachel was</p>
<p>drunk one night she was like oh my god</p>
<p>and she accidentally thought that the ex boyfriend</p>
<p>was dan daniel her fiance</p>
<p>and she blurted out</p>
<p>i told you to</p>
<p>burn the body this is what the ex boyfriend testified</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>added level of</p>
<p>creepiness to the</p>
<p>statement because behind the theater</p>
<p>where sam&rsquo;s murder took place</p>
<p>was an old military hospital with a morgue</p>
<p>and an incinerator</p>
<p>rachel she continued</p>
<p>to deny that she had anything to do with the murder</p>
<p>after six years of</p>
<p>trials the da</p>
<p>did not have enough evidence to support a murder charge</p>
<p>but rachel was convicted</p>
<p>of accessory to murder for</p>
<p>lying to police</p>
<p>and sentenced to only thirty two</p>
<p>months in prison</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>steve he feels that justice</p>
<p>was not served</p>
<p>he think or he thought that rachel was let off easy</p>
<p>and she should have been</p>
<p>charged with murder as well</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>guess there&rsquo;s really not much you can</p>
<p>charge her with because there was really no evidence</p>
<p>linking her</p>
<p>to the murder</p>
<p>unless dan want to come out and and</p>
<p>take her down with them you know</p>
<p>so i guess yeah</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m just like really</p>
<p>thinking about it now i&rsquo;m like as much as i i want to</p>
<p>believe that she&rsquo;s involved there&rsquo;s really no evidence</p>
<p>besides her saying like you</p>
<p>should have burned the body</p>
<p>i feel like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t accuse someone on that okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m getting sidetracked so they</p>
<p>ended up having like</p>
<p>200 hearings over the span of six years</p>
<p>and only two</p>
<p>hours of jury deliberation</p>
<p>daniel wozniak</p>
<p>was found guilty on two</p>
<p>counts of first degree murder</p>
<p>and sentenced to capital punishment</p>
<p>in september of</p>
<p>twenty sixteen</p>
<p>currently daniel bozniak is</p>
<p>still waiting on</p>
<p>death row for his sentence to be</p>
<p>carried out</p>
<p>but the likelihood of that happening anytime soon</p>
<p>is like slim to none because</p>
<p>you know there have been challenges over</p>
<p>california&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>and no one has been executed</p>
<p>since two thousand six and there are over</p>
<p>seven hundred and</p>
<p>fifty inmates</p>
<p>on death row at san quentin</p>
<p>where um dan is currently sitting</p>
<p>so the chances of him actually you know he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>going to die in</p>
<p>prison which</p>
<p>i believe that&rsquo;s a fair i believe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worse than the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>do you think that i need to know do you</p>
<p>think that because some people are all</p>
<p>about the death</p>
<p>penalty and i&rsquo;m like look</p>
<p>sitting for the rest of your damn life in prison</p>
<p>that to me sounds way</p>
<p>worse than a</p>
<p>death penalty anyways</p>
<p>rachel and tim have both finished</p>
<p>their sentences</p>
<p>and just continue to live</p>
<p>their life the end</p>
<p>this is what happens when you</p>
<p>are an idiot</p>
<p>what a dumbass what a</p>
<p>selfish piece</p>
<p>of garbage he killed</p>
<p>two people so he can have</p>
<p>money to get</p>
<p>married huh</p>
<p>your wedding is not that special babe</p>
<p>no it ain&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>go get hitched</p>
<p>go to vegas there you go</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re not in prison</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be an</p>
<p>idiot i hate people i cannot believe</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how one day</p>
<p>you can snap and just murder</p>
<p>two people and then dismember them in the attic</p>
<p>like there was no red flags with this guy</p>
<p>really people stress me out i just</p>
<p>and you know what&rsquo;s sad both of</p>
<p>them are actresses or actors and they couldn&rsquo;t even act</p>
<p>they suck i don&rsquo;t know what we can take away from this</p>
<p>other than i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry that people</p>
<p>freaking suck man</p>
<p>julie and sam seems like</p>
<p>just really</p>
<p>great people</p>
<p>that were just</p>
<p>taken and it&rsquo;s not fair</p>
<p>for what for someone&rsquo;s wedding ah</p>
<p>god how dumb</p>
<p>what an idiot oh god what a</p>
<p>stupid what a</p>
<p>stupid man this damn woesnack guy i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stupid and i hope he brought some prison forever</p>
<p>and if the wife was involved</p>
<p>karma karma is real</p>
<p>it really is ma&rsquo;am</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll get you</p>
<p>but only if you did it if you didn&rsquo;t do it then you</p>
<p>should be fine</p>
