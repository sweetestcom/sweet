    <p>Okay, let&rsquo;s fucking try this again.</p>
<p>Hi friends!</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m trying my best to figure out the audio of this fucking podcast because last week&rsquo;s</p>
<p>episode I was holding my phone literally just in my hand the whole time and the audio sounded</p>
<p>like ass for like half of it.</p>
<p>So I have my little phone right now propped up on a little stand above my head and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hoping that the audio is good but like my closet is too big to make it not sound like</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t have enough clothes in here to make it like a padded room because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you need.</p>
<p>Girl, I might as well have to get a fucking microphone and like really actually do a podcast</p>
<p>instead of using my damn phone.</p>
<p>So what I want to talk about this week is motivation and inspiration and a little bit</p>
<p>of how to like stay disciplined when you don&rsquo;t fucking feel like it.</p>
<p>I can do a full podcast episode about self-discipline so I&rsquo;m not going to hit on it too hard.</p>
<p>This one is just going to be about motivation and inspiration because I&rsquo;ve learned a lot</p>
<p>about it and the reason I kind of want to make it two different episodes is because</p>
<p>self-discipline is what&rsquo;s in your control.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s fully dependent upon you.</p>
<p>Motivation and feeling inspired and feeling like energized to do shit, that&rsquo;s a feeling.</p>
<p>You can do things to encourage that but there&rsquo;s no way to guarantee that.</p>
<p>Like self-discipline is guaranteed.</p>
<p>You can make yourself fucking do something regardless but you can&rsquo;t make yourself feel</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to run my mouth about motivation and inspiration in this episode and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do another one on self-discipline if y&rsquo;all want it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start this whole fucking thing off with like me trying to stop drinking.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even get it out of my mouth before I start fucking giggling because I love a</p>
<p>tequila.</p>
<p>We all know this and I don&rsquo;t drink like a daily at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like a drinker drinker but when I drink I drunk bitch.</p>
<p>When I go out I like to drink.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going out to be social I&rsquo;ll go drink but I&rsquo;m very picky about when I drink but</p>
<p>when I drink I drink is my point.</p>
<p>But with my move I knew I wanted to stop drinking.</p>
<p>So I was like alright.</p>
<p>Because I noticed my mood was getting fucked up from drinking.</p>
<p>We all know when you do drugs, like if you do molly or you do coke, your serotonin, all</p>
<p>your feel good chemicals, all your endorphins are fucked for like a couple days until you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>back chemically balanced.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to feel anything good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to feel anything happy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be a depressed piece of shit and probably want to fucking kill yourself.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a come down.</p>
<p>We all know that.</p>
<p>We all know that&rsquo;s what you expect when you do drugs.</p>
<p>Emotionally and physically you&rsquo;re just weak.</p>
<p>So my whole thing was like I quit that shit because it was like fucking with my goals</p>
<p>and it was fucking with my ability to work toward what I want to work toward.</p>
<p>And also I didn&rsquo;t want to spend any extra time in a negative headspace than I needed</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>I never did them routinely but I would do them at like special occasions or a festival</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>You know, just throw a little bit.</p>
<p>You have some fun.</p>
<p>But I got to a point where I was like, fuck it, it ain&rsquo;t worth it.</p>
<p>So I stopped.</p>
<p>So I just allowed myself to drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, all right, I&rsquo;ll just drink.</p>
<p>I can deal with that.</p>
<p>Like I hang over, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>But then after just drinking, I started to notice my mood was still kind of fucked with</p>
<p>even with just drinking.</p>
<p>And then I did some research and I looked into like alcohol and it&rsquo;s kind of a depressant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as severe as like the come down you&rsquo;re going to get from drugs, but like alcohol</p>
<p>the day after it can fuck with your mood.</p>
<p>So I was like, Oh my God, I need to quit drinking.</p>
<p>Like I was like, fuck, like I can&rsquo;t do nothing in this life.</p>
<p>Like I have to go raw dog life.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Like this is not fun.</p>
<p>This is not fair.</p>
<p>So I was like, all right, I&rsquo;m going to try my best throughout this move and through my</p>
<p>new life in Houston.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try my best not to drink because I want to remain in a level headspace as much</p>
<p>as possible because now my job is coaching.</p>
<p>And if I wake up in a bad mood, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not going to let that affect my ability</p>
<p>to help other people.</p>
<p>Like I, that&rsquo;s not a trade off I&rsquo;m willing to make to go get drunk and then be in a bad</p>
<p>mood and not perform for the people that need me.</p>
<p>No, fuck that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll gladly throw away the alcohol to be able to perform good at my job or even just increase</p>
<p>the chances of performing better at my job and having a better mental state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like a side point I want to make really quick about if you know that feeling</p>
<p>motivated is not in your control.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not able to have direct control over if you feel motivated and energized to</p>
<p>do something.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do things that you know are going to fuck with that if you do them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>If I knew drugs are going to decrease my motivation, decrease my will to fucking live basically</p>
<p>and decrease my inspiration, like my goals require me to be inspired and motivated.</p>
<p>And if I want to perform, I&rsquo;m going to do what I can to make sure I&rsquo;m able to perform</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>So like I have to stop doing shit that I know is going to prevent me from performing.</p>
<p>Does that make fucking sense?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more things than just that, that I had to do.</p>
<p>I had to simplify my life a lot too.</p>
<p>Like with my wardrobe, it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very basic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very multiples of the same fucking thing.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have like where I go pick an outfit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I know what I&rsquo;m going to wear for different occasions and it&rsquo;s the same fucking</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m cycling my outfits.</p>
<p>I have multiples of the same thing.</p>
<p>So it simplifies it.</p>
<p>My meals are planned.</p>
<p>Like my life is very like planned out right now because I&rsquo;m tired of wasting my decision</p>
<p>making energy on stupid fucking shit.</p>
<p>Like I need that energy for other things.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve never been more busy in my fucking life.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m happier than ever.</p>
<p>But I moved to Houston to fucking work and like put myself forward and I&rsquo;m doing what</p>
<p>I have to do to remain in a place of motivation.</p>
<p>And like I said, you can&rsquo;t control if you stay in that spot or not, but you can control</p>
<p>the things that you know will knock you out of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a point to all this.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>So with doing that, I was like, all right, I&rsquo;m done drinking.</p>
<p>But then when I moved my first weekend here, I was having a lot of shit go wrong and I</p>
<p>was just like, I want to drink so bad, but I didn&rsquo;t let myself, I was like, I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to drink because I&rsquo;m upset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to allow myself to do that because tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to be fucking pissed that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve let myself drink because I was upset and now I have to deal with like my mood being</p>
<p>fucked up for a day or two, you know?</p>
<p>So I was like, if I&rsquo;m going to drink, it&rsquo;s going to be because of like a happy thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be because I&rsquo;m like upset dealing with all this shit.</p>
<p>So I literally was raw dogging all my problems and I did it and I was great.</p>
<p>But when the weekend came, this girl named Alyssa that I follow on TikTok, she was in</p>
<p>Houston visiting.</p>
<p>So I was like, oh my God, this is the perfect chance to meet.</p>
<p>So like she invited me out with her and her couple of her friends and I was like, oh my</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>I really want to fucking go, but I don&rsquo;t want to drink.</p>
<p>And I was like, Leo, just fucking go drink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your first week here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not upset anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re handling your problems.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like just go have a good time, but just don&rsquo;t drink too much.</p>
<p>I was like, let me test this.</p>
<p>I was like, maybe getting drunk and having a lot of alcohol is what fucks with your mood</p>
<p>the next day.</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;ll go test this out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go like, here&rsquo;s me with my fucking excuses to drink.</p>
<p>But I was like, let me go test this out.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;ll go have a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go be social.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go meet people because that&rsquo;s why I moved.</p>
<p>I wanted to meet people and I was like, okay, Leo, just go have a couple of drinks.</p>
<p>See how you react.</p>
<p>See how you respond.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do coaching calls for a couple of days cause you don&rsquo;t have fucking wifi.</p>
<p>So basically you&rsquo;re fucking free.</p>
<p>Like even if it does fuck your mood up, you ain&rsquo;t got nothing to do because wifi can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come over the weekend.</p>
<p>Like they can&rsquo;t come fix your fucking wall.</p>
<p>So I do have wifi now and I&rsquo;m all fine, but this was just my little mindset I had back</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>I was like, all right.</p>
<p>So I let myself go out.</p>
<p>I had fun.</p>
<p>I met Alyssa.</p>
<p>I met her friends.</p>
<p>We were meeting each other for the first time.</p>
<p>Like she wasn&rsquo;t tight with the people she was meeting.</p>
<p>Like she had just met them and then I was meeting all of them for the first time.</p>
<p>But like when we all hung out, we fucking just clicked immediately and it scares the</p>
<p>shit out of me because I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ve never been so comfortable with someone so fast and</p>
<p>like not had my trust issues flare up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what the fuck is going on with these goddamn people?</p>
<p>But I went out, I drank, I drank a little bit more than I wanted to, but I didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>like drunk.</p>
<p>Like I was just having a good fucking time.</p>
<p>I was okay.</p>
<p>We had a fucking blast.</p>
<p>I absolutely am so happy I went.</p>
<p>So at the end of the night, me, Alyssa and Randy agreed, okay, tomorrow we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>go to the gym.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, perfect.</p>
<p>I need something to get me out of bed cause I&rsquo;m going to be fucking like sad is what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, all right, I need something to like get my mind off of it.</p>
<p>So I go home, I wake up, it&rsquo;s the next day, it&rsquo;s Sunday.</p>
<p>First day hungover.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel all that awful.</p>
<p>Like I took my little hydration packs.</p>
<p>I took my vitamins.</p>
<p>I was okay.</p>
<p>And then I noticed my mood was not off at all.</p>
<p>Like I was so excited to get out of the fucking bed and go hang out with my new friends.</p>
<p>I went to go meet them for coffee and then we went to the gym and like bro, my mood was</p>
<p>not fucked with at all.</p>
<p>I was so happy.</p>
<p>Like I was so convinced myself that like if I drink, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to feel</p>
<p>good emotions for two days.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The place I used to live in and where I used to be and how I used to be mentally is why</p>
<p>I was upset and unhappy with my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like once I moved here and I was around people hanging out, going to a gym, we went</p>
<p>to fucking alpha land.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know what alpha land is, it&rsquo;s the biggest gym, like it&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>influencer gym.</p>
<p>Like everybody that is somebody goes there and it was very intimidating and it was a</p>
<p>really fucking lot to take in because everybody was hot.</p>
<p>Every time I turned around, I was like the ugly one and I&rsquo;m not used to that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m used to being like one of the cutest ones in the room and like there</p>
<p>I was like very much average Joe Schmo.</p>
<p>All I had going for me was that I was tall and that&rsquo;s not common for me.</p>
<p>So I was very much insecure, but I had a fucking blast.</p>
<p>I met some cool ass fucking people.</p>
<p>I got to hang out with my new friends and the whole day was just beautiful.</p>
<p>Like I had so much fun.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sad once.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sad at all.</p>
<p>Cat, be quiet.</p>
<p>Inside voice, library voice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m recording a podcast.</p>
<p>So this made me look at everything like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like literally what the fuck?</p>
<p>Why was I so happy to get out of bed?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m supposed to be fucked up in the head today because of the alcohol, you know?</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t because I actually was around people I wanted to be around.</p>
<p>I was doing things I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I was doing things that excited me and I was with people that pushed me and I was with</p>
<p>people that had the same goals in mind.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m used to running off of straight, just fucking pure self-discipline and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very, very hard like to do things alone, to be by yourself, to just run off of self-discipline</p>
<p>and just push yourself.</p>
<p>It is 10 times harder to do shit from that place and you are going to need to feel motivated</p>
<p>more than ever when it&rsquo;s a situation like that.</p>
<p>Everything seems 10 times fucking harder and it&rsquo;s just so difficult when you&rsquo;re alone or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not like inspired or motivated.</p>
<p>And this is not me in any way saying that alcohol is not bad for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying what I thought alcohol was doing to me was not what was really going</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>It was kind of like exacerbating what I already wasn&rsquo;t happy with and because I was living</p>
<p>my life before, very no one around me working toward what I was working toward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never worked out with someone since my fucking stepdad died.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have a gym partner.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a gym buddy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anyone doing shit with me.</p>
<p>Like my life at home in Pensacola was very just like me and I was secluded.</p>
<p>I was by myself, but being around new people, being around people that were driven, having</p>
<p>friends to go to the gym with, we pushed each other.</p>
<p>We had a great fucking workout.</p>
<p>We took pictures and it was just like the best fucking day.</p>
<p>Alcohol only made me feel bad when I wasn&rsquo;t happy with my life.</p>
<p>The fact that I was happy with my life and what I was doing the next day, I didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>notice if I was chemically imbalanced is my thing.</p>
<p>There was so many little things going on that made me so happy that like there was no sadness</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going with this, but like I have other points to get to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so shocked because it&rsquo;s such a little thing.</p>
<p>Like just having people around you and being in a different city, like being in Houston</p>
<p>is so like motivating itself.</p>
<p>Just like being in a big city with big buildings and people and it&rsquo;s like, go, go, go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like everyone&rsquo;s always around and everyone&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t think it would be that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t think it would make this big of an impact on me, but it&rsquo;s literally changing</p>
<p>everything for me.</p>
<p>My motivation level, my mood, my inspiration, my hope, my everything.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m literally not sleeping near as much as I used to sleep and I&rsquo;m easily getting</p>
<p>up in the morning because I&rsquo;m excited to go do shit and I&rsquo;m excited to work on what</p>
<p>I have to work on.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just this weird natural progression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not having to force myself to feel motivated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not having to every day talk myself into doing the things I know I need to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just excited to do them.</p>
<p>I still just can&rsquo;t wrap my mind around how easy it is, like how simple it is to feel</p>
<p>motivated and inspired.</p>
<p>Like who fucking knew your surroundings played this much of an impact?</p>
<p>Like I genuinely just want to better the fuck out of myself and like I&rsquo;m so excited</p>
<p>to share things with them and like move forward and progress because it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m around</p>
<p>people that are also like doing shit and achieving shit and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s making me want to</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Big cities in Houston especially is full of people that are fucking like going toward</p>
<p>what they want, but they&rsquo;re not just going toward it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fucking running.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everyone around you is sprinting for what they want.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like running for it.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re the one standing there walking, you&rsquo;re like looking around like why the fuck</p>
<p>is everybody running?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like oh my god I guess I should run and you get motivated to run and it&rsquo;s like now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sprinting toward your fucking goals and that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at now and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>visual I can give you to explain the energy shift in me just by moving to a bigger city,</p>
<p>just by going out and meeting some new people and just seeing what the fuck I could see.</p>
<p>I finally feel motivated and inspired and I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s just a fucking temporary</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Like this is very much sticking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gone away in a fucking week.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m still the same level of inspired when I shouldn&rsquo;t be like given what I thought</p>
<p>the problem was which is alcohol making me upset and sad and not excited and not nothing.</p>
<p>Like it was my life that was doing that.</p>
<p>It was my surroundings and where I had myself and who I was around that was doing that.</p>
<p>My big point is it&rsquo;s very easy to be uninspired in average places but you have to go where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the misfit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how I explained I was the one walking here and everybody&rsquo;s running and then it made</p>
<p>me start running.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re in the town or if you&rsquo;re in a place or you&rsquo;re around people that are</p>
<p>all walking and you want to run, no one&rsquo;s going to push you to run because all they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is walking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be so hard and take so much more effort for you to push yourself to run</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re around people who are just walking.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not going to feel good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel more alone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel more isolated.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel dragged down and not uplifted because everybody walking is just</p>
<p>fucking moseying around.</p>
<p>That drags you down.</p>
<p>That like makes you feel okay doing the bare minimum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like even if you just jog one day, you still feel accomplished because everyone around</p>
<p>you in comparison is just walking.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re fucking walking in a city or in a place or around people who are sprinting,</p>
<p>just jogging is not enough.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sprinting to that, you&rsquo;re not shit.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re not sprinting, you&rsquo;re not satisfied.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to sprint around people who are sprinting and I&rsquo;m going to fucking just</p>
<p>leave it there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cause I keep running around that topic.</p>
<p>But my next little point is finding an accountability partner or someone that like is there with</p>
<p>you cause I cannot tell you how big it is to just have someone there with you and checking</p>
<p>in on you, checking in with you, you holding them accountable, them holding you accountable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this weird thing of like when you start talking to someone who is also working</p>
<p>hard, you feel instantly inspired when they&rsquo;re doing something you want to do too.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re at the bottom with you and they&rsquo;re working their way up like you guys</p>
<p>working toward it together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like for you to associate yourself with someone who is working, it makes you want</p>
<p>more for yourself and it makes you push yourself and it helps you push yourself to associate</p>
<p>yourself with that person.</p>
<p>Like if I want to be friends with this person, if I&rsquo;m working with this person, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be this lazy piece of shit that I was before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we got to keep each other going and I can&rsquo;t tell you how much of a difference</p>
<p>that makes.</p>
<p>So a way to do that is like find a fucking coach.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working on the gym or whatever, find a fucking personal trainer, find that</p>
<p>accountability coach, find people online like there&rsquo;s literally so many groups on Facebook</p>
<p>of accountability partners or just find someone on Instagram or text one of your friends that</p>
<p>you see is very, very serious about it and be like, yo, I want to be accountability partners</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to fucking love it.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>But you, like I said, associating yourself with someone that&rsquo;s like very driven, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to make you feel driven because you&rsquo;re comparing yourself now to someone that&rsquo;s sprinting,</p>
<p>not someone that&rsquo;s walking.</p>
<p>You can also hire a fucking life coach.</p>
<p>People that will check in with you daily.</p>
<p>People have programs for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a coach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do sessions with you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing is like if you know you have a call with me every week, then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to know throughout the week, oh fuck, if I want to be able to admit what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>to Leo and like tell him good things, I have to do them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way you could do it with me.</p>
<p>But there are other coaches that will text you daily and we&rsquo;ll check in with you daily</p>
<p>and make sure you got all your shit done.</p>
<p>So it just depends what works for you, what you want, but there&rsquo;s options out there.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re feeling unmotivated, please just literally listen to what I&rsquo;m saying because</p>
<p>I was in the same position.</p>
<p>Okay, so going on the motivation, my next point about that is about checking in with</p>
<p>yourself to seeing what makes you feel energized.</p>
<p>So a lot of people don&rsquo;t know what they should be doing.</p>
<p>But my biggest tip for that is go after and follow what makes you feel energized.</p>
<p>So just start paying attention to what gives you a boost.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is like, if you&rsquo;re just sitting down and then you think about</p>
<p>doing something and you&rsquo;re just like normal, normal, whatever, you have these little ideas</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden you think of something that makes you sit up, Oh my God, wait, that</p>
<p>caught your attention.</p>
<p>If the boost of energy just made you sit up, like, so pay attention to whatever makes you</p>
<p>feel energized and then fucking follow that.</p>
<p>So literally like when you&rsquo;re just thinking thoughts, whatever thought makes you like</p>
<p>open your eyes wider or sit up a little straighter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a boost of energy right there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening in your body.</p>
<p>Follow that.</p>
<p>Go act on whatever that is because that&rsquo;s a natural motivation that&rsquo;s going to continue</p>
<p>to come.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something going on intrinsically with you that&rsquo;s pulling you toward that.</p>
<p>And if you work on something that you are naturally already feeling pulled toward and</p>
<p>to do, it will be a lot easier to do that than if you have something that you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>logically like, okay, I know I need to do this, but I really just don&rsquo;t fucking feel</p>
<p>like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to do that stuff.</p>
<p>But if you can help yourself find the things and do the things that make you feel energized</p>
<p>as you do more of it, your energy will not deplete.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing the things that you feel good doing and the things that you want to</p>
<p>do, you don&rsquo;t need motivation to do them and then it will just cycle and it will just build.</p>
<p>So you will have more energy and you will feel more accomplished and more esteemed and</p>
<p>ready to face and handle the shit that you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>Like I swear it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, but it does make sense.</p>
<p>Like logically you&rsquo;re like, okay, sure.</p>
<p>Until it happens and you do it and you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, Leo was fucking right.</p>
<p>And one other way you can kind of look at that, like another perspective you can take</p>
<p>on finding what makes you feel energized, do what you can feel valuable doing.</p>
<p>Like do the things that you can feel useful while you do it.</p>
<p>Because it takes no motivation to provide value when it feels good to do it.</p>
<p>Like providing value is reassuring to yourself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t not feel good while you&rsquo;re providing value to anything or anyone.</p>
<p>Like as long as you&rsquo;re contributing, you&rsquo;re being of use.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re feeling useful as a human being, you are not wired to feel negative</p>
<p>in that moment.</p>
<p>You cannot, sorry, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So go about the whole energized thing.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t feel like you know anything that&rsquo;s making you feel energized and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not able to observe that, just start thinking, where can I be of use?</p>
<p>Where could I feel useful or where could I contribute value?</p>
<p>Like how could I contribute value in any way?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this podcast.</p>
<p>I look at it like I just want to share awareness.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m trying to offer things that are of use to other people.</p>
<p>And whenever I&rsquo;m like, fuck, I don&rsquo;t want to go sit down and make a fucking podcast</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, Leo, your only goal is to share awareness.</p>
<p>So how can you do that?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll sit down and I&rsquo;m like, I really just don&rsquo;t fucking feel like it right now.</p>
<p>Like whatever.</p>
<p>Like, and I&rsquo;ll literally start making a list of like little points I could bring up.</p>
<p>And by making that list and thinking of the ways that I could contribute value, it makes</p>
<p>me feel energized.</p>
<p>And the list gets longer and longer and longer than I have to fucking redo it.</p>
<p>Because now I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m ready to go provide the value.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m ready to go record the episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally recording this at 10pm.</p>
<p>Because I just got this burst of like, I&rsquo;m so fucking excited to come in here and talk</p>
<p>about this shit.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not even just talking about this shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s providing value.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m providing value in a way that I&rsquo;ve found that I like and that I&rsquo;m good at and is relatively</p>
<p>easy.</p>
<p>Like I just come in here and talk to my fucking phone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s gone into me learning how to articulate what I&rsquo;m thinking and feeling</p>
<p>and learning how to explain things the way that I do.</p>
<p>My whole point is once I switch my focus from looking at a task like, oh, I need to put</p>
<p>out a podcast for this week because Sunday&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I need to go record one.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at it like a task that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I look at it like an opportunity that I can provide value or share something.</p>
<p>And another way you can ask yourself that is asking what is trying to express itself</p>
<p>through me.</p>
<p>Like whenever you&rsquo;re feeling anything, just ask yourself that that&rsquo;s kind of like weird</p>
<p>off on a tangent, but it came out of my mouth for a reason.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just going to run with it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s something I use a lot is whenever I&rsquo;m feeling like lost or confused or whatever.</p>
<p>If like if I feel a weird feeling come up, I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s trying to express itself</p>
<p>through me?</p>
<p>Or if I have an urge to go talk to somebody or tell somebody something or call somebody</p>
<p>or interact with, like if I feel called toward anyone, I think for a second and I ask myself,</p>
<p>what is trying to express itself through me?</p>
<p>And it opens up my eyes to so much shit.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s a key way to find the value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s trying to express itself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something valuable coming out of you.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s trying to come out of you for a reason.</p>
<p>So when you tap into it and you try to understand it, and then you realize what it is and you</p>
<p>realize how you can go express it and provide that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel that boost of motivation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel that energy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not going to be like, Oh, I drank coffee and now I have a little energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this weird, real energy, like a fucking soul energy where it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s no type of stimulant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like something&rsquo;s pushing you forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even pushing you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you just got this like surge of like, like I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>You can feel it through your whole body.</p>
<p>Because like, I was tired a little bit ago and then I thought about the podcast.</p>
<p>I literally was like, okay, I&rsquo;m just going to sit down and write out my list and organize</p>
<p>my thoughts of like the little points that I want to hit and I&rsquo;ll record the podcast</p>
<p>tomorrow.</p>
<p>And by making the list, I tapped into that, what I could contribute.</p>
<p>And here I am recording the podcast immediately as I wrote the list because I was so inspired.</p>
<p>I was so ready to do it, but it beat sleep.</p>
<p>Like I was fucking dog ass tired about to fall asleep at my desk earlier.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve got myself to start doing the little list and the like it ignited in me</p>
<p>and like here I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not tired at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing is the motivation will come after you start.</p>
<p>So if you, as long as you can make yourself focus in one direction for a second and you</p>
<p>can just force your energy toward one thing, as soon as you start to focus on it, it will</p>
<p>just start unfolding and the energy and like the motivation will heighten and it will just</p>
<p>snowball.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just a matter of like initially forcing yourself to do something you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>fucking do.</p>
<p>Like when I was sitting there tired, I was like, I don&rsquo;t want to make this fucking list.</p>
<p>And then I started thinking of all the realizations I&rsquo;ve been having and I was like, you know</p>
<p>what?</p>
<p>All right, let me just start writing some shit and then it just snowballed.</p>
<p>So yes, that&rsquo;s my big point with all of this one is do what you can feel useful doing or</p>
<p>provide value in a way that you can provide value.</p>
<p>And also if you want to talk law of attraction for a second, when you&rsquo;re in a place of trying</p>
<p>to provide or give or share, that comes from a place of abundance.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not going to be able to be in an energy of lack and energy of like being drained.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be out of energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be full of energy when you&rsquo;re trying to provide.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kind of turned my back on the whole law of attraction thing.</p>
<p>Like I use it as a way to stay stagnant for a long time and I have a lot of like anger</p>
<p>toward it.</p>
<p>But I do have a deep understanding of the law of attraction and energies and frequencies</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve just gotten very rooted in the physical and I&rsquo;m just letting, I see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unfolding energetically.</p>
<p>I see how I&rsquo;m becoming a match to meeting these people, having these experiences, moving,</p>
<p>acting on the urges and like all the things that I&rsquo;m doing, I see how the law of attraction</p>
<p>is at work, but I&rsquo;m just kind of ignoring it because I&rsquo;m like, no bitch, I&rsquo;m done sitting</p>
<p>around trying to manifest things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fucking do it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m done asking the universe for shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done asking people for shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll fucking do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get the fuck up and do it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry because you&rsquo;ve let me down too many times, me trying to manifest it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing is like when you fall in that trap of trying to manifest things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going to feel motivated in that spot of when you&rsquo;re asking for things.</p>
<p>When you get up and you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m going to go do this, I&rsquo;m going to go create this.</p>
<p>When you stand in your power, you&rsquo;re motivated.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re not in your power, you&rsquo;re not motivated.</p>
<p>My last point to drive all this fucking home.</p>
<p>If you are the best in the room, you&rsquo;re in the wrong room.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m used to walking in the gym and I&rsquo;m one of the best looking ones there.</p>
<p>Like where I was in Pensacola, I was like one of the best looking ones always.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re one of the best in the room, your inspiration will drain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re playing a video game.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re playing Grand Theft Auto.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a challenge and you want to keep playing while you&rsquo;re earning all the weapons, while</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building yourself up, while you&rsquo;re building your skill set and his cars and his</p>
<p>collection and all his shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re building things and you&rsquo;re doing the missions, you&rsquo;re more inspired</p>
<p>and more inclined to keep going.</p>
<p>But once you get all the cheat codes and you&rsquo;re able to have a fucking rocket launcher and</p>
<p>shoot down anything, shoot a helicopter down, you can shoot all the cops, you can make yourself</p>
<p>invincible and you can&rsquo;t die.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before you get bored and turn off the game.</p>
<p>Like once you&rsquo;re the best in the game, once there&rsquo;s no way to level up, once there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>more challenge, it&rsquo;s fucking boring and your inspiration is going to dwindle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same thing about real life.</p>
<p>Like if you keep going into places where you&rsquo;re one of the best in the room, your inspiration</p>
<p>will soon drain because at first it&rsquo;s going to be like, Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>Like, Ooh, I feel so good about being one of the cutest ones here.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re not being challenged, it&rsquo;s not fun anymore.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;ll be fun for a minute, but not enough minutes to keep you fucking going.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going to be looking for more and it&rsquo;s just going to get difficult.</p>
<p>So you want to go to the place where you&rsquo;re the minority.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically like where you&rsquo;re not the best in the room.</p>
<p>You need to go to the next level.</p>
<p>So once you get comfortable on one level and you&rsquo;re like, Hey, like I&rsquo;m doing pretty good.</p>
<p>Enjoy it for a minute.</p>
<p>Enjoy having all the cheat codes on that level.</p>
<p>Enjoy having the rocket launcher.</p>
<p>And then once you notice your inspiration starts to drain and starts to go down and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not inspired and you&rsquo;re just kind of like, uh, like I&rsquo;m bored.</p>
<p>As soon as you have that sense of like, all right, I&rsquo;m a little bored now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your sign.</p>
<p>You need to go to the next level.</p>
<p>You need to go to the next room where you&rsquo;re not the best because you&rsquo;re not being pushed.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re one of the best in the room, people aren&rsquo;t challenging you.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t pushing you.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t inspiring you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re the source of inspiration for others, where&rsquo;s your inspiration in the</p>
<p>next room?</p>
<p>So you have to go if you want to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>I hope I did a good job of explaining that one because that one&rsquo;s fucking weird.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But my example of this is going to that fucking gym.</p>
<p>Like bro, going to Alphaland made me want to just, I was like, excuse the fuck out of</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go home and eat nothing but air for the next week, bro.</p>
<p>Like I felt like a fat fucking cow.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m in good shape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in good shape compared to normal people.</p>
<p>Like I look really good compared to normal people.</p>
<p>I look good.</p>
<p>I look fit.</p>
<p>But in the gym full of all of the best of the best, I was the fucking ugly one.</p>
<p>Like I was the duff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m being fucking dramatic.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But like, I felt so like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>But being in that gym made me like, oh hell no.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t eating nothing but rice and broccoli and chicken for the next fucking year.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not touching a single bad fucking food, any type of chocolate.</p>
<p>Get the fuck away from me.</p>
<p>Like I was so inspired.</p>
<p>Like I was so insecure and so humbled that I was inspired to like, no more fucking around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s game time.</p>
<p>Like now that I&rsquo;m playing in this gym, now that I&rsquo;m on this field, there&rsquo;s no more like</p>
<p>peewee level shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you about to get the fuck up on this level.</p>
<p>And it like pushed me and like, I have not binged.</p>
<p>I have not had a cheat meal.</p>
<p>I have not eaten bad.</p>
<p>Like bitch, I&rsquo;m on my shit right now for like a whole week straight.</p>
<p>And like being around those people is what did it.</p>
<p>But I was binging and I was like fucking myself up at my old gym where I was one of</p>
<p>the cutest ones there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s easy to go home and binge because like, even if I binge, then I look</p>
<p>bloated tomorrow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still going to show up and look better than most of the people there.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not on that level at Alphaland y&rsquo;all like I can&rsquo;t be fucking eating bad.</p>
<p>Like if I show up bloated, I&rsquo;m ugly.</p>
<p>If I show up bloated, they&rsquo;re going to fucking throw me out.</p>
<p>They would never like, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But I feel like you&rsquo;re getting the point that I&rsquo;m making, but I&rsquo;m very, very inspired with</p>
<p>the gym that I went to Alphaland like girl, I can&rsquo;t fucking explain to you.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m so pumped.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so motivated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m pushing myself so hard now, but it&rsquo;s funny cause I&rsquo;m not even, I don&rsquo;t even feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m pushing myself.</p>
<p>Like I just, I&rsquo;m so ready to fucking run like bitch, I&rsquo;m ready to sprint and I&rsquo;m not having</p>
<p>to force myself to sprint.</p>
<p>And this is the first time this has ever happened in like a really fucking long time.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to share all the little mindset shifts and all the things that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>with this, but also with career wise, like the people that I&rsquo;m friends with now, everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on their shit.</p>
<p>Like everybody&rsquo;s like networking and doing their thing and building their businesses</p>
<p>and building their followings.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, Oh my God, here I go.</p>
<p>Like, let me go get on my shit real quick.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mind me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so nice to be around people who are also running.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>If you like this podcast, I just have one request and it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a five</p>
<p>star rating.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>If you want to keep up with me, all of my social media will be linked in the description</p>
<p>of this podcast.</p>
<p>Also if you are interested in one-on-one coaching with me, I have now created an application</p>
<p>process so it&rsquo;s no longer just free to schedule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing applications now to keep up with the demand because it just got too high.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m screening people basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit and who&rsquo;s not because I want</p>
<p>to work with action takers.</p>
<p>I want to work with people that are serious about transforming their life because the</p>
<p>shit that I say, y&rsquo;all know that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>And where I specialize is with the people that have been looking for answers they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find and the people that have been trying shit and it&rsquo;s just not working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in that, I will put the link to the application in the description</p>
<p>box also.</p>
<p>And I want to make it very clear that you&rsquo;ve already got what it takes to get through what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with or to improve your life or to reach your goals.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll help you see that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be a lot easier when you got me in your corner because that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>how I want it to feel.</p>
<p>I want it to feel like you have someone that has your back and like I&rsquo;m in your corner</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m there for you and I&rsquo;m there to do shit with you.</p>
<p>But anyways, thank you so much for listening.</p>
<p>Please stay safe and take care of yourself and I will talk to you next Sunday.</p>
