    <p>The following is a conversation with Travis Oliphant,</p>
<p>one of the most impactful programmers</p>
<p>and data scientists ever.</p>
<p>He created NumPy, SciPy, and Anaconda.</p>
<p>NumPy formed the foundation</p>
<p>of tensor based machine learning in Python,</p>
<p>SciPy formed the foundation</p>
<p>of scientific programming in Python,</p>
<p>and Anaconda, specifically with Conda,</p>
<p>made Python more accessible to a much larger audience.</p>
<p>Travis&rsquo;s life work across a large number of programming</p>
<p>and entrepreneurial efforts has and will continue</p>
<p>to have immeasurable impact on millions of lives</p>
<p>by empowering scientists and engineers</p>
<p>in big companies, small companies,</p>
<p>and open source communities to take on difficult problems</p>
<p>and solve them with the power of programming.</p>
<p>Plus, he&rsquo;s a truly kind human being,</p>
<p>which is something that when combined with vision</p>
<p>and ambition makes for a great leader</p>
<p>and a great person to chat with.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Travis Oliphant.</p>
<p>What was the first computer program you&rsquo;ve ever written?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>Whoa, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I think it was in fourth grade.</p>
<p>Just a simple loop in BASIC.</p>
<p>BASIC. BASIC, yeah, on an Atari 800,</p>
<p>Atari 400, I think, or maybe it was an Atari 800.</p>
<p>It was a part of a class,</p>
<p>and we just were just BASIC loops to print things out.</p>
<p>Did you use go to statements?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, we used go to statements.</p>
<p>I remember in the early days,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I first realized</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like principles to programming,</p>
<p>when I was told that don&rsquo;t use go to statements.</p>
<p>Those are bad software engineering principles,</p>
<p>like it goes against what great, beautiful code is.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, okay, there&rsquo;s rules to this game.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see that until high school</p>
<p>when I took an AP computer science course.</p>
<p>I did a lot of other kinds of just programming in TI,</p>
<p>but finally, when I took an AP computer science course</p>
<p>in Pascal.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, yeah, it was Pascal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I, oh, there are these principles.</p>
<p>Not C or C++?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t take C until the next year in college.</p>
<p>I had a course in C, but I haven&rsquo;t done much in Pascal,</p>
<p>just that AP computer science course.</p>
<p>Now, sorry for the romanticized question,</p>
<p>but when did you first fall in love with programming?</p>
<p>Oh, man, good question.</p>
<p>I think actually when I was 10,</p>
<p>my dad got us a TI Timex Sinclair,</p>
<p>and he was excited about the spreadsheet capability,</p>
<p>and then, but I made him get the basic,</p>
<p>the add ons we could actually program in basic,</p>
<p>and just being able to write instructions</p>
<p>and have the computer do something.</p>
<p>Then we got a TI 994A when I was about 12,</p>
<p>and I would just, it had sprites and graphics and music.</p>
<p>You could actually program it to do music.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I really sort of fell in love with programming.</p>
<p>So this is a full, like a real computer</p>
<p>with like, with memory and storage,</p>
<p>processors and whatnot,</p>
<p>because you say TI. Yeah, the Timex Sinclair</p>
<p>was one of the very first, it was a cheap, cheap,</p>
<p>like, I think it was, well, it was still expensive,</p>
<p>but it was 2K of memory.</p>
<p>We got the 16K add on pack,</p>
<p>but yeah, it had memory, and you could program it.</p>
<p>You had the, in order to store your programs,</p>
<p>you had to attach a tape drive.</p>
<p>Remember that old, the sound that would play</p>
<p>when you converted the modems would convert digital bits</p>
<p>to audio files set on a tape drive.</p>
<p>Still remember that sound, but that was the storage.</p>
<p>And what was the programming language, do you remember?</p>
<p>It was basic. It was basic.</p>
<p>And then they had a VisiCalc,</p>
<p>and so a little bit of spreadsheet programming</p>
<p>in VisiCalc, but mostly just some basic.</p>
<p>Do you remember what kind of things drew you to programming?</p>
<p>Was it working with data, was it video games?</p>
<p>Games, math, mathy stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve always loved math,</p>
<p>and a lot of people think they don&rsquo;t like math</p>
<p>because I think when they&rsquo;re exposed to it early,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about memory.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re exposed to math early,</p>
<p>you have a good short term memory,</p>
<p>can remember his timetables.</p>
<p>And I do have a reasonably, I mean, not perfect,</p>
<p>but a reasonably long little short term memory buffer.</p>
<p>And so I did great at timetables.</p>
<p>I said, oh, I&rsquo;m good at math.</p>
<p>But I started to really like math,</p>
<p>just the problem solving aspect.</p>
<p>And so computing was problem solving applied.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s always kind of been the draw,</p>
<p>kind of coupled with the mathematics.</p>
<p>Did you ever see the computer as like an extension</p>
<p>of your mind, like something able to achieve?</p>
<p>Not till later.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, not then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a little set of puzzles</p>
<p>that you can play with and you can play with math puzzles.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was too rudimentary early on.</p>
<p>Like it was sort of, yeah, it was a lot of work</p>
<p>to actually take a thought you&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>and actually get it implemented.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still work, but it&rsquo;s getting easier.</p>
<p>And so yeah, I would say that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s attracting me to Python</p>
<p>is that that was more real, right?</p>
<p>I could think in Python.</p>
<p>Speaking of foreign language,</p>
<p>I only speak another language fluently besides English,</p>
<p>which is Spanish.</p>
<p>And I remember the day when I would dream in Spanish</p>
<p>and you start to think in that language.</p>
<p>And then you actually, I do definitely believe</p>
<p>that language limits or expands your thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some languages that actually lead you</p>
<p>to certain thought processes.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, so I speak Russian fluently</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s certainly a language that leads you</p>
<p>down certain thought processes.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a history</p>
<p>of the two world wars of millions of people starving</p>
<p>to death or near to death throughout its history</p>
<p>of suffering, of injustice, like this promise sold</p>
<p>to the people and then the carpet</p>
<p>or whatever is swept from under them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like broken promises.</p>
<p>And all of that pain and melancholy is in the language,</p>
<p>the sad songs, the sad hopeful songs,</p>
<p>the over romanticized, like, I love you, I hate you,</p>
<p>the sort of the swings between all the various spectrums</p>
<p>of emotion, so that&rsquo;s all within the language.</p>
<p>The way it&rsquo;s twisted, there&rsquo;s a strong culture</p>
<p>of rhyming poetry, so like the bards,</p>
<p>like the sync, there&rsquo;s a musicality to the language too.</p>
<p>Did Dostoevsky write in Russian?</p>
<p>Yeah, so like Dostoevsky, Tostoy, all the,</p>
<p>all the.</p>
<p>The ones that I know about, which are translated</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m curious how the translations.</p>
<p>So Dostoevsky did not use the musicality</p>
<p>of the language too much.</p>
<p>So it actually translates pretty well</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so philosophically dense</p>
<p>that the story does a lot of the work,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a bunch of things that are untranslatable.</p>
<p>Certainly the poetry is not translatable.</p>
<p>I actually have a few conversations coming up offline</p>
<p>and also in this podcast with people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve translated Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for people who worked, who work in this field,</p>
<p>know how difficult that is.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can spend months thinking</p>
<p>about a single sentence, right?</p>
<p>In context, like, cause there&rsquo;s just the magic</p>
<p>captured by that sentence and how do you translate</p>
<p>just in the right way?</p>
<p>Because those words can be really powerful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous line,</p>
<p>beauty will save the world from Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so many ways to translate that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, the language gives you the tools</p>
<p>with which to tell the story,</p>
<p>but it also leads your mind down certain trajectories</p>
<p>and paths to where over time,</p>
<p>as you think in that language,</p>
<p>you become a different human being.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a fascinating reality, I think.</p>
<p>I know people have explored that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just rediscovered.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t, we live in our own like little pockets.</p>
<p>Like this is the sad thing is I feel like unfortunately,</p>
<p>given time and given getting older,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never know China, the Chinese world,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t truly know the language.</p>
<p>Same with Japanese, I don&rsquo;t truly know Japanese</p>
<p>and Portuguese and Brazil,</p>
<p>that whole South American continent.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I&rsquo;ll go to Brazil and Argentina,</p>
<p>but will I truly understand the people</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t understand the language?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad because I wonder how much,</p>
<p>how many geniuses were missing</p>
<p>because so much of the scientific world,</p>
<p>so much of the technical world is in English,</p>
<p>and so much of it might be lost</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just we don&rsquo;t have the common language.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much in that vein of there&rsquo;s a lot of genius</p>
<p>out there that we miss,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of fortunate when it bubbles up</p>
<p>into something that we can understand or process,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot we miss.</p>
<p>So I tend to lean towards really loving democratization</p>
<p>or things that empower people</p>
<p>or very resistant sort of authoritarian structures.</p>
<p>Fundamentally for that reason,</p>
<p>well, several reasons, but it just hurts us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re soft.</p>
<p>So speaking of languages that empower you,</p>
<p>so Python was the first language for me</p>
<p>that I really enjoyed thinking in, as you said.</p>
<p>Sounds like you shared my experience too.</p>
<p>So when did you first,</p>
<p>do you remember when you first kind of connected with Python,</p>
<p>maybe even fell in love with Python?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>It was a process.</p>
<p>It took about a year.</p>
<p>I first encountered Python in 1997.</p>
<p>I was a graduate student studying biomedical engineering</p>
<p>at the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>And I had previously,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been involved in taking information from satellites.</p>
<p>I was an electrical engineering student</p>
<p>used to taking information</p>
<p>and trying to get something out of it,</p>
<p>doing some data processing, getting information out of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d done that in MATLAB.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d done that in Perl.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d done that in scripting on a VMS.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a VAX VMS system,</p>
<p>they had their own little scripting tools around Fortran.</p>
<p>Done a lot of that.</p>
<p>And then as a graduate student,</p>
<p>I was looking for something and encountered Python.</p>
<p>And because Python had an array,</p>
<p>had two things that made me not filter it away.</p>
<p>Because I was filtering a bunch of stuff,</p>
<p>as Yorick, I looked at Yorick,</p>
<p>I looked at a few other languages that are out there</p>
<p>at the time in 1997, but it had arrays.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a library called Numeric</p>
<p>that had just been written in 95,</p>
<p>like not very, not too much earlier.</p>
<p>By an MIT alum, Jim Huganen.</p>
<p>You know, and I went back and read the mailing list</p>
<p>to see the history of how it grew.</p>
<p>And there was a very interesting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to do that actually,</p>
<p>to see how this emergent cooperation,</p>
<p>unstructured cooperation happens in the open source world</p>
<p>that led to a lot of this collective programming,</p>
<p>which is something maybe we might get into a little later,</p>
<p>but what that looks like.</p>
<p>What gap did Numeric fill?</p>
<p>Numeric filled the gap of having an array object.</p>
<p>There was no array object.</p>
<p>There was no array.</p>
<p>There was a one dimensional byte concept,</p>
<p>but there was no n dimensional,</p>
<p>two, three, four dimensional tensor they call it now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in the category that a tensor is another thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just an ndarray we should call it,</p>
<p>but kind of lost that battle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many battles in this world,</p>
<p>some of which we win, some we lose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So, but it had no math to it.</p>
<p>So Numeric had math and a basic way to think in arrays.</p>
<p>So I was looking for that,</p>
<p>and it had complex numbers,</p>
<p>a lot of programming languages.</p>
<p>And you can see it because,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just a computer scientist,</p>
<p>you think, ah, complex numbers are just two floats.</p>
<p>So you can, people can build that on.</p>
<p>But in practice, a complex number</p>
<p>as one of the significant algebras</p>
<p>that helps connect a lot of physical</p>
<p>and mathematical ideas,</p>
<p>particularly FFT for an electrical engineer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really important concept</p>
<p>and not having it means you have to develop it</p>
<p>several times and those times may not share an approach.</p>
<p>One of the common things in programming,</p>
<p>one of the things programming enables is abstractions.</p>
<p>But when you have shared abstractions, it&rsquo;s even better.</p>
<p>It sort of gets to the level of language</p>
<p>of actually we all think of this the same way,</p>
<p>which is both powerful and dangerous, right?</p>
<p>Because powerful in that we now can quickly</p>
<p>make bigger and higher level things</p>
<p>on top of those abstractions dangerous</p>
<p>because it also limits us as to the things</p>
<p>we maybe left behind in producing that abstraction,</p>
<p>which is at the heart of programming today</p>
<p>and actually building around the programming world.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fascinating philosophical topic.</p>
<p>Yeah, they will continue for many years, I think.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll continue for many years.</p>
<p>As we build more and more and more abstractions.</p>
<p>Yes, I often think about, you know,</p>
<p>we have a world that&rsquo;s built on these abstractions</p>
<p>that were they the only ones possible?</p>
<p>Certainly not, but they led to,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s very hard to do it differently.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s an inertia that&rsquo;s very hard to,</p>
<p>you know, push out, push away from.</p>
<p>That has implications for things like,</p>
<p>you know, the Julia language,</p>
<p>which you have heard of, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve met the creators and I liked Julia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really cool language,</p>
<p>but they struggled to kind of against the,</p>
<p>just the tide of like this inertia of people using Python.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s strategies to approach that,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, it&rsquo;s a phenomena.</p>
<p>And sometimes, so I love complex numbers</p>
<p>and I love to raise, so I looked at Python.</p>
<p>And then I had the experience, I did some stuff in Python</p>
<p>and I was just doing my PhD.</p>
<p>So I was out, my focus was on,</p>
<p>I was actually doing a combination of MRI and ultrasound</p>
<p>and looking at a phenomenon called elastography,</p>
<p>which is you push waves into the body</p>
<p>and observe those waves, like you can actually measure them.</p>
<p>And then you do mathematical inversion</p>
<p>to see what the elasticity is.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the problem I was solving</p>
<p>is how to do that with both ultrasound and MRI.</p>
<p>I needed some tool to do that with.</p>
<p>So I was starting to use Python in 97.</p>
<p>In 98, I went back, looked at what I&rsquo;d written</p>
<p>and realized I could still understand it,</p>
<p>which is not the experience I&rsquo;d had</p>
<p>when doing Perl in 95, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d done the same thing and then I looked back</p>
<p>and I forgotten what I was even saying.</p>
<p>Now, you know, I&rsquo;m not saying, so that may,</p>
<p>hey, this may work, I like this.</p>
<p>This is something I can retain</p>
<p>without becoming an expert per se.</p>
<p>And so that led me to go, I&rsquo;m gonna push more into this.</p>
<p>And then that 98 was kind of when I started</p>
<p>to fall in love with Python, I would say.</p>
<p>A few peculiar things about Python.</p>
<p>So maybe compare it to Perl,</p>
<p>compare it to some of the other languages.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no braces.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So space is used, indentation, I should say,</p>
<p>is used as part of the language.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So did you, I mean, that&rsquo;s quite a leap.</p>
<p>Were you comfortable with that leap</p>
<p>or were you just very open minded?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I was open minded, so I was cognizant of the concern.</p>
<p>And it definitely has, it has specific challenges.</p>
<p>You know, cut and pasting.</p>
<p>For example, when you&rsquo;re cut and pasting code,</p>
<p>and if your editors aren&rsquo;t supportive of that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re putting it into a terminal,</p>
<p>and particularly in the past when terminals</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t necessarily have the intelligence to manage it now.</p>
<p>Now, I, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks</p>
<p>handle that just fine, so there&rsquo;s really no problem.</p>
<p>But in the past, it created some challenges,</p>
<p>formatting challenges, also mixed tabs and spaces.</p>
<p>If editors weren&rsquo;t, you weren&rsquo;t clear</p>
<p>on what was happening, you would have these issues.</p>
<p>So there were really concrete reasons about it</p>
<p>that I heard and understood.</p>
<p>I never really encountered a problem with it personally.</p>
<p>Like, it was occasional annoyances,</p>
<p>but I really liked the fact</p>
<p>that it didn&rsquo;t have all this extra characters, right?</p>
<p>That these extra characters didn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>in my visual field when I was just trying</p>
<p>to process understanding a snippet of code.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a cleanness to it.</p>
<p>But, I mean, the idea is supposed to be</p>
<p>that Perl also has a cleanness to it</p>
<p>because of the minimalism of how many characters</p>
<p>it takes to express a certain thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very compact.</p>
<p>But what you realize with that compactness comes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a culture that prizes compactness,</p>
<p>and so the code gets more and more compact</p>
<p>and less and less readable to a point where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>like, to be a good programmer in Perl,</p>
<p>you write code that&rsquo;s basically unreadable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a culture, like.</p>
<p>Correct, and you&rsquo;re proud of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re proud of it.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, and it&rsquo;s like, feels good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really selective.</p>
<p>It means you have to be an expert in Perl to understand it.</p>
<p>Whereas Python allowed you not to have to be an expert.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to take all this brain energy.</p>
<p>You could leverage, what I say,</p>
<p>you could leverage your English language center,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re using all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wondered about other languages,</p>
<p>particularly non Latin based languages.</p>
<p>Latin based languages with the characters are at least similar.</p>
<p>I think people have an easier time,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be a Japanese</p>
<p>or a Chinese person trying to learn different syntax.</p>
<p>Like, what would computer programming look like in that?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked at that at all,</p>
<p>but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, leveraging your Chinese language center,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure Python or any programming does that.</p>
<p>But that was a big deal.</p>
<p>The fact that it was accessible, I could be a scientist.</p>
<p>What I really liked is many programming languages</p>
<p>really demand a lot of you, and you can get a lot,</p>
<p>you know, you do a lot if you learn it.</p>
<p>But Python enables you to do a lot</p>
<p>without demanding a lot of you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nuance to that statement,</p>
<p>but it certainly was, it&rsquo;s more accessible.</p>
<p>So more people could actually, as a scientist,</p>
<p>as somebody who, or an engineer,</p>
<p>who was trying to solve another problem</p>
<p>besides point programming,</p>
<p>I could still use this language and get things done</p>
<p>and be happy about it.</p>
<p>And I was also comfortable in C at that time.</p>
<p>And MATLAB, you did a little bit of that.</p>
<p>And MATLAB, I did a lot before that, exactly.</p>
<p>So I was comfortable in,</p>
<p>those three languages were really the tools I used</p>
<p>during my studies and schooling.</p>
<p>But to your point about language helping you think,</p>
<p>one of the big things about MATLAB was it was,</p>
<p>and APL before it, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember APL.</p>
<p>APL is actually the predecessor of array based programming,</p>
<p>which I think is really an underappreciated,</p>
<p>if I talk to people who are just steeped</p>
<p>in computer programming, computer science,</p>
<p>like most of the people that Microsoft has hired</p>
<p>in the past, for example,</p>
<p>Microsoft as a company generally did not understand</p>
<p>array based programming.</p>
<p>Like culturally, they didn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>So they kept missing the boat,</p>
<p>kept missing the understanding of what this was.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gotten better,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a whole culture of folks</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t, programming, that&rsquo;s systems programming</p>
<p>or web programming or lists and maps.</p>
<p>And what about an n dimensional array?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s just an implementation detail.</p>
<p>Well, you can think that,</p>
<p>but then actually if you have that as a construct,</p>
<p>you actually think differently.</p>
<p>APL was the first language to understand that.</p>
<p>And it was in the sixties, right?</p>
<p>The challenge of APL is APL had very dense,</p>
<p>not only glyphs, like new characters, new glyphs,</p>
<p>but they even had a new keyboard</p>
<p>because to produce those glyphs,</p>
<p>this is back in the early days in computing</p>
<p>when the QWERTY keyboard maybe wasn&rsquo;t as established,</p>
<p>like, well, we can have a new keyboard, no big deal.</p>
<p>But it was a big deal and it didn&rsquo;t catch on.</p>
<p>And the language APL, very much like Perl,</p>
<p>as people would pride themselves on how much,</p>
<p>could they write the game of life</p>
<p>in 30 characters of APL.</p>
<p>APL has characters that mean summation</p>
<p>and they have adverbs,</p>
<p>they would have adjectives and these things called adverbs,</p>
<p>which are like methods, like reduction,</p>
<p>reduction would be an adverb on an ad operator, right?</p>
<p>So, but doing, using these tools you could construct</p>
<p>and then you start to think at that level,</p>
<p>you think in n dimensions is something I like to say,</p>
<p>and you start to think differently about data at that point.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re, it really helps.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, outside of programming,</p>
<p>if you really internalize linear algebra as a course,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s philosophically allows you</p>
<p>to think of the world differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like liberating, you don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to think about the individual numbers</p>
<p>in the n dimensional array.</p>
<p>You could think of it as an object in itself</p>
<p>and all of a sudden this world can open up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying MATLAB and APL were like the early C,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if many languages got that right ever.</p>
<p>No, no, no they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Even still.</p>
<p>Even still, I would say.</p>
<p>I mean, NumPy is an inheritor of the traditions</p>
<p>that I would say APLJ was another version that was,</p>
<p>what it did is not have the glyphs,</p>
<p>just have short characters,</p>
<p>but still a Latin keyboard could type them.</p>
<p>And then numeric inherited from that</p>
<p>in terms of let&rsquo;s add arrays plus broadcasting</p>
<p>plus methods, reduction,</p>
<p>even some of the language like rank is a concept</p>
<p>that was in Python and is still in Python</p>
<p>for the number of dimensions, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different than say the rank of a matrix</p>
<p>which people think of as well.</p>
<p>So it came from that tradition,</p>
<p>but NumPy is a very pragmatic, practical tool.</p>
<p>NumPy inherited from numeric</p>
<p>and we can get to where NumPy came from</p>
<p>which is the current array,</p>
<p>at least current as of 2015, 2017.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a ton of them over the past two or three years.</p>
<p>We can get into that too.</p>
<p>So if we just linger on the early days</p>
<p>of what was your favorite feature of Python?</p>
<p>Do you remember like what?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so interesting to linger on like the,</p>
<p>what really makes you connect with a language?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s obvious to introspect that.</p>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve thought about that at some length.</p>
<p>I think definitely the fact that I could read it later,</p>
<p>that I could use it productively</p>
<p>without becoming an expert.</p>
<p>Other language I had to put more effort into.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like an empirical observation.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not analyzing any one aspect of the language.</p>
<p>It just seems time after time when you look back,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow readable.</p>
<p>Then it was sort of, I could take executable English</p>
<p>and translate it to Python more easily.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t have to go, there was no translation layer.</p>
<p>As an engineer or as a scientist,</p>
<p>I could think about what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And then the syntax wasn&rsquo;t that far behind it, right?</p>
<p>Now there are some warts there still.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some areas where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>ah, it&rsquo;d be better if this were different</p>
<p>or if this were different.</p>
<p>Some of those things got added to the language too.</p>
<p>I was really grateful for some of the early pioneers</p>
<p>in the Python ecosystem back,</p>
<p>because Python got written in 91.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the first version came out.</p>
<p>But Guido was very open to users.</p>
<p>And one of the sets of users were people like Jim Huganen</p>
<p>and David Asher and Paul Dubois and Conrad Hinson.</p>
<p>These were people that were on the main list.</p>
<p>And they were just asking for things like,</p>
<p>hey, we really should have complex numbers in this language.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a J, there&rsquo;s a one J, right?</p>
<p>And the fact that they went the engineering route of J</p>
<p>is interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s entirely favoring engineers.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because I is so often used</p>
<p>as the index of a for loop.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s actually why.</p>
<p>Probably, I mean, there&rsquo;s a pragmatic aspect.</p>
<p>But the fact that complex numbers were there, I love that.</p>
<p>The fact that I could write in the array constructs</p>
<p>and that reduction was there,</p>
<p>very simple to write summations and broadcasting was there.</p>
<p>I could do addition of whole arrays.</p>
<p>So that was cool.</p>
<p>Those are some things I loved about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to start talking to you about</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve created so many incredible projects</p>
<p>that basically changed the whole landscape of programming.</p>
<p>But okay, let&rsquo;s start with,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go chronologically with SciPy.</p>
<p>You created SciPy over two decades ago now?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I love to talk about SciPy.</p>
<p>SciPy was really my baby.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What was its goal?</p>
<p>What is its goal?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>Yeah, fantastic.</p>
<p>So SciPy was effectively, here I am using Python</p>
<p>to do stuff that I previously used MATLAB to use.</p>
<p>And I was using numeric, which is an array library</p>
<p>that made a lot of it possible.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s things that were missing.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t have an ordinary differential equation solver</p>
<p>I could just call, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have integration.</p>
<p>Hey, I wanted to integrate this function.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I don&rsquo;t have just a function</p>
<p>I can call to do that.</p>
<p>These are things I remember being critical things</p>
<p>that I was missing.</p>
<p>Optimization.</p>
<p>I just wanna pass a function to an optimizer</p>
<p>and have it tell me what the optimal value is.</p>
<p>Those are things I&rsquo;m like, well,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we just write a library that adds these tools?</p>
<p>And I started to post on the mailing list</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;d previously been, people have discussed,</p>
<p>I remember Conrad Henson saying,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we had this optimizer library</p>
<p>or David Ashwood say this stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a ambitious, ambitious is the wrong word,</p>
<p>an eager and probably more time than sense.</p>
<p>I was a poor graduate student.</p>
<p>My wife thinks I&rsquo;m working on my PhD and I am,</p>
<p>but part of the PhD that I loved</p>
<p>was the fact that it&rsquo;s exploratory.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just taking orders,</p>
<p>fulfilling a list of things to do,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>And so I thought, well, I&rsquo;m running tools</p>
<p>for my own use and a PhD,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll just start this project.</p>
<p>And so in 99, 98 was when I first started</p>
<p>to write libraries for Python.</p>
<p>Definitely when I fell in love with Python 98,</p>
<p>I thought, oh, well, there&rsquo;s just a few things missing.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I need a reader to read DICOM files.</p>
<p>I was in medical imaging and DICOM was a format</p>
<p>that I want to be able to load that into Python.</p>
<p>Okay, how do I write a reader for that?</p>
<p>So I wrote something called, it was an IO package, right?</p>
<p>And that was my very first extension module, which is C.</p>
<p>So I wrote C code to extend Python</p>
<p>so that in Python I could write things more easily.</p>
<p>That combination kind of hooked me.</p>
<p>It was the idea that I could,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this powerful tool I can use as a scripting language</p>
<p>and a high level language to think about,</p>
<p>but that I can extend easily, easily in C,</p>
<p>easily for me because I knew enough C.</p>
<p>And then Guido had written a link.</p>
<p>I mean, the only, the hard part of extending Python</p>
<p>was something called the way memory management networks,</p>
<p>and you have to do reference counting.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a tracking of reference counting</p>
<p>you have to do manually.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, you have memory leaks.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Plus then C, you know, it&rsquo;s just much more,</p>
<p>you have to put more effort into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, I have to now think about pointers</p>
<p>and I have to think about stuff that is different.</p>
<p>I have to kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like putting a new cartridge in your brain.</p>
<p>Like, okay, I&rsquo;m thinking about MRI.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m thinking about programming.</p>
<p>And there are distinct modules</p>
<p>you end up having to think about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>And when I was just in Python,</p>
<p>I could just think about MRI and high level writing,</p>
<p>but I could do that.</p>
<p>And that kind of, I liked it.</p>
<p>I found that to be enjoyable and fun.</p>
<p>And so I ended up, oh,</p>
<p>well, let me just add a bunch of stuff to Python</p>
<p>to do integration.</p>
<p>Well, and the cool thing is,</p>
<p>is that the power of the internet,</p>
<p>just looking around and I found,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s this NetLive,</p>
<p>which has hundreds of 4chan routines</p>
<p>that people have written in the 60s and the 70s and the 80s</p>
<p>in 4chan 77, fortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t 4chan 16.</p>
<p>So it had been ported to 4chan 77.</p>
<p>And 4chan 77 is actually a really great language.</p>
<p>4chan 90 probably is my favorite 4chan</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s got complex numbers,</p>
<p>got arrays and it&rsquo;s pretty high level.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with it</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;d never want to write a program in 4chan 90</p>
<p>or 4chan 77,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s totally fine to write a subroutine in, right?</p>
<p>And so, and then 4chan kind of got a little off course</p>
<p>when they tried to compete with C++.</p>
<p>But at the time,</p>
<p>I just want libraries to do something like,</p>
<p>oh, here&rsquo;s an ordinary differential equation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s integration.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s runge cut integration.</p>
<p>Already done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to think about that algorithm.</p>
<p>I mean, you could,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nice to have somebody who&rsquo;s already done one</p>
<p>and tested it.</p>
<p>And so I sort of started this journey in 98, really.</p>
<p>If you look back at the mailing list,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of this productive era of me</p>
<p>writing an extension module</p>
<p>to connect runge cut integration to Python</p>
<p>and making an ordinary differential equation solver.</p>
<p>And then releasing that as a package.</p>
<p>So we could call ODE pack, I think I called it then.</p>
<p>Quad pack.</p>
<p>And then I just made these packages.</p>
<p>Eventually that became multipack</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re originally modular.</p>
<p>You can install them separately.</p>
<p>But a massive problem in Python</p>
<p>was actually just getting your stuff installed.</p>
<p>At the time, releasing software for me,</p>
<p>like today it&rsquo;s people think, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, then it meant some poorly written webpage.</p>
<p>I had some bad webpage up and I put a tarball,</p>
<p>just a GZIP tarball of source code.</p>
<p>That was the release.</p>
<p>But okay, can we just stand that?</p>
<p>Because the community aspect</p>
<p>of creating the package and sharing that, that&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>That, to have, to both have the, at that time,</p>
<p>so like the raw.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was pretty early, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, well, not rare.</p>
<p>Maybe you can correct me on this,</p>
<p>but it seems like in the scientific community,</p>
<p>so many people, you were basically solving the problems</p>
<p>you needed to solve to process the particular application,</p>
<p>the data that you need.</p>
<p>And to also have the mind</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to make this usable for others, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I would say I was inspired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been inspired by Linux,</p>
<p>been inspired by Linus and him making his code available.</p>
<p>And I was starting to use Linux at the time.</p>
<p>And I went, this is cool.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d kind of been previously primed that way.</p>
<p>And generally I was into science</p>
<p>because I liked the sharing notion.</p>
<p>I liked the idea of, hey, let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if collectively we build knowledge and share it,</p>
<p>we can all be better off.</p>
<p>Okay, so you want to energize by that idea.</p>
<p>So I was energized by that idea already, right?</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t deny that I was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of had this very,</p>
<p>I liked that part of science, that part of sharing.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, oh, wait, here&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s something I could do.</p>
<p>And then I slowly over years learned how to share better</p>
<p>so that you could actually engage more people faster.</p>
<p>One of the key things was actually giving people a binary</p>
<p>they could install, right?</p>
<p>So that it wasn&rsquo;t just your source code, good luck.</p>
<p>Compile this and then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s compiled, ready to install, just, you know.</p>
<p>So in fact, a lot of the journey from 98,</p>
<p>even through 2012 when I started Anaconda was about that.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s why, you know, it&rsquo;s really the key</p>
<p>as to why a scientist with dreams of doing MRI research</p>
<p>ended up starting a software company</p>
<p>that installs software.</p>
<p>I work with a few folks now that don&rsquo;t program</p>
<p>like on the creative side and the video side,</p>
<p>the audio side.</p>
<p>And because my whole life is running on scripts,</p>
<p>I have to try to get them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having all the task of teaching them</p>
<p>how to do Python enough to run the scripts.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been actually facing this,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Anaconda or some with the task of</p>
<p>how do I minimally explain basically to my mom</p>
<p>how to write a Python script.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting challenge.</p>
<p>I have to, it&rsquo;s a to do item for me to figure out like,</p>
<p>what is the minimal amount of information I have to teach?</p>
<p>What are the tools you use that one, you enjoy it,</p>
<p>two, you&rsquo;re effective at it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re related, those are two related questions.</p>
<p>And then the debugging, like the iterative process</p>
<p>of running the script to figure out what the error is,</p>
<p>maybe even for some people to do the fix yourself.</p>
<p>So do you compile it?</p>
<p>Do you, like how do you distribute that code to them?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If you increase the circle of empathy,</p>
<p>the circle of people that are able to use your programs,</p>
<p>you increase it, it&rsquo;s like effectiveness and it&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>And so you have to think, can I write scripts?</p>
<p>Can I write programs that can be used by medical engineers,</p>
<p>by all kinds of people that don&rsquo;t know programming</p>
<p>and actually maybe plant a seed,</p>
<p>have them catch the bug of programming</p>
<p>so that they start on a journey.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>And ultimately it has to do with the Amazon one click buy.</p>
<p>Like how frictionless can you make the early steps?</p>
<p>Frictionless is actually really key.</p>
<p>To go in any community is, any friction point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna lose some people, right?</p>
<p>Now sometimes you may wanna intentionally do that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re early enough on, you need a lot of help.</p>
<p>You need people who have the skills.</p>
<p>You might actually, it&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily have too many users</p>
<p>as opposed to contributors if you&rsquo;re early on.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s, SciFi started in 98,</p>
<p>but it really emerged as this collection of modules</p>
<p>that I was just putting on the net.</p>
<p>People were downloading and I think I got 100 users, right?</p>
<p>By the end of that year.</p>
<p>But the fact that I got 100 users and more than that,</p>
<p>people started to email me with fixes.</p>
<p>And that was actually intoxicating, right?</p>
<p>That was the, here I&rsquo;m writing papers</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m giving conferences and I get people to say hello,</p>
<p>but yeah, good job.</p>
<p>But mostly it was, you&rsquo;re viewed with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s competitive, right?</p>
<p>You publish a paper and people are like,</p>
<p>oh, it wasn&rsquo;t my paper.</p>
<p>I was starting to see that sense of academic life</p>
<p>where it was so much,</p>
<p>I thought there was this cooperative effort,</p>
<p>but it sounds like we&rsquo;re here just to one up each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not true across the board,</p>
<p>but a lot of that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>But here in this world,</p>
<p>I was getting responses from people all over the world.</p>
<p>I remember Pjaro Peterson in Estonia, right?</p>
<p>Was one of the first people.</p>
<p>And he sent me back this make file,</p>
<p>cause the first thing it is, yeah, your build thing stinks</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s a better make file.</p>
<p>Now it was a complex make file.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I never understood that make file actually,</p>
<p>but it worked and it did a lot more.</p>
<p>And so I said, thanks, this is cool.</p>
<p>And that was my first kind of engagement</p>
<p>with community development.</p>
<p>But the process was, he sent me a patch file.</p>
<p>I had to upload a new tar ball.</p>
<p>And I just found, I really love that.</p>
<p>And the style back then was here&rsquo;s a mailing list.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it wasn&rsquo;t as,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly weren&rsquo;t the tools that are available today.</p>
<p>It was very early on, but I really started to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the whole year.</p>
<p>I think I did about seven packages that year, right?</p>
<p>And then by the end of the year,</p>
<p>I collected them into a thing called multipack.</p>
<p>So in 99, there was this thing called multipack.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when a high school student,</p>
<p>no, he was a high school student at the time,</p>
<p>guy named Robert Kern,</p>
<p>took that package and made a Windows installer, right?</p>
<p>And then of course, a massive increase of usage.</p>
<p>So by the way, most of this development was under Linux.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it was on Linux.</p>
<p>I was a Linux developer doing it on a Unix box.</p>
<p>I mean, at the time I was actually getting into,</p>
<p>I had a new hard drive,</p>
<p>did some kernel programming to make the hard drive work.</p>
<p>I mean, not programming, but modification to the kernel</p>
<p>so I could actually get a hard drive working.</p>
<p>I love that aspect of it.</p>
<p>I was also in, at school, I was building a cluster.</p>
<p>I took Mac computers and you put yellow dog Linux on them.</p>
<p>At the Mayo Clinic, they were just,</p>
<p>they had all these Macs that were older,</p>
<p>they were just getting rid of.</p>
<p>And so I kind of got permission to go grab them together.</p>
<p>I put about 24 of them together in a cluster, in a cabinet,</p>
<p>and put yellow dog Linux on them all.</p>
<p>And I wrote a C++ program to do MRI simulation.</p>
<p>That was what I was doing at the same time</p>
<p>for my day job, so to speak.</p>
<p>So I was loving the whole process.</p>
<p>And the same time I was,</p>
<p>oh, I need a ordinary differential equation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why ordinary differential equations were key</p>
<p>was because that&rsquo;s the heart of a block equation</p>
<p>for simulating MRI, is an ODE solver.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, but I actually did that,</p>
<p>it just happened at the same time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it was kind of what you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re interested in, they&rsquo;re coinciding.</p>
<p>I was definitely scratching my own itch</p>
<p>in terms of building stuff.</p>
<p>And which helped in the sense that I was using it for me,</p>
<p>so at least I had one user.</p>
<p>I had one person who was like, well, no, this is better.</p>
<p>I like this interface better.</p>
<p>And I had the experience of MATLAB</p>
<p>to guide some of what those APIs might look like.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re just doing yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building all this stuff.</p>
<p>But with the Windows installer,</p>
<p>it was the first time I realized, oh yeah,</p>
<p>the binary installer really helps people.</p>
<p>And so that led to spending more time</p>
<p>on that side of things.</p>
<p>So around 2000, so I graduated my PhD in 2000,</p>
<p>end of year, end of 2000.</p>
<p>So 99 doing a lot of work there,</p>
<p>98 doing a lot of work there,</p>
<p>99 kind of spending more time on my PhD,</p>
<p>helping people use the tools,</p>
<p>thinking about what do I want to go from here.</p>
<p>There was a company, there was a guy actually,</p>
<p>Eric Jones and Travis Vought.</p>
<p>They were two friends who founded a company called NTHOT.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s here in Austin, still here.</p>
<p>And they, Eric contacted me at the time</p>
<p>when I was a graduate student still.</p>
<p>And he said, hey, why don&rsquo;t you come down?</p>
<p>We want to build a company.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking of a scientific company</p>
<p>and we want to take what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and kind of add it to some stuff that he&rsquo;d done.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d written some tools.</p>
<p>And then Piero Peterson had done F2Py.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s come together and build,</p>
<p>pull this all together and call it SciPy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the origin of the SciPy brand.</p>
<p>It came from multi pack</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of modules I&rsquo;d written,</p>
<p>plus a few things from some other folks</p>
<p>and then pulled together in a single installer.</p>
<p>SciPy was really a distribution of Python</p>
<p>masquerading as a library.</p>
<p>How did you think about SciPy in context of Python,</p>
<p>in context of Numeric, like what?</p>
<p>So we saw SciPy as a way to make an R&amp;D environment</p>
<p>for Python, like use Python, depended on Numeric.</p>
<p>So Numeric was the array library we depended on.</p>
<p>And then from there, extend it with a bunch of modules</p>
<p>that allowed for, and at the time,</p>
<p>the original vision of SciPy was to have plotting,</p>
<p>was to have the REPL environment</p>
<p>and kind of really a whole data environment</p>
<p>that you could then install and get going with.</p>
<p>And that was kind of the thinking.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really evolve that way, right?</p>
<p>It sort of had a, for one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to do massive scale projects</p>
<p>with open source collectives.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s sort of an intrinsic cooperation limit</p>
<p>as to which, too many cooks in the kitchen,</p>
<p>you can do amazing infrastructure work.</p>
<p>When it comes down to bringing it all together</p>
<p>into a single deliverable,</p>
<p>that actually requires a little more product management</p>
<p>that is not, that doesn&rsquo;t really emerge</p>
<p>from the same dynamic.</p>
<p>So it struggled, struggled to get almost too many voices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to have everybody agree.</p>
<p>Consensus doesn&rsquo;t really work at that scale.</p>
<p>You end up with politics,</p>
<p>with the same kind of things that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in large organizations trying to decide</p>
<p>what to do together.</p>
<p>So consensus building was challenging at scale</p>
<p>as more people came in, right?</p>
<p>Early on, it&rsquo;s fine, because there&rsquo;s nobody there.</p>
<p>So it works, but then as you get more successful</p>
<p>and more people use it, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s this scale at which this doesn&rsquo;t work anymore</p>
<p>and we have to come up with different approaches.</p>
<p>So Sidepy came out officially in 2001,</p>
<p>was the first release, most of the time.</p>
<p>I remember the days of getting that release ready.</p>
<p>It was a Windows installer and there were bugs</p>
<p>on how the Windows compiler handled complex numbers</p>
<p>and you were chasing segmentation faults.</p>
<p>And it was, it&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>There was a lot of effort had nothing to do</p>
<p>with my area of study.</p>
<p>And at the same time, I had just gotten an offer.</p>
<p>So he wondered if I wanted to come down</p>
<p>and help him start that company with his friend.</p>
<p>And at the time I was like, I was intrigued,</p>
<p>but I was squaring a path, an academic path.</p>
<p>And I had just got an offer to go and teach at my alma mater.</p>
<p>So I took that tenure track position.</p>
<p>And Sidepy, and kind of, then I started to work on Sidepy</p>
<p>as a professor too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I left, I&rsquo;ve got the Mayo Clinic,</p>
<p>graduated, wrote my thesis using Sidepy,</p>
<p>wrote, you know, there&rsquo;s images that were created.</p>
<p>Now the plotting tool I used was something</p>
<p>from Yorick actually.</p>
<p>It was a plotting, a PLT kind of a plotting language</p>
<p>that I used.</p>
<p>Yorick is a programming language?</p>
<p>It was a programming language, had a plotting tool,</p>
<p>Dyslin, it had integration to Dyslin.</p>
<p>I ended up using Dyslin plus some of the plotting</p>
<p>from Yorick linked to from Python.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was, people don&rsquo;t plot that way now,</p>
<p>but this is before, and Sidepy was trying to add plotting.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have much success.</p>
<p>Really the success of plotting came from John Hunter,</p>
<p>who had a similar experience to my experience,</p>
<p>my kind of maverick experience as a person</p>
<p>just trying to get stuff done and kind of having more time</p>
<p>than money maybe, right?</p>
<p>And John Hunter created what?</p>
<p>MapPlotLib.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the creator of MapPlotLib.</p>
<p>Yeah, so John Hunter was, you know,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t a student at the time, but he was an,</p>
<p>he was working in Quant field and he said,</p>
<p>we need better plotting.</p>
<p>So he just went out and said, cool, I&rsquo;ll make a new project</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll call it MapPlotLib.</p>
<p>And he released in 2001,</p>
<p>about the same time that Sidepy came out</p>
<p>and it was separate library, separate install,</p>
<p>use numeric, Sidepy use numeric.</p>
<p>And so Sidepy, you know, in 2001, we released Sidepy</p>
<p>and then Endthought created a conference called Sidepy,</p>
<p>which was brought people together to talk about the space.</p>
<p>And that conference is still ongoing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the favorite conferences of a lot of people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s changed over the years,</p>
<p>but early on it was, you know, a collection of 50 people</p>
<p>who care about, scientists mostly, you know,</p>
<p>practicing scientists who want, who care about coding</p>
<p>and doing it well and not using MATLAB.</p>
<p>And I remember being driven by, you know, I liked MATLAB,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not opposed to proprietary software.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not an open source zealot.</p>
<p>I love open source for the, what it brings,</p>
<p>but I also see the role for proprietary software.</p>
<p>But what I didn&rsquo;t like was the fact that I would develop</p>
<p>code and publish it and then effectively telling somebody</p>
<p>here to run my code, you have to have</p>
<p>this proprietary software.</p>
<p>Right, and there&rsquo;s also culture around MATLAB as much,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve talked to a few folks in,</p>
<p>MathWorks creates MATLAB?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just a culture, they try really hard,</p>
<p>but it just, there&rsquo;s this corporate IBM style culture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say negative things about IBM or whatever,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s really that connection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m in the middle of right now</p>
<p>is the business of open source.</p>
<p>And how do you connect the ethos of cooperative development</p>
<p>with the necessity of creating profits, right?</p>
<p>And like right now today, I&rsquo;m still in the middle of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the early days of me exploring this question.</p>
<p>Cause I was writing SciPy, I mean, as an aside,</p>
<p>I also had, so I had three kids at the time.</p>
<p>I have six kids now.</p>
<p>I got married early, wanted a family.</p>
<p>I had three kids and I remember reading,</p>
<p>I read Richard Stallman&rsquo;s post and I was a fan of Stallman.</p>
<p>I would read his work, I liked this collective ideas</p>
<p>he would have.</p>
<p>Certainly the ideas on IP law, I read a lot of his stuff.</p>
<p>But then he said, okay, well,</p>
<p>how do I make money with this?</p>
<p>How do I make a living?</p>
<p>How do I pay for my kids?</p>
<p>All this stuff was in my mind,</p>
<p>young graduate student making no money,</p>
<p>thinking I got to get a job.</p>
<p>And he said, well, I think just be like me</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have kids, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his take on it.</p>
<p>That was what he said in that moment, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing I read and I went,</p>
<p>okay, this is a train I can&rsquo;t get on.</p>
<p>There has to be a way to preserve the culture</p>
<p>of open source and still be able to make sufficient money</p>
<p>to feed your kids.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, there&rsquo;s gotta be.</p>
<p>Well, so that actually led me to a study of economics.</p>
<p>Because at the time I was ignorant and I really was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually, I&rsquo;m embarrassed for educational system</p>
<p>that they could let me and I was valedictorian</p>
<p>in my high school class and I did super well in college.</p>
<p>And like academically I did great, right?</p>
<p>But the fact that I could do that and then be clueless</p>
<p>about this key part of life,</p>
<p>it led me to go, there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Like I should have learned this in fifth grade.</p>
<p>I should have learned this in eighth grade.</p>
<p>Like everybody should come out</p>
<p>with a basic knowledge of economics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an interesting example because you&rsquo;ve created tools</p>
<p>that change the lives of probably millions of people</p>
<p>and the fact that you don&rsquo;t understand at the time</p>
<p>of the creation of those tools, the basics economics</p>
<p>of how like to build up a giant system is the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And so during my PhD at the same time,</p>
<p>this is back in 98, 99 at the same time,</p>
<p>I was in a library, I was reading books on capitalism,</p>
<p>I was reading books on Marxism,</p>
<p>I was reading books on what is this thing?</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>And I encountered, basically I encountered a set of writings</p>
<p>from people that said they were the inheritors of Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Read Adam Smith for the first time, right?</p>
<p>Which is the wealth of nations</p>
<p>and kind of this notion of emergent societies</p>
<p>and realized, oh, there&rsquo;s this whole world out here</p>
<p>of people and the challenge of economics is also political.</p>
<p>Like, cause economics, people, different parties</p>
<p>running for office, they want their economic friends.</p>
<p>They want their economists to back them up, right?</p>
<p>Or to be their magicians, like the magicians</p>
<p>in Pharaoh&rsquo;s court, right?</p>
<p>The people that are kind of say, hey, this is,</p>
<p>you should listen to me because I&rsquo;ve got the expert</p>
<p>who says this.</p>
<p>And so it gets really muddled, right?</p>
<p>But I was looking at it from as a scientist going,</p>
<p>what is this space?</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>How does Paris get fed?</p>
<p>How does, what is money?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>And I found a lot of writings that I really loved.</p>
<p>I found some things that I really loved</p>
<p>and I learned from that.</p>
<p>It was writings from people like Von Missess.</p>
<p>He wrote a paper in 1920 that still should be read</p>
<p>more than it is.</p>
<p>It was the economic calculation problem</p>
<p>of the socialist commonwealth.</p>
<p>It was basically in response</p>
<p>to the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.</p>
<p>And his basic argument was it&rsquo;s not gonna work</p>
<p>to not have private property.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be able to come up with prices.</p>
<p>The bureaucrats aren&rsquo;t gonna be able to determine</p>
<p>how to allocate resources without a price system.</p>
<p>And a price system emerges from people making trades.</p>
<p>And they can only make trades if they have authority</p>
<p>over the thing they&rsquo;re trading.</p>
<p>And that creates information flow</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t have if you try to top down it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, huh, that&rsquo;s a really good point.</p>
<p>Yeah, the prices have a signal that&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to have that signal</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to build a community</p>
<p>of productive people like you would</p>
<p>in the software engineering space.</p>
<p>Yeah, the prices are actually</p>
<p>an important signaling mechanism.</p>
<p>Right, and that money is just a bartering tool.</p>
<p>Right, so this is the first time I&rsquo;ve encountered</p>
<p>any of this concept, right, and the fact that,</p>
<p>oh, this is actually really critical.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so critical to our prosperity</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re dangerously not learning about this,</p>
<p>not teaching our children about this.</p>
<p>So you had the three kids,</p>
<p>you had to make some hard decisions.</p>
<p>I had to make some money, right, had to figure it out.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never been driven by money, just need it.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, need to eat.</p>
<p>So how did that resolve itself in terms of site buy?</p>
<p>So I would say it didn&rsquo;t really resolve itself.</p>
<p>It sort of started a journey that I&rsquo;m continuing on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on, I would say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it resolved itself.</p>
<p>But I will say I went in eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Like I knew that there were problems</p>
<p>with giving stuff away and creating the market externalities</p>
<p>that the fact that, yeah, people might use it</p>
<p>and I might not get paid for it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have to figure something else out to get paid.</p>
<p>Like at least I can say I&rsquo;m not bitter</p>
<p>that a lot of people have used stuff that I&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t necessarily benefited economically from it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard other people be bitter about that</p>
<p>when they write or they talk.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I should&rsquo;ve got more value out of this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also, I want to create systems</p>
<p>that let people like me who might have these desires</p>
<p>to do things, let them benefit.</p>
<p>So it actually creates more of the same.</p>
<p>Not to turn on your bitterness module,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some aspect, I wish there was mechanisms for me</p>
<p>to reward whoever created side buy and non buy</p>
<p>because it brought so much joy to my life.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>The tip dark notion was there.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>But there should be a very frictionless mechanism.</p>
<p>There should be a frictionless mechanism.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I would love to talk about some of the ideas I have</p>
<p>because I actually came across,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve come up with some interesting notions</p>
<p>that could work, but they&rsquo;ll require anything that will work</p>
<p>takes time to emerge, right?</p>
<p>Like things don&rsquo;t just turn overnight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely one thing I&rsquo;ve also understood</p>
<p>and learned is any fixes, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>We often give credit to, oh, this president gets elected</p>
<p>and oh, look how great things have done.</p>
<p>And I saw that when I had a transition in a condo</p>
<p>when a new CEO came in, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the success that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an inertia there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and sometimes the decision you made</p>
<p>like 10 years before is the reason why the success is the.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sort of just running around taking credit</p>
<p>for stuff.</p>
<p>The credit assignment has like a delay to it</p>
<p>that makes the credit assignment basically wrong</p>
<p>more than right.</p>
<p>Wrong more than right, exactly.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like, oh, this is, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the stuff I would read a ton about, you know,</p>
<p>early on.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I feel like I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>Like I want the same thing.</p>
<p>I want to be able to, and honestly, not for personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been happy.</p>
<p>I feel like I don&rsquo;t have any, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been done reasonably okay, but I&rsquo;ve had to pursue it.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s really what started my trajectory from academia</p>
<p>is reading that stuff led me to say,</p>
<p>oh, entrepreneurship matters.</p>
<p>So I love software, but we need more entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and I wanna understand that better.</p>
<p>So once I kind of had that virus infect my brain,</p>
<p>even though I was on a trajectory</p>
<p>to go to a tenure track position at a university</p>
<p>and I was there for six years,</p>
<p>I was kind of already out the door when I started.</p>
<p>And we can get into that, but.</p>
<p>Well, can I just ask you a quick question on,</p>
<p>is there some design principles</p>
<p>that were in your mind around SciPy?</p>
<p>Like, is there some key ideas</p>
<p>that were just like sticking to you</p>
<p>that this is the fundamental ideas?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p>I would think it&rsquo;s basically accessibility to scientists,</p>
<p>like give them, give scientists and engineers tools</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have to think a lot about programming.</p>
<p>So give them really good building blocks,</p>
<p>give them functions that they wanna call</p>
<p>and sort of just the right length of spelling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one tradition in programming where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>make very, very long names, right?</p>
<p>And you can see it in some programming languages</p>
<p>where the names get, take half the screen.</p>
<p>And in the 4chan world, characters had to be six letters</p>
<p>early on, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s way too much, too little.</p>
<p>But I was like, I liked to have names</p>
<p>that were informative but short.</p>
<p>So even though Python, well this is a different conversation,</p>
<p>but documentation is doing some work there.</p>
<p>So when you look at great scientific libraries</p>
<p>and functions, there&rsquo;s a richness of documentation</p>
<p>that helps you get into the details.</p>
<p>The first glance at a function gives you the intuition</p>
<p>of all it needs to do by looking at the headers and so on.</p>
<p>But to get the depths of all the complexities involved,</p>
<p>all the options involved,</p>
<p>documentation does some of the work.</p>
<p>Documentation is essential, yeah.</p>
<p>So that was actually a, so we thought about several things.</p>
<p>One is we wanted plotting.</p>
<p>We wanted interactive environment.</p>
<p>We wanted good documentation.</p>
<p>These are things we knew, we wanted.</p>
<p>The reality is those took about 10 years to evolve, right?</p>
<p>Given the fact that we didn&rsquo;t have a big budget,</p>
<p>it was all volunteer labor.</p>
<p>It was sort of, when nthought got created</p>
<p>and they started to try to find projects,</p>
<p>people would pay for pieces</p>
<p>and they were able to fund some of it.</p>
<p>Not nearly enough to keep up with what was necessary.</p>
<p>And no criticism, just simply the reality.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to start a business</p>
<p>and then do consulting and then also</p>
<p>promote an open source project that&rsquo;s still fairly new.</p>
<p>Cypo is fairly niche.</p>
<p>We stayed connected all while I was a student,</p>
<p>sorry, a professor.</p>
<p>I went to BYU and started to teach.</p>
<p>Electrical engineering, all the applied math courses.</p>
<p>I loved teaching single processing,</p>
<p>probability theory, electromagnetism.</p>
<p>I was, if you look at writing my professor,</p>
<p>which my kids loved to do,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t, I got some bad reviews because people.</p>
<p>What was the criticism?</p>
<p>I would speak too high of a level.</p>
<p>Like I definitely had a calibration problem</p>
<p>coming out of graduate work</p>
<p>where I hate to be condescending to people.</p>
<p>Like I really have a ton of respect for people fundamentally.</p>
<p>Like my fundamental thing is I respect people.</p>
<p>Sometimes that can lead to a,</p>
<p>I was thinking they had more knowledge than they did.</p>
<p>And so I would just speak at a very high level,</p>
<p>assume they got it.</p>
<p>But they need to rise to the standard that you set.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the,</p>
<p>some of the greatest teachers do that.</p>
<p>And I agree.</p>
<p>And that was kind of what was inspiring me.</p>
<p>But you also have to,</p>
<p>I cannot say I was articulate</p>
<p>with some of the greatest teachers, right?</p>
<p>I was, like one classic example,</p>
<p>when I first taught at BYU,</p>
<p>my very first class, it was overheads,</p>
<p>transparencies, overheads.</p>
<p>Before projectors were really that common,</p>
<p>I taught transparencies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing my notes out.</p>
<p>I go in, room&rsquo;s half dark.</p>
<p>I just blaring through these transparencies.</p>
<p>Here it is, here it is, here it is.</p>
<p>And I did give a quiz after two weeks.</p>
<p>No one knew anything.</p>
<p>Nothing I had taught had gotten anywhere.</p>
<p>And I realized, okay, I&rsquo;m not, this is not working.</p>
<p>So I put away the transparencies</p>
<p>and I turned around and just started using the chalkboard.</p>
<p>And what it did is it slowed me down, right?</p>
<p>The chalkboard just slowed me down</p>
<p>and gave people time to process and to think.</p>
<p>And then that made me focus.</p>
<p>My writing wasn&rsquo;t great on the chalkboard,</p>
<p>but I really love that part of like the teaching.</p>
<p>So that entered SciPy&rsquo;s world in terms of,</p>
<p>we always understood that there&rsquo;s a didactic aspect</p>
<p>of SciPy, kind of how do you take the knowledge</p>
<p>and then produce it?</p>
<p>The challenge we had was the scope.</p>
<p>Like ultimately SciPy was everything, right?</p>
<p>And so 2001, when it first came out,</p>
<p>people were starting to use it.</p>
<p>No, this is cool, this is a tool we actually use.</p>
<p>At the same time, 2001 timeframe,</p>
<p>there was a little bit of like the Hubble Space Telescope,</p>
<p>the folks at Hubble that started to say,</p>
<p>hey, Python, we&rsquo;re gonna use Python</p>
<p>for processing images from Hubble.</p>
<p>And so Perry Greenfield was a good friend</p>
<p>in running that program.</p>
<p>And he had called me before I left WIU and said,</p>
<p>you know, we wanna do this,</p>
<p>but numeric actually has some challenges in terms of,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not, the array doesn&rsquo;t have enough types.</p>
<p>We need more operations.</p>
<p>You know, broadcasting needs to be a little more settled.</p>
<p>They wanted record arrays.</p>
<p>They wanted, you know, record arrays are like a data frame,</p>
<p>but a little bit different,</p>
<p>but they wanted more structured data.</p>
<p>So he had called me even early on then,</p>
<p>and he said, you know, what,</p>
<p>would you wanna work on something to make this work?</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, I&rsquo;m interested, but I&rsquo;m going here,</p>
<p>and I, you know, we&rsquo;ll see if I have time.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, while I was teaching</p>
<p>and SciPy was emerging, and I had a student,</p>
<p>I was constantly, while I was teaching,</p>
<p>trying to figure a way to fund this stuff.</p>
<p>So I had a graduate student, my only graduate student,</p>
<p>a Chinese fellow, Liu Hongze is his name, great guy.</p>
<p>He wrote a bunch of stuff for iterative linear algebra,</p>
<p>like got into writing some of the iterative</p>
<p>linear algebra tools that are currently there in SciPy,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gotten better since,</p>
<p>but this is in 2005, kept working on SciPy,</p>
<p>but Perry has started working on a replacement</p>
<p>to numeric called NumArray.</p>
<p>And in 2004, a package called ND Image,</p>
<p>it was an image processing library</p>
<p>that was written for NumArray,</p>
<p>and it had in it a morphology tool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know what morphology is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open, dilations, closed, you know,</p>
<p>there was sort of this, as a medical imaging student,</p>
<p>I knew what it was,</p>
<p>because it was used in segmentation a lot.</p>
<p>And in fact, I&rsquo;d wanted to do something like that</p>
<p>in Python, in SciPy, but just had never gotten around to it.</p>
<p>So when it came out, but it worked only on NumArray,</p>
<p>and SciPy needed numeric,</p>
<p>and so we effectively had the beginning of this split.</p>
<p>And numeric and NumArray didn&rsquo;t share data,</p>
<p>they were just two, so you could have a gigabyte</p>
<p>of numeric, NumArray data, and gigabyte of numeric data,</p>
<p>and they wouldn&rsquo;t share it.</p>
<p>And so you had these,</p>
<p>then you had these scientific libraries written on top.</p>
<p>I got really bugged by that.</p>
<p>I got really like, oh man, this is not good,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not cooperating now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sort of redoing each other&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just this young community.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what led me, even though I knew it was risky,</p>
<p>because my, you know, I was on a tenure track position,</p>
<p>2004 I got reviewed.</p>
<p>They said, hey, things are going okay,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing well, paper&rsquo;s coming out,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re kind of spending a lot of time</p>
<p>doing this open source stuff, maybe do a little less of that,</p>
<p>and a little more of the paper writing and grant writing,</p>
<p>which was naive, but it was definitely the thinking.</p>
<p>It still goes on.</p>
<p>Still goes on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically creating a thing</p>
<p>which enables science in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Maybe don&rsquo;t emphasize that so much in your free year tenure.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It illustrates some of the challenges.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It does, and it&rsquo;s, people mean well.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like, but we&rsquo;ve gotten broken in a bunch of ways.</p>
<p>Certain things, programming,</p>
<p>understanding the role of software engineering,</p>
<p>programming in society is a little bit lacking.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Now, I was in electrical engineering position.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even worse there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was very, they were very focused,</p>
<p>and so, you know, good people, and I had a great time,</p>
<p>I loved my time, I loved my teaching,</p>
<p>I loved all the things I did there.</p>
<p>The problem was, the split was happening</p>
<p>in this community that I loved, right?</p>
<p>I saw people, and I went, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>this is gonna be, this is not great,</p>
<p>and so I happened, you know, fate,</p>
<p>I had a class I had signed up for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, I was trying to build an MRI system,</p>
<p>so I had a kind of a radio, instead of a radio,</p>
<p>a digital radio class, it was a digital MRI class.</p>
<p>And I had people sign up, two people signed up,</p>
<p>then they dropped, and so I had nobody in this class.</p>
<p>So, and I didn&rsquo;t have any other courses to teach,</p>
<p>and I thought, oh, I&rsquo;ve got some time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just write, I&rsquo;ll just write a replace,</p>
<p>a merger of Numerica Numeray.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll basically take the numeric code base</p>
<p>at the features Numeray was adding,</p>
<p>and then kind of come up with a single array library</p>
<p>that everybody can use.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where NumPy came from,</p>
<p>was my thinking, hey, I can do this,</p>
<p>and who else is going to?</p>
<p>Because at that point, I&rsquo;d been around the community</p>
<p>long enough, and I&rsquo;d written enough C code,</p>
<p>I knew, I knew the structures, and I,</p>
<p>in fact, my first contribution to numeric</p>
<p>had been writing the CAPI documentation</p>
<p>that went in the first documentation for NumPy,</p>
<p>for numeric, sorry, this is Paul DuBois,</p>
<p>David Asher, Conrad Hinson, and myself.</p>
<p>I got credit because I wrote this chapter,</p>
<p>which is all the CAPI of Numerica, all the C stuff.</p>
<p>So I said, I&rsquo;m probably the one to do it,</p>
<p>and nobody else is gonna do this.</p>
<p>So it was sort of, out of a sense of duty and passion,</p>
<p>knowing that, eh, I don&rsquo;t think my academic,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the department here is gonna appreciate this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>It was like.</p>
<p>Can we just link on that moment?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because the importance of the way you thought</p>
<p>and the action you took, I feel is understated</p>
<p>and is rare and I would love to see so much more of it</p>
<p>because what happens as the tools become more popular,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a split that happens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a truly heroic and impactful action</p>
<p>to in those early, in that early split,</p>
<p>to step up and it&rsquo;s like great leaders throughout history,</p>
<p>like get, what is the brave heart,</p>
<p>like get on a horse and rile the troops</p>
<p>because I think that can have, make a big difference.</p>
<p>We have TensorFlow versus PyTorch</p>
<p>in the machine learning community.</p>
<p>We have the same problem today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually bigger.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible in the early days</p>
<p>to rally the troops.</p>
<p>It is possible, especially in the early days.</p>
<p>The longer it goes, the harder, right?</p>
<p>The more energy in the factions, the harder.</p>
<p>But in the early days, it is possible</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s extremely helpful</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a willingness there,</p>
<p>but the challenge is there&rsquo;s just not a willingness</p>
<p>to fund it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a willingness to, you know,</p>
<p>like I was literally walking into a field</p>
<p>saying I&rsquo;m going to do this</p>
<p>and here I am, like, you know,</p>
<p>I have five kids at home now.</p>
<p>Pressure builds.</p>
<p>Sometimes my wife hears these stories</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, you did what?</p>
<p>I thought we were going to,</p>
<p>I thought you were actually on a path</p>
<p>to make sure we had resources and money, but,</p>
<p>but again, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s an aspect,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very hopeful person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimistic person by nature.</p>
<p>I love people.</p>
<p>I learned that about myself later on.</p>
<p>And part of my, my religious beliefs</p>
<p>actually lead to that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why I hold them dear</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually how I feel about,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what leads me to these attitudes,</p>
<p>sort of this hopefulness and this sense of,</p>
<p>yeah, it may not work out for me financially</p>
<p>or maybe, but that&rsquo;s not the ultimate gain.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a thing, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the scorecard for me.</p>
<p>And so I just wanted to be helpful</p>
<p>and I knew, and partly because these SciPy conferences,</p>
<p>because the maintenance conversations,</p>
<p>I knew there was a lot of need for this, right?</p>
<p>And so I had this, it wasn&rsquo;t like I was alone</p>
<p>in terms of no feedback.</p>
<p>I had these people who knew, but it was crazy.</p>
<p>Like people who at the time said,</p>
<p>yeah, we didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be able to do it.</p>
<p>We thought it was crazy.</p>
<p>And also instructive, like practically speaking,</p>
<p>that you had a cool feature</p>
<p>that you were chasing the morphology, like the.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not just like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an end result.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some visionary thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to unite the community.</p>
<p>You were like. Correct.</p>
<p>You were actually practically,</p>
<p>this is what one person actually could do</p>
<p>and actually build.</p>
<p>Cause that is important.</p>
<p>Cause you can get over your skis.</p>
<p>You can definitely get over your skis.</p>
<p>And I had, in fact, this almost got me over my skis, right?</p>
<p>I would say, well, in retrospect, I hate looking back.</p>
<p>I can tell you all the flaws with NumPy, right?</p>
<p>When I go into it, there&rsquo;s lots of stuff that I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh man, that&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>That was wrong.</p>
<p>I wish I had somebody stop me with a wet fish there.</p>
<p>Like I needed, like what I&rsquo;d wished I&rsquo;d had</p>
<p>was somebody with more experience and certainly library</p>
<p>writing and array library.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, I wish I had me.</p>
<p>I could go back in time and go do this, do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a more important thing.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s things we did that are still there</p>
<p>that are problematic, that created challenges for later.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t understand how important that was.</p>
<p>And in many cases, didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Like there was pieces of the design of NumPy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to do until five years ago.</p>
<p>Now I know what they should have been, Ben.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know at the time and nobody,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t get the help.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I wrote it.</p>
<p>It took about, it took four months to write</p>
<p>the first version, then about 14 months to make it usable.</p>
<p>But it was, it wasn&rsquo;t, it was that first four months</p>
<p>of intense writing, coding, getting something out the door</p>
<p>that worked that was, it was, it was definitely challenging.</p>
<p>And then the big thing I did was create a new type object</p>
<p>called D type.</p>
<p>That was probably the contribution.</p>
<p>And then the fact that I added broad, not just broadcasting,</p>
<p>but advanced indexing so that you could do masked indexing</p>
<p>and indirect indexing instead of just slicing.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, and maybe you can elaborate,</p>
<p>NumPy, I guess the vision in the narrowest sense</p>
<p>is to have this object that represents</p>
<p>n dimensional arrays.</p>
<p>And like at any level of abstraction you want,</p>
<p>but basically it could be a black box</p>
<p>that you can investigate in ways that you would naturally</p>
<p>want to investigate such objects.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So you could do math on it easily.</p>
<p>Math on it easily, yeah.</p>
<p>So it had an associated library of math operations</p>
<p>and effectively SciPy became an even larger operate set</p>
<p>of math operations.</p>
<p>So the key for me was I was going to write NumPy</p>
<p>and then move SciPy to depend on NumPy.</p>
<p>In fact, early on, one of the initial proposals</p>
<p>was that we would just write SciPy</p>
<p>and it would have the numeric object inside of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be SciPy.array or something.</p>
<p>That turned out to be problematic because numeric</p>
<p>already had a little mini library of linear algebra</p>
<p>and some functions, and it had enough momentum,</p>
<p>enough users that nobody wanted to,</p>
<p>they wanted backward compatibility.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges of NumPy</p>
<p>was I had to be backward compatible</p>
<p>with both numeric and NumArray</p>
<p>in order to allow both of those communities to come together.</p>
<p>There was a ton of work in creating</p>
<p>that backward compatibility</p>
<p>that also created echoes in today&rsquo;s object.</p>
<p>Like some of the complexity in today&rsquo;s object</p>
<p>is actually from that goal of backward compatibility</p>
<p>to these other communities,</p>
<p>which if you didn&rsquo;t have that, you&rsquo;d do something different,</p>
<p>which is instructive because a lot of things are there.</p>
<p>You think, what is that there for?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s a remnant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an artifact of its historical existence.</p>
<p>By the way, I love the empathy</p>
<p>and the lack of ego behind that</p>
<p>because I feel, you see that in the split</p>
<p>in the JavaScript framework, for example,</p>
<p>the arbitrary branching.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think in order to unite people,</p>
<p>you have to kind of put your ego aside</p>
<p>and truly listen to others.</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>What do you love about NumArray?</p>
<p>What do you love about Numeric?</p>
<p>Like actually get a sense,</p>
<p>we were talking about languages earlier,</p>
<p>sort of empathize to the culture,</p>
<p>the people that love something about this particular API,</p>
<p>some of the naming style</p>
<p>or the actual usage patterns</p>
<p>and truly understand them</p>
<p>and so that you can create that same draw</p>
<p>in the united thing. I completely agree.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>And you have to also have enough passion</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be just like a perfunctory,</p>
<p>oh yes, I&rsquo;ll listen to you</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m not really that excited about it.</p>
<p>So it really is an aspect,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a philosophical, like there&rsquo;s a philia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a love of esteeming of others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually at the heart of what,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a life philosophy for me, right?</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m constantly pursuing and that helped,</p>
<p>absolutely helped.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder in a philosophical,</p>
<p>like looking at human civilization as one object,</p>
<p>it makes me wonder how we can copy and paste Travis&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in this book.</p>
<p>Well, some aspects, maybe.</p>
<p>Some aspects, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>How do we teach this?</p>
<p>How do we encourage it?</p>
<p>How do we lift it?</p>
<p>Because so much of the software world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s giant communities, right?</p>
<p>But it seems like so much is moved by,</p>
<p>like little individuals.</p>
<p>You talk about like Linus Torvalds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, could you have not,</p>
<p>could you have had Linux without him?</p>
<p>Could you?</p>
<p>Yeah, Guido and Python.</p>
<p>Guido and Python.</p>
<p>Well, the iPy community particularly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I said, we wanted to build this big thing,</p>
<p>but ultimately we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What happened is we had Mavericks and champions</p>
<p>like John Hunter who created Matplotlib.</p>
<p>We had Fernando Perez who created iPython.</p>
<p>And so we sort of inspired each other,</p>
<p>but then it kind of, there&rsquo;s sort of a culture</p>
<p>of this selfless giving, the stewardship mentality,</p>
<p>as opposed to ownership mentality,</p>
<p>but stewardship and community focused,</p>
<p>community focused, but intentional work.</p>
<p>Like not waiting for everybody else to do the work,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re doing it for the benefit of others</p>
<p>and not worried about what you&rsquo;re gonna get.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not worried about the credit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not worried about what you&rsquo;re gonna get.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re worried about, I later realized</p>
<p>that I have to worry a little about credit,</p>
<p>not because I want the credit,</p>
<p>because I want people to understand</p>
<p>what led to the results.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not about me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I want to understand this is what led to the result.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s like, I think doing,</p>
<p>and this is what had no impact on the result.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s promote, just like you said,</p>
<p>I want to promote the attributes</p>
<p>that help make us better off.</p>
<p>How do we make more of West McKinney?</p>
<p>Like West McKinney was critical to the success of Python</p>
<p>because of his creation of pandas,</p>
<p>which is the roots of that were all the way back</p>
<p>in numeric and num array and numpy,</p>
<p>where numpy created an array of records.</p>
<p>West started to use that almost like a data frame,</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s an array of records.</p>
<p>And data frame, the challenge is,</p>
<p>okay, if you want to augment it at another column,</p>
<p>you have to insert, you have to do all this memory movement</p>
<p>to insert a column.</p>
<p>Whereas data frames became,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m going to have a loose collection of arrays.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a record of arrays that is a part of a data frame.</p>
<p>And we thought about that back in the memory days,</p>
<p>but West ended up doing the work to build it.</p>
<p>And then also the operations that were relevant</p>
<p>for data processing.</p>
<p>What I noticed is just that each of these little things</p>
<p>creates just another tick, another up.</p>
<p>So numpy ultimately took a little while,</p>
<p>about six months in, people started to join me,</p>
<p>Francesc Altad, Robert Kern, Charles Harris.</p>
<p>And these people are many of the unsung heroes, I would say.</p>
<p>People who are, you know,</p>
<p>they sometimes don&rsquo;t get the credit they deserve</p>
<p>because they were critical both to support,</p>
<p>like, you know, it&rsquo;s hard and you want,</p>
<p>you need some support, people need support.</p>
<p>And I needed just encouragement.</p>
<p>And they were helping and encouraged by contributing.</p>
<p>And once, the big thing for me was when John Hunter,</p>
<p>he had previously done kind of a simple thing</p>
<p>called numerics to kind of, you know, between numeric</p>
<p>and numerae, he had a little high level tool</p>
<p>that would just select each one for matplotlib.</p>
<p>In 2006, he finally said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna just make numpy the dependency of matplotlib.</p>
<p>As soon as he did that,</p>
<p>and I remember specifically when he did that,</p>
<p>I said, okay, we&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>Like, that was when I knew we had to see success.</p>
<p>Before then it was still unsure,</p>
<p>but that kind of started a roller coaster.</p>
<p>And then 2006 to 2009.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve been floored by what it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Like, I knew it would help.</p>
<p>I had no idea how much it would help.</p>
<p>Right, so.</p>
<p>And it has to do with, again, the language thing.</p>
<p>It just, people started to think in terms of numpy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that opened up a whole new way of thinking.</p>
<p>And part of the story that you kind of mentioned,</p>
<p>but maybe you can elaborate,</p>
<p>is it seems like at some point in the story,</p>
<p>Python took over science and data science.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And bigger than that,</p>
<p>the scientific community started to think like programmers</p>
<p>or started to utilize the tools of computers to do,</p>
<p>like at a scale that wasn&rsquo;t done with Fortran.</p>
<p>Like at this gigantic scale,</p>
<p>they started to open in their heart.</p>
<p>And then Python was the thing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a few other competitors, I guess,</p>
<p>but Python, I think, really, really took over.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stories here</p>
<p>that are kind of during this journey,</p>
<p>because this is sort of the start of this journey in 2005, 2006.</p>
<p>So my tenure committee, I applied for tenure in 2006, 2007.</p>
<p>It came back, I split the department.</p>
<p>I was very polarizing.</p>
<p>I had some huge fans</p>
<p>and then some people that said no way, right?</p>
<p>So it was very, I was a polarizing figure in the department.</p>
<p>It went all the way up to the university president.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my department chair had the sway</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t say no.</p>
<p>They said, come back in two years and do it again.</p>
<p>And I went, eh, at that point, I was like,</p>
<p>I mean, I had this interest in entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>this interest in not the academic circles,</p>
<p>not the, like, how do we make industry work?</p>
<p>So I do have to give credit to that exploration of economics</p>
<p>because that led me, oh, I had a lot of opinions.</p>
<p>I was actually very libertarian at the time.</p>
<p>And I still have some libertarian trends,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m more of a, I&rsquo;m more of a collectivist libertarian.</p>
<p>So you value broadly, philosophically freedom.</p>
<p>I value broadly, philosophically freedom,</p>
<p>but I also understand the power of communities,</p>
<p>like the power of collective behavior.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s that balance, right?</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>So by the time I was just,</p>
<p>I gotta go out and explore this entrepreneur world.</p>
<p>So I left academia.</p>
<p>I said, no thanks, called my friend, Eric, here,</p>
<p>who had, his company was going.</p>
<p>I said, hey, could I join you and start this trend?</p>
<p>And he, at that time they were using SciFi a lot.</p>
<p>They were trying to get clients.</p>
<p>And so I came down to Texas.</p>
<p>And in Texas is where I sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my entrepreneur world, right?</p>
<p>I left academia and went to entrepreneur world in 2007.</p>
<p>So I moved here in 2007, kind of took a leap,</p>
<p>knew nothing really about business,</p>
<p>knew nothing about a lot of stuff there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, for a long time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kept some connections to a lot of academics</p>
<p>because I still value it.</p>
<p>I still love the scientific tradition.</p>
<p>I still value the essence and the soul and the heart</p>
<p>of what is possible.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like a lot of the administration</p>
<p>and the kind of, we can go into detail about why</p>
<p>and where and how this happens,</p>
<p>what are some of the challenges.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still affiliated with MIT.</p>
<p>I still love MIT because there&rsquo;s magic there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people I talk to, like researchers, faculty,</p>
<p>in those conversations and the whiteboard</p>
<p>and just the conversation, that&rsquo;s magic there.</p>
<p>All the other stuff, the administration,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff seems to,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna say too harshly criticize</p>
<p>sort of bureaucracies, but there&rsquo;s a lag</p>
<p>that seems to get in the way of the magic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still have a lot of hope</p>
<p>that that can change because I don&rsquo;t often see</p>
<p>that particular type of magic elsewhere in the industry.</p>
<p>So like we need that and we need that flame going.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing as exactly as you said,</p>
<p>it has the same kind of elements</p>
<p>like the open source community does.</p>
<p>And, but then if you, like the reason I stepped away,</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;m here, just like you did in Austin is like,</p>
<p>if I wanna build one robot, I&rsquo;ll stay at MIT.</p>
<p>But if I wanna build millions and make money enough</p>
<p>to where I can explore the magic of that, then you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think that dance is&hellip;</p>
<p>That translational dance has been lost a bit, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m certainly not an expert on this stuff.</p>
<p>I can opine like anybody else,</p>
<p>but I realized that I wanted to explore entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>which I, and really figure out,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been a driving passion for 20 years, 25 years.</p>
<p>How do we connect capital markets and company?</p>
<p>Cause again, I fell in love with the notion of,</p>
<p>oh, profit seeking on its own is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a coordination mechanism</p>
<p>for allocating resources that, you know,</p>
<p>in an emergent way, right?</p>
<p>That respects everybody&rsquo;s opinions, right?</p>
<p>So this is actually powerful.</p>
<p>So I say all the time, when I make a company</p>
<p>and we do something that makes profit,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re saying is, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re collecting of the world&rsquo;s resources</p>
<p>and voluntarily people are asking us</p>
<p>to do something that they like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a huge deal.</p>
<p>And so I really liked that energy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I came to do and to learn</p>
<p>and to try to figure out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been kind of stumbling through</p>
<p>since for the past 14 years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s 2007.</p>
<p>2007, yeah.</p>
<p>And so you were still working at NoPi.</p>
<p>So NoPi was just emerging.</p>
<p>Just emerging.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth mentioning because it emphasizes</p>
<p>the exploratory nature of my thinking at the time.</p>
<p>I said, well, I don&rsquo;t know how to fund this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a graduate student I&rsquo;m paying for</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got no funding for him.</p>
<p>And I had done some fundraising from the public</p>
<p>to try to get public fundraisers in my lab.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really wanna go out</p>
<p>and just do the fundraising circuit</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s traditionally done.</p>
<p>So I wrote a book and I said, I&rsquo;m gonna write a book</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna charge for it.</p>
<p>It was called Guide to NoPi.</p>
<p>And so ultimately NoPi became</p>
<p>documentation driven development</p>
<p>because I basically wrote the book</p>
<p>and made sure the stuff worked or the book would work.</p>
<p>So it really helped actually make NoPi become a thing.</p>
<p>So writing that book,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a page turner.</p>
<p>Guide to NoPi is not a book you pick up</p>
<p>and go, oh, this is great, over the fire.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s where you could find the details,</p>
<p>like how&rsquo;d all this work.</p>
<p>And a lot of people love that book.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people ended up,</p>
<p>so I said, look, I need to, so I&rsquo;m gonna charge for it.</p>
<p>And I got some flack for that.</p>
<p>Not that much, just probably five angry messages,</p>
<p>people yelling at me saying I was a bad guy</p>
<p>for charging for this book.</p>
<p>Was one of them Richard Stallman?</p>
<p>No. Just kidding.</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t really had any interaction with him personally,</p>
<p>like I said, but there were a few,</p>
<p>but actually surprisingly not.</p>
<p>There was actually a lot of people like,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s fine, you can charge for a book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p>We know that&rsquo;s a way you can try to make money</p>
<p>around open source.</p>
<p>So what I did, I did it in an interesting way.</p>
<p>I said, well, kind of my ideas around IP law and stuff.</p>
<p>I love the idea you can share something, you can spread it.</p>
<p>Like once it&rsquo;s, the fact that you have a thing</p>
<p>and copying is free, but the creation is not free.</p>
<p>So how do you fund the creation and allow the copying?</p>
<p>And in software, it&rsquo;s a little more complicated than that</p>
<p>because creation is actually a continuous thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you build a widget and it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a process of emerging</p>
<p>and continuing to create.</p>
<p>But I wrote the book</p>
<p>and had this market determined price thing.</p>
<p>I said, look, I need, I think I said 250,000.</p>
<p>If I make 250,000 from this book, I&rsquo;ll make it free.</p>
<p>So as soon as I get that much money,</p>
<p>or I said five years, so there&rsquo;s a time limit.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not forever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I released it on this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually interesting</p>
<p>because one of the people</p>
<p>who also thought that was interesting</p>
<p>ended up being Chris White,</p>
<p>who was the director of DARPA project</p>
<p>that we got funding through at Anaconda.</p>
<p>And the reason he even called us back</p>
<p>is because he remembered my name from this book</p>
<p>and he thought that was interesting.</p>
<p>And so even though we hadn&rsquo;t gone to the demo days,</p>
<p>we applied and the people said, yeah,</p>
<p>nobody ever gets this without coming to the demo day first.</p>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s because I knew, you know,</p>
<p>Chris had done this and had this interaction.</p>
<p>So it did have impact.</p>
<p>I was actually really, really pleased by the result.</p>
<p>I mean, I ended up in three years, I made 90,000.</p>
<p>So sold 30,000 copies by myself.</p>
<p>I just put it up on, you know, use PayPal and sold it.</p>
<p>And that was my first taste of kind of, okay,</p>
<p>this can work to some degree.</p>
<p>And I, you know, all over the world, right?</p>
<p>From Germany to Japan to, it was actually, it did work.</p>
<p>And so I appreciated the fact that PayPal existed</p>
<p>and I had a way to get the money, the distribution was simple.</p>
<p>This is pre Amazon book stuff.</p>
<p>So it was just publishing a website.</p>
<p>It was the popularity of SciPy emerging</p>
<p>and getting company usage.</p>
<p>I ended up not letting it go the five years</p>
<p>and not trying to make the full amount</p>
<p>because, you know, a year and a half later,</p>
<p>I was at Enthought.</p>
<p>I had left academia as an Enthought</p>
<p>and I kind of had a full time job.</p>
<p>And then actually what happened is the documentation people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a group that said, hey,</p>
<p>we want to do documentation for SciPy as a collective.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re essentially needing the stuff in the book, right?</p>
<p>And so they kind of ask,</p>
<p>hey, could we just use the stuff in your book?</p>
<p>And at that point I said, yeah, I&rsquo;ll just open it up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, but it has served its purpose.</p>
<p>And the money that I made actually funded my grad student.</p>
<p>Like it was actually, you know,</p>
<p>I paid him 25,000 a year out of that money.</p>
<p>So the funny thing is if you do a very similar</p>
<p>kind of experiment now with NumPy or something like it,</p>
<p>you could probably make a lot more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Because of the tooling and the community building.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Like the, and social media,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just a virality to that kind of idea.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be things to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about that.</p>
<p>And really I thought about a couple of books</p>
<p>or a couple of things that could be done there.</p>
<p>And I just haven&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Even, I tried to hire a ghostwriter this year too</p>
<p>to see if that could help, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But part of my problem is this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been so excited by a number of things</p>
<p>that have stemmed from that.</p>
<p>Like, so I came here, worked at Enthought for four years,</p>
<p>graciously, Eric made me president.</p>
<p>Then we started to work closely together.</p>
<p>We actually helped him buy out his partner.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t end great.</p>
<p>Like unfortunately Eric and I aren&rsquo;t real,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t friends now.</p>
<p>I still respect him.</p>
<p>I have a lot, I wish we were,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t like the fact that Peter and I</p>
<p>started Anaconda, right?</p>
<p>That was not, I mean, so there&rsquo;s two sides to that story.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna go into it, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But you, as human beings</p>
<p>and you wish you still could be friends.</p>
<p>I do, I do.</p>
<p>It saddens me.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a story of great minds</p>
<p>building great companies.</p>
<p>Somehow it&rsquo;s sad that when there&rsquo;s that kind of.</p>
<p>And I hold him in esteem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for him.</p>
<p>I think Enthought still exists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing great work helping scientists.</p>
<p>They still run the SciPy conference.</p>
<p>They have an R&amp;D platform they&rsquo;re selling now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tool that you can go get today, right?</p>
<p>So Enthought has played a role in the SciPy</p>
<p>in supporting the community around SciPy, I would say.</p>
<p>They ended up not being able to,</p>
<p>they ended up building a tool suite</p>
<p>to write GUI applications.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s where they could actually make</p>
<p>that the business could work.</p>
<p>And so supporting SciPy and NumPy itself</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t as possible.</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t, they tried.</p>
<p>I mean, it was not just because,</p>
<p>it was just because of the business aspect.</p>
<p>So, and I wanted to build a company that could do,</p>
<p>that could get venture funding, right?</p>
<p>Better for worse.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a longer story.</p>
<p>We could talk a lot about that, but.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where Anaconda came to be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Anaconda came to be.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, it&rsquo;s a little bit for fun</p>
<p>because you built this amazing thing.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s talk about like an old warrior</p>
<p>looking over old battles.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, you know, there&rsquo;s a sad letter in 2012</p>
<p>that you wrote to the NumPy mailing list</p>
<p>announcing that you&rsquo;re leaving NumPy.</p>
<p>And some of the things you&rsquo;ve listed</p>
<p>as some of the things you regret</p>
<p>or not regret necessarily, but some things to think about.</p>
<p>If you could go back and you could fix stuff about NumPy</p>
<p>or both sort of in a personal level,</p>
<p>but also like looking forward,</p>
<p>what kind of things would you like to see changed?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s technical questions</p>
<p>and social questions right there.</p>
<p>First of all, you know, I wrote NumPy as a service</p>
<p>and I spent a lot of time doing it.</p>
<p>And then other people came help make it happen.</p>
<p>NumPy succeeded because the work of a lot of people, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to understand that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity,</p>
<p>the role I had, I could play</p>
<p>and grateful that things I did had an impact,</p>
<p>but they only had the impact they had</p>
<p>because the other people that came to the story.</p>
<p>And so they were essential,</p>
<p>but the way data types were handled,</p>
<p>the way data types, we had array scalers, for example,</p>
<p>that are really just a substitute for a type concept, right?</p>
<p>So we had array scalers or actual Python objects</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s for every, for a 32 bit float</p>
<p>or a 16 bit float or a 16 bit integer,</p>
<p>Python doesn&rsquo;t have a natural,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one integer, there&rsquo;s one float.</p>
<p>Well, what about these lower precision types,</p>
<p>these larger precision types?</p>
<p>So we had them in NumPy</p>
<p>so that you could have a collection of them,</p>
<p>but then have an object in Python that was one of them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s questions about like in retrospect,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have created those</p>
<p>if it improved the type system.</p>
<p>And like made the type system actually a Python type system</p>
<p>as opposed to currently,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Python one level type system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know the difference</p>
<p>between Python one, Python two,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of technical, kind of depth,</p>
<p>but Python two, one of its big things that Guido did,</p>
<p>it was really brilliant.</p>
<p>It was the actually Python one,</p>
<p>all classes, new objects were one.</p>
<p>If you as a user wrote a class,</p>
<p>it was an instance of a single Python type</p>
<p>called the class type, right?</p>
<p>In Python two, he used a meta typing hook</p>
<p>to actually go, oh, we can extend this</p>
<p>and have users write classes that are new types.</p>
<p>So he was able to have your user classes be actual types</p>
<p>and the Python type system got a lot more rich.</p>
<p>I barely understood that at the time that NumPy was written.</p>
<p>And so I essentially in NumPy created a type system</p>
<p>that was Python one era.</p>
<p>It was every D type is an instance of the same type</p>
<p>as opposed to having new D types be really just Python types</p>
<p>with additional metadata.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the cost of that?</p>
<p>Is it efficiency, is it usability?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usability primarily.</p>
<p>The cost isn&rsquo;t really efficiency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that it&rsquo;s clumsy to create new types.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And then one of the challenges,</p>
<p>you wanna create new types.</p>
<p>You wanna quaternion type or you wanna add a new posit type</p>
<p>or you wanna, so it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And now, if we had done that well,</p>
<p>when Numba came on the scene</p>
<p>where we could actually compile Python code,</p>
<p>it would integrate with that type system much cleaner.</p>
<p>And now all of a sudden you could do gradual typing</p>
<p>more easily.</p>
<p>You could actually have Python when you add Numba</p>
<p>plus better typing, could actually be a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d smooth out a lot of rough edges.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s already, there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>but are you talking about from the perspective</p>
<p>of developers within NumPy or users of NumPy?</p>
<p>Developers of new, not really users of NumPy so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the development of NumPy.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking about like how to design NumPy</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s contributors.</p>
<p>Yeah, the contributors, it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less work to make it better and to keep it maintained.</p>
<p>And where that&rsquo;s impacted things, for example,</p>
<p>is the GPU.</p>
<p>Like all of a sudden GPUs start getting added</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have them in NumPy.</p>
<p>Like NumPy should just work on GPUs.</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;d have to download a whole other object</p>
<p>called Kupy to have arrays on GPUs</p>
<p>is just an artifact of history.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no fundamental reason for it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>If we could sort of go on that tangent briefly</p>
<p>is you have PyTorch and other libraries like TensorFlow</p>
<p>that basically tried to mimic NumPy.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve created a sort of platonic form</p>
<p>of multi dimension. Basically, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, and the problem was I didn&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>Platonic form has a lot of edges.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, well, we should cut those out</p>
<p>before we present it.</p>
<p>So I wonder if you can comment,</p>
<p>is there like a difference between their implementations?</p>
<p>Do you wish that they were all using NumPy</p>
<p>or like in this abstraction of GPU?</p>
<p>And sorry to interrupt that there&rsquo;s GPUs, ASICs.</p>
<p>There might be other neuromorphic computing.</p>
<p>There might be other kind of,</p>
<p>or the aliens will come with a new kind of computer.</p>
<p>Like an abstraction that NumPy should just operate nicely</p>
<p>over the things that are more and more</p>
<p>and smarter and smarter with this multi dimensional arrays.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several comments there.</p>
<p>We are working on something now called data dash APIs.org.</p>
<p>Data dash API.org, you can go there today.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s our answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s me and Rolf and Athen and Aaron</p>
<p>and a lot of companies are helping us at Quansight Labs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unifying all the arrays.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating an API that is unified.</p>
<p>So we do care about this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to work through it.</p>
<p>I actually had the chance to go and meet</p>
<p>with the TensorFlow team and the PyTorch team</p>
<p>and talk to them after exiting Anaconda.</p>
<p>Just talking about,</p>
<p>because the first year after leaving Anaconda in 2018,</p>
<p>I became deeply aware of this and realized that,</p>
<p>oh, this split in the array community that exists today</p>
<p>makes what I was concerned about in 2005 pretty parochial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot worse, right?</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot more people.</p>
<p>So perhaps the industry can sustain more stacks, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of money,</p>
<p>but it makes it a lot less efficient.</p>
<p>I mean, but I&rsquo;ve also learned to appreciate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to have some competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to have different implementations,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s better if you can at least refactor some parts.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re gonna be more efficient</p>
<p>if you can refactor parts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to have competition over things,</p>
<p>over what is nice to have competition.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re innovative.</p>
<p>Yeah, innovative.</p>
<p>And then maybe on the infrastructure,</p>
<p>whatever, however you define infrastructure,</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s nice to have come together.</p>
<p>Exactly, I agree.</p>
<p>And I think, but it was interesting to hear the stories.</p>
<p>I mean, TensorFlow came out of a C++ library,</p>
<p>Jeff Dean wrote, I think,</p>
<p>that was basically how they were doing inference, right?</p>
<p>And then they realized, oh,</p>
<p>we could do this TensorFlow thing.</p>
<p>That C++ library, then what was interesting to me</p>
<p>was the fact that both Google and Facebook did not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they supported Python or NumPy initially.</p>
<p>They just realized they had to.</p>
<p>They came to this world and then all the users were like,</p>
<p>hey, where&rsquo;s the NumPy interface?</p>
<p>Oh, and then they kind of came late to it</p>
<p>and then they had these bolt ons.</p>
<p>TensorFlow&rsquo;s bolt on, I don&rsquo;t mean to offend,</p>
<p>but it was so bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time that I&rsquo;m usually,</p>
<p>I mean, one of the challenges I have</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t criticize enough in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t give people input enough, you know, if.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s universally agreed upon</p>
<p>that the bolt ons on TensorFlow were.</p>
<p>But I went to, it was a talk given at Mallorca in Spain</p>
<p>and a great guy came and gave a talk and I said,</p>
<p>you should never show that API again</p>
<p>at a PyData conference.</p>
<p>Like that was, that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re taking this beautiful system we&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>and like you&rsquo;re corrupting all these poor Python people,</p>
<p>forcing them to write code like that</p>
<p>or thinking they should.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you know, they adopted Keras as their,</p>
<p>and Keras is better.</p>
<p>And so Keras, TensorFlow is fine, is reasonable,</p>
<p>but they bolted it on.</p>
<p>Facebook did too.</p>
<p>Like Facebook had their own C++ library for doing inference</p>
<p>and they also had the same reaction, they had to do this.</p>
<p>One big difference is Facebook,</p>
<p>maybe because of the way it&rsquo;s situated in part of fair,</p>
<p>part of the research library,</p>
<p>TensorFlow is definitely used and, you know,</p>
<p>they have to make, they couldn&rsquo;t just open it up</p>
<p>and let the community, you know, change what that is.</p>
<p>Cause I guess they were worried</p>
<p>about disrupting their operations.</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s been much more open to having community input</p>
<p>on the structure itself.</p>
<p>Whereas Google and TensorFlow,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really eager to have community users,</p>
<p>people use it and build the infrastructure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more walled.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s harder to become a contributor to TensorFlow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, this is very difficult question to answer</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t mean to be throwing shade at anybody,</p>
<p>but you have to wonder, it&rsquo;s the Microsoft question</p>
<p>of when you have a tool like PyTorch or TensorFlow,</p>
<p>how much are you tending to the hackers</p>
<p>and how much are you tending to the big corporate clients?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So like the ones that,</p>
<p>do you tend to the millions of people</p>
<p>that are giving you almost no money,</p>
<p>or do you tend to the few</p>
<p>that are giving you a ton of money?</p>
<p>I tend to stand with the people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Cause I feel like if you nurture the hackers,</p>
<p>you will make the right decisions in the longterm</p>
<p>that will make the companies happy.</p>
<p>I lean that way too.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>But then you have to find the right dance.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>Cause you can lean to the hackers and run out of money.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Which has been some of the challenge I&rsquo;ve faced</p>
<p>in the sense that,</p>
<p>like I would look at some of the experiments,</p>
<p>like NumPy, the fact that we have this split</p>
<p>is a factor of I wasn&rsquo;t able to collect more money</p>
<p>towards NumPy development.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t succeed in the early days</p>
<p>of getting enough financial contribution to NumPy</p>
<p>so that they could work on it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t work on it full time.</p>
<p>I had to just catch an hour here, an hour there.</p>
<p>And I basically not liked that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve wanted to be able to do something about that</p>
<p>for a long time and try to figure out how,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s lots of ways.</p>
<p>I mean, possibly one could say,</p>
<p>we had an offer from Microsoft</p>
<p>at early days of Anaconda.</p>
<p>2014, they offered to come buy us, right?</p>
<p>The problem was the right people at Microsoft</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t offer to buy us.</p>
<p>And they were still,</p>
<p>they were, it was really a,</p>
<p>we were like a second,</p>
<p>they had really bought, they just bought R,</p>
<p>the R company called,</p>
<p>it was not R studio,</p>
<p>but it was another R company that was emergent.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a,</p>
<p>well, we should also get a Python play,</p>
<p>but they were really doubling down on R.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so it was like,</p>
<p>it was where you would go to die.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, it wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it was before Satya was there.</p>
<p>Satya had just started.</p>
<p>Just started.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And the offer was coming from someone</p>
<p>two levels down from him.</p>
<p>Got you.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And if it had come from Scott Guthrie,</p>
<p>so I got a chance to meet Scott Guthrie,</p>
<p>great guy, I like him.</p>
<p>If an offer had come from him,</p>
<p>probably would be at Microsoft right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be fascinating.</p>
<p>That would be really nice actually,</p>
<p>especially given what Microsoft has since done</p>
<p>for the open source community and all those things.</p>
<p>Yes, I think they&rsquo;re doing well.</p>
<p>I really like some of the stuff they&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still working,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve hired Guido now,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve hired a lot of Python developers.</p>
<p>Wait, Guido&rsquo;s not at Microsoft?</p>
<p>Yeah, he works at Microsoft.</p>
<p>I need to.</p>
<p>Which, he retired,</p>
<p>then he came out of retirement,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s working now.</p>
<p>I was just talking to him,</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t mention this person.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I should investigate this further.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Because I know he loved Dropbox,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t sure what he was doing,</p>
<p>who he was up to.</p>
<p>Well, he was kind of saying he&rsquo;d retire,</p>
<p>but, and it&rsquo;s literally been five years</p>
<p>since I last sat down and really talked to Guido.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Guido&rsquo;s a technology expert, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a, so I came,</p>
<p>I was excited because I&rsquo;d finally figured out</p>
<p>the type system for NumPy.</p>
<p>I wanted to kind of talk about that with him,</p>
<p>and I kind of overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>Could you stay in that,</p>
<p>just for a brief moment,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a fascinating person</p>
<p>in the history of programming.</p>
<p>He is a fascinating person.</p>
<p>What have you learned from Guido</p>
<p>about programming, about life?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>A lot, actually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Guido&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You know, we have a chance to talk.</p>
<p>Some, I wouldn&rsquo;t say, you know,</p>
<p>we talk all the time.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>He may, but we talk enough to,</p>
<p>I respect his,</p>
<p>in fact, when I first started NumPy,</p>
<p>one of the first things I did was I had a,</p>
<p>I asked Guido for a meeting</p>
<p>with him and Paul Dubois in San Mateo.</p>
<p>And I went and met him for lunch.</p>
<p>And basically, to say,</p>
<p>maybe we can actually,</p>
<p>part of the strategy for NumPy</p>
<p>was to get it into Python 3,</p>
<p>and maybe be part of Python.</p>
<p>And so we talked about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cool conversation.</p>
<p>And about that approach, right?</p>
<p>I would have loved to be a flyer in the water.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>And over the years for Guido,</p>
<p>I learned,</p>
<p>so he was open.</p>
<p>Like, he was willing to listen to people&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And over the years,</p>
<p>now generally, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying universally that&rsquo;s been true,</p>
<p>but generally that&rsquo;s been true.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s willing to listen.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s willing to defer.</p>
<p>Like on the scientific side,</p>
<p>he would just kind of defer.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t really always understand</p>
<p>what we were doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d defer.</p>
<p>One place where he didn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>was we missed a matrix multiply operator.</p>
<p>Like that finally got added to Python,</p>
<p>but about 10 years later than it should have.</p>
<p>But the reason was because nobody,</p>
<p>it takes a lot of effort.</p>
<p>And I learned this while I was writing NumPy.</p>
<p>I also wrote tools to Python.</p>
<p>I began with Python Dev,</p>
<p>and I added some pieces to Python.</p>
<p>Like the memory view object.</p>
<p>I wanted the structure of NumPy into Python.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t get NumPy into Python,</p>
<p>but we got the basic structure of it into Python.</p>
<p>Like, so you could build on it.</p>
<p>Nobody did for a while,</p>
<p>but eventually database authors started to.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot better.</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>And also Antoine Petrou and Stefan Krah</p>
<p>actually fixed the memory view object.</p>
<p>Cause I wrote the underlying infrastructure in C,</p>
<p>but the Python exposure was terrible</p>
<p>until they came in and fixed it.</p>
<p>Partly because I was writing NumPy,</p>
<p>and NumPy was the Python exposure.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really care about</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have NumPy installed.</p>
<p>Anyway, Guido opened up ideas,</p>
<p>technologically brilliant.</p>
<p>Like really, I really got a lot of respect for him</p>
<p>when I saw what he did</p>
<p>with this type class merger thing.</p>
<p>It was actually tricky, right?</p>
<p>And then willing to share, willing to share his ideas.</p>
<p>So the other thing early on in 1998,</p>
<p>I said, I wrote my first extension module.</p>
<p>The reason I could is because he&rsquo;d written this blog post</p>
<p>on how to do reference counting, right?</p>
<p>And without it, I would have been lost, right?</p>
<p>But he was willing to at least try to write this post.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s been motivated early on with Python.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a computer science for everybody.</p>
<p>You kind of have this early on desire to,</p>
<p>oh, maybe we should be pushing programming to more people.</p>
<p>So he had this populist notion, I guess,</p>
<p>or populist sense to learn that there&rsquo;s a certain skill,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen it in other people too,</p>
<p>of engaging with contributors sufficiently to,</p>
<p>because when somebody engaged with you</p>
<p>and wants to contribute to you,</p>
<p>if you ignore them, they go away.</p>
<p>So building that early contributor base</p>
<p>requires real engagement with other people.</p>
<p>And he would do that.</p>
<p>Can you also comment on this tragic stepping down</p>
<p>from his position as the benevolent dictator for life</p>
<p>over the wars, you know?</p>
<p>The Walrus operator?</p>
<p>The Walrus operator was the last battle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the cause of it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you can look up, there&rsquo;s the Walrus operator,</p>
<p>which looks like a colon and equal sign.</p>
<p>Yeah, colon, equal sign.</p>
<p>And it actually does maybe the thing</p>
<p>that an equal sign should be doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe, right, exactly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just historically,</p>
<p>equal sign means something else.</p>
<p>It just means assignment.</p>
<p>So he stepped down over this.</p>
<p>What do you think about the pressure of leadership?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that, you mentioned the letter I wrote</p>
<p>in NumPy at the time.</p>
<p>That was a hard time, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s been really hard times.</p>
<p>It was hard.</p>
<p>You get criticized, right?</p>
<p>And you get pushed, and you get,</p>
<p>not everybody loves what you do.</p>
<p>Like anytime you do anything that has impact at all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not universally loved, right?</p>
<p>You get some real critics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an important energy,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s impossible for you to do everything right.</p>
<p>You need people to be pushing.</p>
<p>But sometimes people can get mean, right?</p>
<p>People can, I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t immediately assume they have bad intentions.</p>
<p>And maybe for other, maybe that doesn&rsquo;t happen for everybody.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, their past,</p>
<p>their experiences with people, they sometimes have bad,</p>
<p>so they immediately attribute to you bad intentions.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like, where did this come from?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m definitely open to criticism,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;re misinterpreting the whole point.</p>
<p>Because I would get that, certainly when I started Anaconda.</p>
<p>Sometimes I say to people,</p>
<p>I care enough about entrepreneurship</p>
<p>to make some open source people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And I care enough about open source</p>
<p>to make investors uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So I sort of, you create kind of doubters on both sides.</p>
<p>So when you have, and this is just a plea</p>
<p>to the listener and the public, I&rsquo;ve noticed this too,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a tendency, and social media makes this worse,</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have perfect information about the situation,</p>
<p>you tend to fill the gaps with the worst possible,</p>
<p>or at least a bad story that fills those gaps.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s good to live life,</p>
<p>maybe not fully naively, but filling in the gaps</p>
<p>with the good, with the best, with the positive,</p>
<p>with the hopeful explanation of why you see this.</p>
<p>So if you see somebody like you trying to make money</p>
<p>on a book about an umpire,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a million stories around that that are positive.</p>
<p>And those are good to think about,</p>
<p>to project positive intent on the people.</p>
<p>Because for many reasons, usually because people are good</p>
<p>and they do have good intent.</p>
<p>And also when you project that positive intent,</p>
<p>people will step up to that too.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>It has this kind of viral nature to it.</p>
<p>And of course with Twitter, early on figured out,</p>
<p>and Facebook is that they can make a lot of money</p>
<p>and engagement from the negative.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this, we&rsquo;re fighting this mechanism.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Which is challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just easier to be.</p>
<p>To be negative.</p>
<p>And then for some reason, something in our minds</p>
<p>really enjoys sharing that and getting all excited</p>
<p>about the negativity.</p>
<p>We do, yeah.</p>
<p>Some protective mechanism perhaps that we&rsquo;re gonna get eaten</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t, yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>For us to be effective as a group of people</p>
<p>in a software engineering project,</p>
<p>you have to project positive intent, I think.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>and so that happens in this space.</p>
<p>But Python has done a reasonable job in the past,</p>
<p>but here is a situation where I think it started</p>
<p>to get this pressure where it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t know enough about what happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to several people about it.</p>
<p>And I know most of the steering committee members today,</p>
<p>one person nominated me for that role,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the wrong role for me right now, right?</p>
<p>I have a lot of respect for the Python developer space</p>
<p>and the Python developers.</p>
<p>I also understand the gap between computer science</p>
<p>Python developers and array programming developers</p>
<p>or science developers.</p>
<p>And in fact, Python succeeds in the array space</p>
<p>the more it has people in that boundary.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s often very few.</p>
<p>Like I was playing a role in that boundary</p>
<p>and working like everything to try to keep up</p>
<p>with even what Guido was saying, like I&rsquo;m a C programmer,</p>
<p>but not a computer scientist.</p>
<p>Like I was an engineer and physicist and mathematician,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t always understand</p>
<p>what they were talking about</p>
<p>and why they would have opinions the way they did.</p>
<p>So, you know, you have to listen and try to understand.</p>
<p>Then you also have to explain your point of view</p>
<p>in a way they can understand.</p>
<p>And that takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>And that communication is always the challenge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re describing here</p>
<p>about the negativity is just another form of that.</p>
<p>Like how do we come together?</p>
<p>And it does appear we&rsquo;re wired anyway</p>
<p>to at least have a, there&rsquo;s a part of us</p>
<p>that will enemy, you know, friend, enemy.</p>
<p>And we see, yeah, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why are we wiring on the enemy front?</p>
<p>So why are we pushing that?</p>
<p>Why are we promoting that so deeply?</p>
<p>Assume friend until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So, cause you have such a fascinating mind in all of this.</p>
<p>Let me just ask you these questions.</p>
<p>So one interesting side on the Python history</p>
<p>is the move from Python two to Python three.</p>
<p>You mentioned move from Python one to Python two,</p>
<p>but the move from Python two to Python three</p>
<p>is a little bit interesting</p>
<p>because it took a very long time.</p>
<p>It broke, you know, quite a small way</p>
<p>backward compatibility, but even that small way</p>
<p>seemed to have been very painful for people.</p>
<p>Is there lessons you draw?</p>
<p>Oh man, tons of lessons.</p>
<p>From how long it took and how painful it seemed to be?</p>
<p>Yeah, tons of lessons.</p>
<p>Well, I mentioned here earlier</p>
<p>that NumPy was written in 2005.</p>
<p>It was in 2005 that I actually went to Guido</p>
<p>to talk about getting NumPy into Python three.</p>
<p>Like my strategy was to,</p>
<p>oh, we were moving to Python three.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have that be, and it seems funny in retrospect</p>
<p>because like, wait, Python three,</p>
<p>that was in 2020, right?</p>
<p>When we finally ended the support for Python two</p>
<p>or at least 2017.</p>
<p>The reason it took a long time,</p>
<p>a lot of time, I think it was because one of the things is</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t much to like about Python three.</p>
<p>3.0, 3.1, it really wasn&rsquo;t until 3.3.</p>
<p>Like I consider Python 3.3 to be Python 3.0.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until Python 3.3</p>
<p>that I felt there&rsquo;s enough stuff in it</p>
<p>to make it worth anybody using it, right?</p>
<p>And then 3.4 started to be, oh yeah, I want that.</p>
<p>And then 3.5 as the matrix multiply operator,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s like, okay, we gotta use that.</p>
<p>Plus the libraries that started leveraging</p>
<p>some of the features of Python three.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So it really, the challenge was it was,</p>
<p>but it also illustrated a truism that, you know,</p>
<p>when you have inertia,</p>
<p>when you have a group of people using something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to move them away from it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just change the world on them.</p>
<p>And Python three, you know, made some,</p>
<p>I think it fixed some things Guido had always hated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he didn&rsquo;t like the fact</p>
<p>that print was a statement.</p>
<p>He wanted to make it a function.</p>
<p>But in some sense, that&rsquo;s a bit of gratuitous change</p>
<p>to the language.</p>
<p>And you could argue, and people have,</p>
<p>but one of the challenges was there wasn&rsquo;t enough features</p>
<p>and too many just changes without features.</p>
<p>And so the empathy for the end user</p>
<p>as to why they would switch wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I think also it illustrated just the funding realities.</p>
<p>Like Python wasn&rsquo;t funded.</p>
<p>Like it was also a project</p>
<p>with a bunch of volunteer labor, right?</p>
<p>It had more people, so more volunteer labor,</p>
<p>but it was still, it was fun in the sense</p>
<p>that at least Guido had a job.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned some of the behind the scenes on that now</p>
<p>since talking to people who have lived through it</p>
<p>and maybe not on air, we can talk about some of that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to see, but Guido had a job,</p>
<p>but his full time job wasn&rsquo;t just work on Python.</p>
<p>Like he had other things to do.</p>
<p>Just wild.</p>
<p>It is wild, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wild how few people are funded.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And how much impact they have.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a feature not a bug, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>At least early on, like it&rsquo;s sort of, I know, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Olympic athletes are often severely underfunded,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s what brings out the greatness.</p>
<p>Perhaps, yes, correct.</p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the essential part of it.</p>
<p>Because I do think about that in terms of,</p>
<p>I currently have an incubator for open source startups.</p>
<p>Like what I&rsquo;m trying to do right now</p>
<p>is create the environment I wished had existed</p>
<p>when I was leaving academia with NumPy</p>
<p>and trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to create those opportunities and environments.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s what drives me still,</p>
<p>is how do I make the world easier</p>
<p>for the open source entrepreneur?</p>
<p>So let me stay, I mean, I could probably stay on NumPy</p>
<p>for a long time, but this is fun question.</p>
<p>So Andre Kapathy leads the Tesla Autopilot team,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s also one of the most like legit programmers I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he builds stuff from scratch a lot,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how he builds intuition about how a problem works.</p>
<p>He just builds it from scratch, and I always love that.</p>
<p>And the primary language he uses is Python</p>
<p>for the intuition building.</p>
<p>But he posted something on Twitter saying</p>
<p>that they got a significant improvement</p>
<p>on some aspect of their like data loading, I think,</p>
<p>by switching away from np.square root,</p>
<p>so the NumPy&rsquo;s implementation of square root,</p>
<p>to math.square root, and then somebody else commented</p>
<p>that you can get even a much greater improvement</p>
<p>by using the vanilla Python square root, which is like.</p>
<p>Power 0.5.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to me, I just wanted to.</p>
<p>So that was some shade throwing at some.</p>
<p>No, no, and yes, we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to ask the trade off</p>
<p>between usability and efficiency broadly in NumPy,</p>
<p>but also on these specific weird quirks</p>
<p>of like a single function.</p>
<p>Yep, so on that point, if you use a NumPy math function</p>
<p>on a scaler, it&rsquo;s gonna be slower</p>
<p>than using a Python function on that scaler.</p>
<p>But because the math object in NumPy is more complicated,</p>
<p>because you can also call that math object on an array.</p>
<p>And so effectively, it goes through a similar machine.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t enough of the, which you would do</p>
<p>and you could do like checks and fast paths.</p>
<p>So yeah, if you&rsquo;re basically doing a list,</p>
<p>if you run over a list, in fact,</p>
<p>for problems that are less than 1,000,</p>
<p>even maybe 10,000 is probably the,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going more than 10,000,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you definitely need to be using arrays.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re less than that, and for reading,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing a reading process</p>
<p>and essentially it&rsquo;s not compute bound, it&rsquo;s IO bound.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re really taking lists of 1,000 at a time</p>
<p>and doing work on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could be faster just using Python,</p>
<p>straight up Python.</p>
<p>See, but also, and this is the side to the top,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the fundamental questions</p>
<p>when you look at the long arc of history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that np.square root is much faster.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>So like in terms of like, don&rsquo;t worry about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the evils of over optimization or whatever,</p>
<p>all the different quotes around that,</p>
<p>is sometimes obsessing about this particular little quark</p>
<p>is not sufficient.</p>
<p>For somebody like, if you&rsquo;re trying to optimize your path,</p>
<p>I mean, I agree, premature optimization</p>
<p>creates all kinds of challenges, right?</p>
<p>Because now, but you may have to do it.</p>
<p>I believe the quote is, it&rsquo;s the root of all evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the root of all evil, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give Donald Knuth, I think,</p>
<p>or is he more than somebody else?</p>
<p>Well, Doc Knuth is kind of like Mark Twain,</p>
<p>people just attribute stuff to him, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fine because he&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So, no, I was a LaTeX user myself,</p>
<p>and so I have a lot of respect,</p>
<p>and he did more than that, of course,</p>
<p>but yeah, someone I really appreciate</p>
<p>in the computer science space.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, I think that&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of little things like that,</p>
<p>where people actually, if you understood it,</p>
<p>you go, yeah, of course, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And the other part, the other part I didn&rsquo;t mention,</p>
<p>and Numba was a thing we wrote early on,</p>
<p>and I was really excited by Numba</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something we wanted,</p>
<p>it was a compiler for Python syntax,</p>
<p>and I wanted it from the beginning of writing NumPy</p>
<p>because of this function question,</p>
<p>like taking, the power of arrays</p>
<p>is really that you can write functions using all of it.</p>
<p>It has implicit looping, right?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t worry about,</p>
<p>I write this n dimensional for loop</p>
<p>with four loops, four, four statements.</p>
<p>You just say, oh, big four dimensional array,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do this operation, this plus, this minus,</p>
<p>this reduction, and you get this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called vectorization in other areas,</p>
<p>but you can basically think at a high level</p>
<p>and get massive amounts of computation done</p>
<p>with the added benefit of,</p>
<p>oh, it can be paralyzed easily.</p>
<p>It can be put in parallel.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to think about that.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s worse to go decompose your,</p>
<p>you write the for loops</p>
<p>and then try to infer parallelism from for loops.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a harder problem</p>
<p>than to take the array problem</p>
<p>and just automatically parallelize that problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, and so functions in NumPy</p>
<p>are called universal functions, ufuncs.</p>
<p>So square root is an example of a ufunk.</p>
<p>There are others, sine, cosine, add, subtract.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the first libraries to SciPy</p>
<p>was something called Special</p>
<p>where I added Bessel functions</p>
<p>and all these special functions that come up in physics</p>
<p>and I added them as ufuncs so they could work on arrays.</p>
<p>So I understood ufuncs very, very well</p>
<p>from day one inside of numeric.</p>
<p>That was one of the things we tried to make better</p>
<p>in NumPy was how do they work?</p>
<p>Can they do broadcasting?</p>
<p>What does broadcasting mean?</p>
<p>But one of the problems is, okay,</p>
<p>what do I do with a Python scaler?</p>
<p>So what happens, the Python scaler gets broadcast</p>
<p>to a zero dimensional array</p>
<p>and then it goes through the whole same machinery</p>
<p>as if it were a 10,000 dimensional array.</p>
<p>And then it kind of unpacks the element</p>
<p>and then does the addition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to mention the function it calls</p>
<p>in the case of square root</p>
<p>is just the clib square root, right?</p>
<p>In some cases, like Python&rsquo;s power,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some optimizations they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that could be faster</p>
<p>than just calling this the clib square root.</p>
<p>In the interpreter or in the?</p>
<p>No, in the C code, in the Python runtime.</p>
<p>In the Python runtime, so they really optimize it</p>
<p>and they have the freedom to do that</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have to worry about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a scaler.</p>
<p>Right, they don&rsquo;t have to worry about the fact</p>
<p>that, oh, this could be an object with many pieces.</p>
<p>The ufunc machine is also generic</p>
<p>in sense that typecasting and broadcasting,</p>
<p>broadcasting&rsquo;s idea of I&rsquo;m gonna go,</p>
<p>I have a zero dimensional array,</p>
<p>I have a scaler with a four dimensional array</p>
<p>and I add them.</p>
<p>Oh, I have to kind of coerce the shape of this guy</p>
<p>to make it work against the whole four dimensional array.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the idea of I can do a one dimensional array</p>
<p>against a two dimensional array and have it make sense.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what NumPy does is it challenges you</p>
<p>to reformulate, rethink your problem</p>
<p>as a multi dimensional array problem</p>
<p>versus move away from scalers completely.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s where some of the edge cases boundaries are</p>
<p>is that, well, they&rsquo;re still there</p>
<p>and this is where array scalers are particular.</p>
<p>So array scalers are particularly bad</p>
<p>in the sense that they were written</p>
<p>so that you could optimize the math on them,</p>
<p>but that hasn&rsquo;t happened.</p>
<p>And so their default is to coerce the array scaler</p>
<p>to a zero dimensional array</p>
<p>and then use the NumPy machinery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, and you could specialize,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t happen all the time.</p>
<p>So in fact, when we first wrote Numba,</p>
<p>we do comparisons and say, look, it&rsquo;s 1000X speed up.</p>
<p>We were lying a little bit in the sense that,</p>
<p>well, first do the 40X slowdown</p>
<p>of using the array scalers inside of a loop.</p>
<p>Cause if you used to use Python scalers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d already be 10 times faster.</p>
<p>But then we would get a hundred times faster</p>
<p>over that using just compilation.</p>
<p>But what we do is compile the loop</p>
<p>from out of the interpreter to machine code.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s always been the power of Python</p>
<p>is this extensibility so that you can,</p>
<p>cause people say, oh, Python&rsquo;s so slow.</p>
<p>Well, sure, if you do all your logic</p>
<p>in the runtime of the Python interpreter, yeah.</p>
<p>But the power is that you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>You write all the logic,</p>
<p>what you do in the high level is just high level logic.</p>
<p>And the actual calls you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>could be on gigabyte arrays of data.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all done at compiled speeds.</p>
<p>And the fact that integration is one can happen,</p>
<p>but two is separable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the, the language like Julia says,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be all in one.</p>
<p>You can do all of it together.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, the jury&rsquo;s out, is that possible?</p>
<p>I tend to think that you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s separate concerns there.</p>
<p>You want to precompile.</p>
<p>In fact, generally you will want to precompile your,</p>
<p>some of your loops.</p>
<p>Like SciPy is a compilation step.</p>
<p>To install SciPy, it takes about two hours.</p>
<p>If you have many machines,</p>
<p>maybe you can get it down to one hour.</p>
<p>But to compile those libraries takes about, takes a while.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to do that at runtime.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to do that all the time.</p>
<p>You want to have this precompiled binary available</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re then just linking into.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s real questions about the whole source code.</p>
<p>Code is, running binary code is more than source code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating object code, it&rsquo;s the linker, it&rsquo;s the loader,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the how does that interpret it</p>
<p>inside of virtual memory space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of details there that actually</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand for a long time</p>
<p>until I read books on the topic.</p>
<p>And it led to, the more you know, the better off you are</p>
<p>and you can do more details,</p>
<p>but sometimes it helps with abstractions too.</p>
<p>Well, the problem, as we mentioned earlier</p>
<p>with abstractions is you kind of sometimes assume</p>
<p>that whoever implemented this thing</p>
<p>had your case in mind and found the optimal solution.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or like you assume certain things.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>One of the really powerful things to me early on,</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds silly to say, but with Python,</p>
<p>probably one of the reasons I fell in love with it</p>
<p>is dictionaries.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So obviously probably most languages</p>
<p>have some mapping concept,</p>
<p>but it felt like it was a first class citizen</p>
<p>and it was just my brain was able to think in dictionaries.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the thing that I guess I still use</p>
<p>to this day is order dictionaries</p>
<p>because that seems like a more natural way</p>
<p>to construct dictionaries.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And from a computer science perspective,</p>
<p>the running time cost is not that significant,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of things to understand about dictionaries</p>
<p>that the abstraction kind of</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily incentivize you to understand.</p>
<p>Right, do you really understand the notion of a hash map</p>
<p>and how the dictionary is implemented?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are a good example</p>
<p>of an abstraction that&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>And I agree with you.</p>
<p>I agree, I love dictionaries too.</p>
<p>Took me a while to understand that once you do,</p>
<p>you realize, oh, they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>And Python uses them everywhere too.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s actually constructed,</p>
<p>one of the foundational things is dictionaries</p>
<p>and it does everything with dictionaries.</p>
<p>So it is, it&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>Order dictionaries came later,</p>
<p>but it is very, very powerful.</p>
<p>It took me a little while coming</p>
<p>from just the array programming entirely</p>
<p>to understand these other objects,</p>
<p>like dictionaries and lists and tuples and binary trees.</p>
<p>Like I said, I wasn&rsquo;t a computer scientist,</p>
<p>I studied arrays first.</p>
<p>And so I was very array centric.</p>
<p>And you realize, oh, these others</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have purposes and value actually.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a friendliness about,</p>
<p>like one way to think about arrays</p>
<p>is arrays are just like full of numbers,</p>
<p>but to make them accessible to humans</p>
<p>and make them less error prone to human users,</p>
<p>sometimes you want to attach names,</p>
<p>human interpretable names</p>
<p>that are sticky to those arrays.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how you start to think about dictionaries</p>
<p>is you start to convert numbers</p>
<p>into something that&rsquo;s human interpretable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the tension I&rsquo;ve had with NumPy</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve built so much tooling</p>
<p>around human interpretability</p>
<p>and also protecting me from a year later</p>
<p>not making the mistakes by being,</p>
<p>I wanted to force myself to use English versus numbers.</p>
<p>Yes, so there&rsquo;s a project called Labeled Arrays.</p>
<p>Like very early it was recognized that,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re indexing NumPy with just numbers,</p>
<p>all the columns and particularly the dimensions.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have an image,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to label each column or row,</p>
<p>but if you have a lot of images</p>
<p>or you have another dimension,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d at least like to label the dimension</p>
<p>as this is X, this is Y, this is Z,</p>
<p>or this is give us some human meaning</p>
<p>or some domain specific meaning.</p>
<p>That was one of the impetuses for Pandas actually</p>
<p>was just, oh, we do need to label these things.</p>
<p>And Label Array was an attempt to add</p>
<p>that like a lighter weight version of that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been, like, that&rsquo;s an example of something</p>
<p>I think NumPy could add, could be added to NumPy,</p>
<p>but one of the challenges again, how do you fund this?</p>
<p>Like I said, one of the tragedies I think is that,</p>
<p>so I never had the chance to,</p>
<p>I was never paid to work on NumPy, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always just done it in my spare time,</p>
<p>always taken from one thing,</p>
<p>taken from another thing to do it.</p>
<p>And at the time, I mean, today,</p>
<p>it would be the wrong day and today,</p>
<p>like paying me to work on NumPy now</p>
<p>would not be a good use of effort,</p>
<p>but we are finally at Quansight Labs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually paying people to work on NumPy and SciPy,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;m thrilled with, I&rsquo;m excited by.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I always wanted to do from day one.</p>
<p>It just took me a while to figure out a mechanism to do that.</p>
<p>Even like in the university setting,</p>
<p>respecting that, like pushing students,</p>
<p>young minds and young graduate students to contribute</p>
<p>and then figuring out financial mechanisms</p>
<p>that enable them to contribute</p>
<p>and then sort of reward them</p>
<p>for their innovative scientific journey,</p>
<p>that would be nice.</p>
<p>But then also just a better allocation of resources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 20 year anniversary since 9.11</p>
<p>and I was just looking, we spent over $6 trillion</p>
<p>in the Middle East after 9.11 in the various efforts there.</p>
<p>And sort of to put politics and all that aside,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, you think about the education system,</p>
<p>all the other ways we could have</p>
<p>possibly allocated that money.</p>
<p>To me, to take it back,</p>
<p>the amount of impact you would have</p>
<p>by allocating a little bit of money to the programmers</p>
<p>that build the tools that run the world is fascinating.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think, again,</p>
<p>there is some aspect to being broke</p>
<p>as somewhat of a feature, not a bug,</p>
<p>that you make sure that you&rsquo;re valued.</p>
<p>But you can still manage that.</p>
<p>Right, no, I know.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a big part.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I think you can have enough money</p>
<p>and actually be wealthy while maintaining your values.</p>
<p>Agreed, agreed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an old adage that nations that trade together</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go to war together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought about nations that code together.</p>
<p>Yeah, code together.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Because one of the things I love about open source</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s global, it&rsquo;s multinational.</p>
<p>Like there aren&rsquo;t national boundaries.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with business and open source</p>
<p>is the fact that, well, business is national.</p>
<p>Like businesses are entities</p>
<p>that are recognized in legal jurisdictions, right?</p>
<p>And have laws that are respected in those jurisdictions</p>
<p>and hiring, and yet the open source ecosystem</p>
<p>is not, it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Like currently, one of the problems we&rsquo;re solving</p>
<p>is hiring people all over the world, right?</p>
<p>Because we, it&rsquo;s a global effort.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had the chance to work, and I&rsquo;ve loved the chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to like Iran,</p>
<p>but I once had a conference</p>
<p>where I was able to talk to people there, right?</p>
<p>And talk to folks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been there, but we had a call</p>
<p>where there were people there,</p>
<p>like just scientists and normal people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain amount of humanizing, right?</p>
<p>That gets away from the,</p>
<p>like we often get the memes of society</p>
<p>that bubble up and get discussed,</p>
<p>but the memes are not even an accurate reflection</p>
<p>of the reality of what people are.</p>
<p>Well, if you look at the major power centers</p>
<p>that are leading to something like cyber war</p>
<p>in the next few decades,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the United States, it&rsquo;s Russia, and China.</p>
<p>And those three countries in particular</p>
<p>have incredible developers.</p>
<p>So if they work together, I think that&rsquo;s one way,</p>
<p>the politicians can do their stupid bickering,</p>
<p>but like there&rsquo;s a layer of infrastructure, of humanity.</p>
<p>If they collaborate together,</p>
<p>that I think can prevent major military conflict,</p>
<p>which would, I think most likely happen at the cyber level</p>
<p>versus the actual hot war level.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You know, I think that&rsquo;s a good prediction.</p>
<p>Nations that code together don&rsquo;t go to war together.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go to war together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hope, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the philosophical hopes, but yeah.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the project of Numba,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>So from the early days,</p>
<p>there was kind of a pushback on Python that it&rsquo;s not fast.</p>
<p>You know, you see C plus,</p>
<p>if you wanna write something that&rsquo;s fast,</p>
<p>you use C plus plus.</p>
<p>If you wanna write something that&rsquo;s usable and friendly,</p>
<p>but slow, you use Python.</p>
<p>And so what is Numba?</p>
<p>What is its goal?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>Great, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what the argument.</p>
<p>And the reality was people would write high level coding</p>
<p>and use compiled code,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still user stories, use cases,</p>
<p>where you want to write Python,</p>
<p>but then have it still be fast.</p>
<p>You still need to write a for loop.</p>
<p>Like before Numba, it was always don&rsquo;t write a for loop.</p>
<p>You know, write it in a vectorized way,</p>
<p>you know, put it in an array.</p>
<p>And often that can make a memory trade off.</p>
<p>Like quite often you can do it,</p>
<p>but then you make maybe use more memory</p>
<p>because you have to build this array of data</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t necessarily need all the time.</p>
<p>So Numba was, it started from a desire to have</p>
<p>kind of a vectorized that worked.</p>
<p>A vectorized was a tool in NumPy, it was released.</p>
<p>You give it a Python function</p>
<p>and it gave you a universal function,</p>
<p>a ufunc that would work on arrays.</p>
<p>So you get the function that just worked on a scaler.</p>
<p>Like you could make a,</p>
<p>like the classic case was a simple function</p>
<p>that an if then statement in it.</p>
<p>So sine X over X function, sync function.</p>
<p>If X equals zero, return one, otherwise do sine X over X.</p>
<p>The challenge is you don&rsquo;t want that loop</p>
<p>peg one in Python.</p>
<p>So you want a compiled version of that,</p>
<p>but the ufunc, the vectorized in NumPy</p>
<p>would just give you a Python function.</p>
<p>So it would take the array of numbers</p>
<p>and at every call do a loop back into Python.</p>
<p>So it was very slow.</p>
<p>It gave you the appearance of a ufunc,</p>
<p>but it was very slow.</p>
<p>So I always wanted a vectorized</p>
<p>that would take that Python scaler function</p>
<p>and produce a ufunc working on binary native code.</p>
<p>So in fact, I had somebody work on that with PyPy</p>
<p>and see if PyPy could be used to produce a ufunc like that</p>
<p>early on in 2009 or something like that, 2010.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t work that well.</p>
<p>It was kind of pretty bulky.</p>
<p>But in 2012, Peter and I had just started Anaconda.</p>
<p>We had, I just, I&rsquo;d learned to raise money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different topic,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d learned to raise money from friends, family,</p>
<p>and fools, as they say.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>But, so we were trying to do something.</p>
<p>We were trying to change the world.</p>
<p>Peter and I are super ambitious.</p>
<p>We wanted to make array computing</p>
<p>and we had ideas for really what&rsquo;s still,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still the energy right now.</p>
<p>How do you do at scale data science?</p>
<p>And we had a bunch of ideas there, but one of them,</p>
<p>I had just talked to people about LLVM</p>
<p>and I was like, there&rsquo;s a way to do this.</p>
<p>I just, I went, I heard about my friend Dave Beasley</p>
<p>at a compiler course.</p>
<p>So I was looking at compilers like,</p>
<p>and I realized, oh, this is what you do.</p>
<p>And so I wrote a version of Numba</p>
<p>that just basically mapped Python bytecode to LLVM.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Right, so, and the first version is like, this works</p>
<p>and it produces code that&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>This is cool for, you know,</p>
<p>obviously a reduced subset of Python.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t support all the Python language.</p>
<p>There had been efforts to speed up Python in the past,</p>
<p>but those efforts were, I would say,</p>
<p>not from the array computing perspective,</p>
<p>not from the perspective of wanting to produce</p>
<p>a vectorized improvement.</p>
<p>They were from the perspective of speeding up</p>
<p>the runtime of Python, which is fundamentally hard</p>
<p>because Python allows for some constructs</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t speed up.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s this generic, you know, when it does this variable.</p>
<p>So I, from the start, did not try to replicate</p>
<p>Python&rsquo;s semantics entirely.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m gonna take a subset of the Python syntax</p>
<p>and let people write syntax in Python,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of a new language really.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like four loops, like focusing on four loops.</p>
<p>Four loops, scalar arithmetic, you know, typed,</p>
<p>you know, really typed language, a typed subset.</p>
<p>That was the key.</p>
<p>So, but we wanted to add inference of types.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t have to spell all the types out</p>
<p>because when you call a function,</p>
<p>so Python is typed, it&rsquo;s just dynamically typed.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t tell it what the types are,</p>
<p>but when it runs, every time an object runs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a type for the variables.</p>
<p>You know what it is.</p>
<p>And so that was the design goals of Numba</p>
<p>were to make it possible to write functions</p>
<p>that could be compiled and have them used for NumPy arrays.</p>
<p>Like they needed to support NumPy arrays.</p>
<p>And so how does it work?</p>
<p>Do you add a comment within Python that tells it to do,</p>
<p>like how do you help out the compiler?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there isn&rsquo;t much actually.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s kind of magical in the sense</p>
<p>that it just looks at the type of the objects</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s typed inference to determine</p>
<p>any other variables it needs.</p>
<p>And then it was also, because we had a use case</p>
<p>that could work early.</p>
<p>Like one of the challenges of any kind of new development</p>
<p>is if you have something that to make it work,</p>
<p>it was gonna take you a long time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get out off the ground.</p>
<p>If you have a project where there&rsquo;s some incremental story,</p>
<p>it can start working today and solve a problem,</p>
<p>then you can start getting it out there, getting feedback.</p>
<p>Because Numba today, now Numba is nine years old today,</p>
<p>the first two, three versions were not great, right?</p>
<p>But they solved a problem and some people could try it</p>
<p>and we could get some feedback on it.</p>
<p>Not great in that it was very focused.</p>
<p>Very fragile, the subset it would actually compile</p>
<p>was small and so if you wrote Python code</p>
<p>and said, so the way it worked is you write a function</p>
<p>and you say at JIT, use decorators.</p>
<p>So decorators, just these little constructs</p>
<p>let you decorate code with an at and then a name.</p>
<p>The at JIT would take your Python function</p>
<p>and actually just compile it and replace the Python function</p>
<p>with another function that interacts</p>
<p>with this compiled function.</p>
<p>And it would just do that and we went from Python bytecode</p>
<p>then we went to AST.</p>
<p>I mean, writing compilers actually,</p>
<p>I learned a lot about why computer science</p>
<p>is taught the way it is because compilers</p>
<p>can be hard to write.</p>
<p>They use tree structures, they use all the concepts</p>
<p>of computer science that are needed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually hard to, it&rsquo;s easy to write a compiler</p>
<p>and then have it be spaghetti code.</p>
<p>Like the passes become challenging</p>
<p>and we ended up with three versions of Numba, right?</p>
<p>Numba got written three times.</p>
<p>What programming language is Numba written in?</p>
<p>Python.</p>
<p>Wait, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, Python.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Python, but then the whole goal of Numba</p>
<p>is to translate Python bytecode to LLVM.</p>
<p>And so LLVM actually does the code generation.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of times they&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s super easy to write a compiler</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not writing the parser nor the code generator.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, LLVM is a compiler itself.</p>
<p>So your compiler.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really badly named low level virtual machine,</p>
<p>which that part of it is not used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really low level.</p>
<p>Chris, he doesn&rsquo;t mean that.</p>
<p>Yeah, love Chris.</p>
<p>But the name makes you imply that the virtual machine</p>
<p>is what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the IR and the library,</p>
<p>the code generation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real beauty of it.</p>
<p>The fact that, what I love about LLVM</p>
<p>was the fact that it was a plateau you could collaborate on.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Instead of the internals of GCC</p>
<p>or the internals of the Intel compiler,</p>
<p>or like how do I extend that?</p>
<p>And it was a place we could collaborate.</p>
<p>And we were early.</p>
<p>I mean, people had started before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slow compiler.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not a fast compiler.</p>
<p>So for some kind of JITs,</p>
<p>like JITs are common in language</p>
<p>because one, every browser has a JavaScript JIT.</p>
<p>It does real time compilation</p>
<p>of the JavaScript to machine code.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, JIT is just in time compilation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, just in time compilation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually really sophisticated.</p>
<p>In fact, I got jealous of how much effort</p>
<p>was put into the JavaScript JITs.</p>
<p>Yes, well, it&rsquo;s kind of incredible what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Yes, I completely agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed.</p>
<p>But you know, Numba was an effort</p>
<p>to make that happen with Python.</p>
<p>And so we used some of the money</p>
<p>we raised from Anaconda to do it.</p>
<p>And then we also applied for this DARPA grant</p>
<p>and used some of that money to continue the development.</p>
<p>And then we used proceeds from service projects we would do.</p>
<p>We get consulting projects</p>
<p>that we would then use some of the profits</p>
<p>to invest in Numba.</p>
<p>So we ended up with a team of two or three people</p>
<p>working on Numba.</p>
<p>It was a fits and starts, right?</p>
<p>And ultimately, the fact that we had a commercial version</p>
<p>of it also we were writing.</p>
<p>So part of the way I was trying to fund Numba,</p>
<p>say, well, let&rsquo;s do the free Numba</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll have a commercial version of Numba</p>
<p>called Numba Pro.</p>
<p>And what Numba Pro did is it targeted GPUs.</p>
<p>So we had the very first CUDA JIT</p>
<p>and the very first at JIT compiler that in 2012 for 13,</p>
<p>you could run not just a view func on CPU,</p>
<p>but a view func on GPUs.</p>
<p>And it would automatically paralyze it</p>
<p>and get 1000X speed on it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting funding mechanism</p>
<p>because large companies or larger companies</p>
<p>care about speed in just this way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exactly a really good way.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s been a couple of things</p>
<p>you know people will pay for.</p>
<p>One, they&rsquo;ll pay for really good user interfaces, right?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m always looking for what are the things</p>
<p>people will pay for that you could actually adapt</p>
<p>to the open source infrastructure?</p>
<p>One is definitely user interfaces.</p>
<p>The second is speed, like a better runtime, faster runtime.</p>
<p>And then when you say people,</p>
<p>you mean like a small number of people pay a lot of money,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also this other mechanism that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>A ton of people pay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>First, I gotta, we mentioned Anaconda,</p>
<p>we mentioned friends, family, and fools.</p>
<p>So Anaconda is yet another.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a company, but there&rsquo;s also a project.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That is exceptionally impactful in terms of,</p>
<p>for many reasons, but one of which is bringing</p>
<p>a lot more people into the community</p>
<p>of folks who use Python.</p>
<p>So what is Anaconda?</p>
<p>What is its goals?</p>
<p>Maybe what is Conda versus Anaconda?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll tell you a little bit of the history of that.</p>
<p>Cause Anaconda, we wanted to do,</p>
<p>we wanted to scale Python.</p>
<p>Cause we, you know, that was the goal.</p>
<p>Peter and I had the goal of when we started Anaconda,</p>
<p>we actually started as Continuum Analytics</p>
<p>was the name of the company that started.</p>
<p>It got renamed Anaconda in 2015.</p>
<p>But we said, we want to scale analytics.</p>
<p>NumPy is great, Pandas is emerging,</p>
<p>but these need to run at scale with lots of machines.</p>
<p>The other thing we wanted to do was make user interfaces</p>
<p>that were web.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure the web did not pass</p>
<p>by the Python community.</p>
<p>That we had ways to translate your data science to the web.</p>
<p>So those are the two kind of technical areas.</p>
<p>We thought, oh, we&rsquo;ll build products in this space.</p>
<p>And that was the idea.</p>
<p>Very quickly in, but of course,</p>
<p>the thing I knew how to do was to do consulting</p>
<p>to make money and to make sure my family and friends</p>
<p>and fools that had invested didn&rsquo;t lose their money.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little different</p>
<p>than if you take money from a venture fund.</p>
<p>If you take money from a venture fund,</p>
<p>the venture fund, they want you to go big or go home.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re kind of like expecting nine out of 10 to fail</p>
<p>or 99 out of 100 to fail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I was, I was owed a barbell strategy.</p>
<p>I was like, I can&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>I mean, I may not do super well,</p>
<p>but I cannot lose their money.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to do something I know can return a profit,</p>
<p>but I want to have exposure to an upside.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what happened at Anaconda.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, there was lots of things we did not well</p>
<p>in terms of that structure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned from since and how to do it better.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve, we did a really good job</p>
<p>of kind of attracting the interest around the area</p>
<p>to get good people working</p>
<p>and then get funnel some money</p>
<p>on some interesting projects.</p>
<p>Super excited about what came out of our energy there.</p>
<p>Like a lot did.</p>
<p>So what are some of the interesting projects?</p>
<p>So Dask, Numba, Bokeh, Conda.</p>
<p>There was a data shader, Panel, Holoviz.</p>
<p>These are all tools that are extremely relevant</p>
<p>in terms of helping you build applications,</p>
<p>build tools, build, you know, faster code.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple I&rsquo;m forgetting.</p>
<p>Oh, JupyterLab, JupyterLab came out of this too.</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so Bokeh does plotting?</p>
<p>Is that?</p>
<p>Bokeh does plotting.</p>
<p>So Bokeh was one of the foundational things to say,</p>
<p>I want to do plot in Python,</p>
<p>but have the things show up in a web.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And plotting to me still,</p>
<p>with all due respect to Matplotlib and Bokeh,</p>
<p>it feels like still an unsolved problem,</p>
<p>not a solved problem.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>Right, because you&rsquo;re, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s visualization broadly, right?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve got a pretty good API story</p>
<p>around certain use cases of plotting.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a difference between static plots</p>
<p>versus interactive plots versus I&rsquo;m an end user,</p>
<p>I just want to write a simple,</p>
<p>for Pandas started the idea of here&rsquo;s a data frame</p>
<p>on a dot plot, I&rsquo;m just going to attach plot</p>
<p>as a method to my object,</p>
<p>which was a little bit controversial, right?</p>
<p>But works pretty well, actually,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot less you have to pass in, right?</p>
<p>You can just say, here&rsquo;s my object, you know what you are,</p>
<p>you tell the visualization what to do.</p>
<p>So that, and there&rsquo;s things like that</p>
<p>that have not been super well developed entirely,</p>
<p>but Bokeh was focused on interactive plotting.</p>
<p>So you could, it&rsquo;s a short path</p>
<p>between interactive plotting and application,</p>
<p>dashboard application.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some incredible work that got done there, right?</p>
<p>And it was a hard project,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re basically doing JavaScript and Python.</p>
<p>So we wanted to tackle some of these hard problems</p>
<p>and try to just go after them.</p>
<p>We got some DARPA funding to help,</p>
<p>and it was super helpful, funny story there,</p>
<p>we actually did two DARPA proposals,</p>
<p>but one we were five minutes late for.</p>
<p>And DARPA has a very strict cutoff window.</p>
<p>And so I, we had two proposals,</p>
<p>one for the Bokeh and one for actually Numba</p>
<p>and the other work.</p>
<p>Which one were you late for?</p>
<p>The Foundation on Numerical Work.</p>
<p>So Bokeh got funded. Oh no.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Chris let us use some of the money to fund</p>
<p>still some of the other foundational work,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t as, yeah, his hands were tired,</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>That was a whole interesting story.</p>
<p>So one of the incredible projects</p>
<p>that you worked on is Conda.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what is Conda? So how that came about,</p>
<p>yeah, Conda, it was early on, like I said, with SciPy.</p>
<p>SciPy was a distribution mass generation library.</p>
<p>And he said, he heard me talking about compiler issues</p>
<p>and trying to get the stuff shipped</p>
<p>and the fact that people can use your libraries</p>
<p>if they have it.</p>
<p>So for a long time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d understood the packaging problem in Python.</p>
<p>And one of the first things he did at Conda Analytics</p>
<p>became Anaconda was organize the Pi data ecosystem</p>
<p>in conjunction with NumFocus.</p>
<p>We actually started NumFocus</p>
<p>with some other folks in the community</p>
<p>the same year we started Anaconda.</p>
<p>I said, we&rsquo;re gonna build a corporation,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also gonna reify the community aspect</p>
<p>and build a nonprofit.</p>
<p>So we did both of those.</p>
<p>Can we pause real quick and can you say what is PyPy,</p>
<p>the Python package index,</p>
<p>like this whole story of packaging in Python?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna get to actually.</p>
<p>This is exactly the journey I&rsquo;m on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to sort of explain packaging in Python.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s best expressed to the conversation</p>
<p>I had with Guido at a conference,</p>
<p>where I said, so packaging is kind of a problem.</p>
<p>And Guido said, I don&rsquo;t ever care about packaging.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t install new libraries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I guess if you&rsquo;re the language creator</p>
<p>and if you need something, you just put it in the distribution</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t worry about packaging.</p>
<p>But Guido has never really cared about packaging, right?</p>
<p>And never really cared about the problem of distribution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fair position to take, I think,</p>
<p>as a language creator.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a philosophical question about</p>
<p>should you have different development packaging managers?</p>
<p>Should you have a package manager per language?</p>
<p>Is that really the right approach?</p>
<p>I think there are some answers of</p>
<p>it is appropriate to have development tools.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an aspect of a development tool</p>
<p>that is related to packaging.</p>
<p>And every language should have some story there</p>
<p>to help their developers create.</p>
<p>So you should have language specific development tools.</p>
<p>Development tools that relate to package managers.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a very specific user story</p>
<p>around package management</p>
<p>that those language specific package managers</p>
<p>have to interact with.</p>
<p>And currently aren&rsquo;t doing a good job of that.</p>
<p>That was one of the challenges</p>
<p>that not seeing that difference,</p>
<p>and it still exists in the difference today.</p>
<p>Conda always was a user.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use Python to do data science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use Python to do something.</p>
<p>How do I get this installed?</p>
<p>It was always focused on that.</p>
<p>So it didn&rsquo;t have a develop.</p>
<p>Classic example is pip has a pip develop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I wanna install this</p>
<p>into my current development environment today.</p>
<p>Conda doesn&rsquo;t have that concept</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not part of the story.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>pip is a Python specific package manager.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exceptionally popular.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably like the default thing you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the default user.</p>
<p>And so the story there emerged</p>
<p>because what happened is in 2012,</p>
<p>we had this meeting at the Googleplex</p>
<p>and Guido was there to come talk about what we&rsquo;re gonna do,</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re gonna make things work better.</p>
<p>And Wes McKinney, me, Peter,</p>
<p>Peter has a great photo of me talking to Guido</p>
<p>and he pretends we&rsquo;re talking about this story.</p>
<p>Maybe we were, maybe we weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But we did at that meeting talk about it</p>
<p>and asked Guido, we need to fix packaging in Python.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t get the stuff.</p>
<p>And he said, go fix it yourself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The origin story right there.</p>
<p>All right, you said, okay, you said to do this ourselves.</p>
<p>So at the same time,</p>
<p>people did start to work on the packaging story in Python.</p>
<p>It just took a little longer.</p>
<p>So in 2012, kind of motivated</p>
<p>by our training courses we were teaching,</p>
<p>like very similar to what you just mentioned</p>
<p>about your mother.</p>
<p>Like it was motivated by the same purpose.</p>
<p>Like how do we get this into people&rsquo;s hands?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this big, long process.</p>
<p>It takes too expensive.</p>
<p>It was actually hurting NumPy development</p>
<p>because I would hear people were saying,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make that change to NumPy</p>
<p>because I just spent a week getting my Python environment.</p>
<p>And if you change NumPy, I have to reinstall everything.</p>
<p>And reinstalling is such a pain, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wait, okay.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re not making changes to a library</p>
<p>because of the installation problem</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll cause for end users.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a problem with installation.</p>
<p>We gotta fix this.</p>
<p>So we said, we&rsquo;re gonna make a distribution in Python.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d previously done that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d previously done that at mthought.</p>
<p>I wanted to make one that would give away for free,</p>
<p>that everyone could just get.</p>
<p>Like that was critical that we could just get it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t tied to a product.</p>
<p>It was just you could get it.</p>
<p>And then we had constantly thought about,</p>
<p>well, do we just leverage RPM?</p>
<p>But the challenge had always been,</p>
<p>we want a package manager that works on Windows,</p>
<p>Mac OS X, and Linux the same, right?</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have anything like that.</p>
<p>You have&hellip;</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>RPM is an operating system specific package manager.</p>
<p>Correct, it&rsquo;s an operating specific.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So do you create the design questions,</p>
<p>do you create an umbrella package manager</p>
<p>that works across operating systems?</p>
<p>Yes, that was the decision.</p>
<p>And in neighboring design questions,</p>
<p>do you also create a package manager</p>
<p>that spans multiple programming languages?</p>
<p>Correct, exactly.</p>
<p>That was the world we faced.</p>
<p>And we decided to go multiple operating systems,</p>
<p>multiple and programming language independent.</p>
<p>Because even Python, and particularly what was important</p>
<p>was SciPy has a bunch of Fortran in it, right?</p>
<p>And scikit learn has links to a bunch of C++.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of compiled code.</p>
<p>And the Python package managers, especially early on,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even support that.</p>
<p>So in 2000, so we released Anaconda,</p>
<p>which was just a distribution of libraries,</p>
<p>but we started to work on Conda in 2012.</p>
<p>First version of Conda came out in early 2013,</p>
<p>summer of 2013, and it was a package manager.</p>
<p>So you could say, Conda install scikit learn.</p>
<p>In fact, scikit learn was a fantastic project that emerged.</p>
<p>It was the classic example of the scikits.</p>
<p>I talked to you earlier about SciPy being too big</p>
<p>to be a single library.</p>
<p>Well, what the community had done is said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make scikits.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s scikit image, there&rsquo;s scikit learn,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of scikits.</p>
<p>And it was a fantastic move that the community did.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the name.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the fact you typed scikit image.</p>
<p>I was like, that&rsquo;s gotta be simpler.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s scikit learn, we gotta make that smaller.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like typing all this stuff from imports.</p>
<p>So I was kind of a pressure that way,</p>
<p>but I love the energy and love the fact</p>
<p>that they went out and they did it,</p>
<p>and DOS people, Jared Millman, and then of course, Gael,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s people I&rsquo;m not even naming.</p>
<p>Scikit learn really emerged as a fantastic project.</p>
<p>And the documentation around that is also incredible.</p>
<p>And the documentation was incredible, exactly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who did that, but they did a great job.</p>
<p>A lot of people in Inria, a lot of European contributors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some Andreas in the US.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of just people I just adore,</p>
<p>I think are amazing people.</p>
<p>Awesome use of SciPy, right?</p>
<p>I love the fact that they were using SciPy effectively</p>
<p>to do something I love, which is machine learning,</p>
<p>but couldn&rsquo;t install it.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so many pieces involved.</p>
<p>So many dependencies, right?</p>
<p>So our use case of Conda was Conda install scikit learn.</p>
<p>Right, and it was the best way to install scikit learn</p>
<p>in 2013 to really 2018, 17, 18, PIP finally caught up.</p>
<p>I still think it&rsquo;s you should Conda install scikit learn</p>
<p>for the PIP install scikit learn,</p>
<p>but you can PIP install scikit learn.</p>
<p>The issue is the package they created was wheels</p>
<p>and PIP does not handle the multi vendor approach.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t handle the fact you have C++ libraries</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re depending on.</p>
<p>They just stop at the Python boundary.</p>
<p>And so what you have to do in the wheel world</p>
<p>is you have to vendor.</p>
<p>You have to take all of the binary and vendor it.</p>
<p>Now, if your change happens in underlying dependency,</p>
<p>you have to redo the whole wheel.</p>
<p>So TensorFlow, as you know,</p>
<p>you should not PIP install TensorFlow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>People do it because the popularity of PIP,</p>
<p>many people think, oh, of course,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I install everything in Python.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of the big challenges.</p>
<p>You take a GitHub repository or just a basic blog post.</p>
<p>The number of time PIP is mentioned over Conda</p>
<p>is like 100 X to one.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>So it just has to do with the.</p>
<p>And that was increasing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t true early because PIP didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Like Conda came first.</p>
<p>So but that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Like Conda came first, but that&rsquo;s like the long tail</p>
<p>of the internet documentation user generated.</p>
<p>So that like you think, how do I install Google?</p>
<p>How do I install TensorFlow?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not gonna see Conda in that first page.</p>
<p>Correct, exactly.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>Not today, you would have in 2016, 2017.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad because Conda solves</p>
<p>a lot of usability issues.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Like for especially super challenging thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>One of the big pain points for me was</p>
<p>just on the computer vision side, OpenCV installation.</p>
<p>Perfect example.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think Conda, I don&rsquo;t know if Conda solved that one.</p>
<p>Conda has an OpenCV package.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I certainly know PIP has not solved.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s complexities there because.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I should probably know a good answer for this,</p>
<p>but if you compile OpenCV with certain dependencies,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to do certain things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of flexibility of what you,</p>
<p>like what options you compile with.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s trivial to do that with Conda or.</p>
<p>So Conda has a notion of variance of a package.</p>
<p>You can actually have different compilation versions</p>
<p>of a package.</p>
<p>So not just the version is different,</p>
<p>but oh, this is compiled with these optimizations on.</p>
<p>So Conda does have an answer.</p>
<p>Has those flavors.</p>
<p>Has flavors, basically.</p>
<p>Well, PIP, as far as I know, does not have flavors.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>PIP generally hasn&rsquo;t thought deeply</p>
<p>about the binary dependency problem, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why fundamentally it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>for the SciPy ecosystem.</p>
<p>It barely, you can sort of paper over it and duct tape</p>
<p>and it kind of works until it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and it falls apart entirely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Like, and I&rsquo;ve been having lots of conversations</p>
<p>with people over the years because again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an area where if you understand some things,</p>
<p>but not all the things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve done a great job of community appeal.</p>
<p>This is an area where I think Anaconda as a company</p>
<p>needed to do some things</p>
<p>in order to make Conda more community centric, right?</p>
<p>And this is a, I talk about this all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a balance between you have every project starts</p>
<p>with what I called company backed open source.</p>
<p>Even if the company is yourself, it&rsquo;s just one person,</p>
<p>just doing business as.</p>
<p>But ultimately for products to succeed virally</p>
<p>and become massive influencers,</p>
<p>they have to create,</p>
<p>they have to get community people on board.</p>
<p>They have to get other people on board.</p>
<p>So it has to become community driven.</p>
<p>And a big part of that is engagement with those people.</p>
<p>Empowering people, governance around it.</p>
<p>And what happened with Conda in the early days,</p>
<p>PIP emerged and we did do some good things.</p>
<p>Conda Forge, Conda Forge community</p>
<p>is sort of the community recipe creation community.</p>
<p>But Conda itself, I still believe,</p>
<p>and Peter is CEO of Anaconda, he&rsquo;s my co founder.</p>
<p>I ran Anaconda until 2017, 2018.</p>
<p>Is Peter still Anaconda?</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s still Anaconda, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still great friends.</p>
<p>We talk all the time.</p>
<p>I love him to death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long story there about like why and how</p>
<p>and we can cover in some other podcast perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a more, maybe a more business focused one.</p>
<p>But this is one area where I think Conda</p>
<p>should be more community driven.</p>
<p>Like he should be pushing more</p>
<p>to get more community contributors to Conda</p>
<p>and let the, Anaconda shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting this battle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s really a developers.</p>
<p>Like you said, like help the developers</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll actually move us the right direction.</p>
<p>Well, that was the problem I have is many</p>
<p>of the cool kids I know don&rsquo;t use Conda.</p>
<p>And that to me is confusing.</p>
<p>It is confusing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a matter of, Conda has some challenges.</p>
<p>First of all, Conda still needs to be improved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of improvements to be made.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that aspect of wait, who&rsquo;s doing this?</p>
<p>And the fact that then the Pi PA really stepped up.</p>
<p>Like they were not solving the problem at all.</p>
<p>And now they kind of got to where they&rsquo;re solving it</p>
<p>for the most part.</p>
<p>And then effectively you could get,</p>
<p>like Conda solved a problem that was there.</p>
<p>And it still does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still, you know, there&rsquo;s still great things it can do.</p>
<p>But, and we still use it all the time at one site</p>
<p>and with other clients, but with,</p>
<p>but you can kind of do similar things with PIP and Docker.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So especially with the web development community,</p>
<p>that part of it, again, is this is the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different kinds of developers</p>
<p>in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still a lack of some clear understanding.</p>
<p>I go to the Python conference all the time</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s only a few people in the Pi PA who get it.</p>
<p>And then others who are just massively trumpeting</p>
<p>the power of PIP, but just do not understand the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So one of the obvious things to me from a mom,</p>
<p>from a non programmer perspective,</p>
<p>is the across operating system usability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much more natural.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s people that use Windows and just,</p>
<p>it seems much easier to recommend Conda there,</p>
<p>but then it, you should also recommend it across the board.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll definitely sort of.</p>
<p>But what I recommend now is a hybrid.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I mean, I have no problem.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use?</p>
<p>Oh, it is.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>But like build the environment with PIP, with Conda,</p>
<p>build an environment with Conda</p>
<p>and then PIP install on top of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Be careful about PIP installing OpenCV or TensorFlow</p>
<p>or because if somebody&rsquo;s allowed that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be most surely done in a way</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be updated that easily.</p>
<p>So install like the big packages,</p>
<p>the infrastructure with Conda and then the weirdos.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That like the weird like implementation for some.</p>
<p>I had a, there&rsquo;s a cool library I used</p>
<p>that based on your location and time of day and date</p>
<p>tells you the exact position of the sun</p>
<p>relative to the earth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like a simple library,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very precise.</p>
<p>And I was like, all right.</p>
<p>But that was, that was, and it&rsquo;s like PIP.</p>
<p>Well, the thing they did really well is Python developers</p>
<p>who wanna get their stuff published,</p>
<p>you have to have a PIP recipe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, even if it&rsquo;s, you know, the challenge is,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a key thing that needs to be added to PIP,</p>
<p>just simply add to PIP the ability to defer</p>
<p>to a system package manager.</p>
<p>Like, cause it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>recognize you&rsquo;re not gonna solve all the dependency problem.</p>
<p>So let like give up and allow the system package to work.</p>
<p>That way Anaconda is installed and it has PIP.</p>
<p>It would default to Conda to install stuff,</p>
<p>but Red Hat RPM would default to RPM</p>
<p>to install some more things.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s a key, not difficult,</p>
<p>but somewhat work, some work feature needs to be added.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of something like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known we need to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s where I wish I had more money.</p>
<p>I wish I was more successful in the business side,</p>
<p>trying to get there, but I wish my, you know,</p>
<p>my family, friends and full community that I know.</p>
<p>Was larger.</p>
<p>Was larger and had more money.</p>
<p>Cause I know tons of things to do effectively</p>
<p>with more resources, but you know,</p>
<p>I have not yet been successful at channel.</p>
<p>Tons of, you know, some, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with what we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>We created again at Quansight,</p>
<p>what we created to get Anaconda started.</p>
<p>We created community to get Anaconda started.</p>
<p>Done it again with Quansight.</p>
<p>Super excited by that.</p>
<p>But it took three years to do it.</p>
<p>What is Quansight?</p>
<p>What is its mission?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a few times about different fascinating</p>
<p>aspects of it, but let&rsquo;s like big picture,</p>
<p>what is Quansight?</p>
<p>Big picture Quansight.</p>
<p>Quansight is, its mission is to connect data</p>
<p>to an open economy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically consulting of the pie data ecosystem,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a consulting company.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve said when I started it was we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to create products, people, and technology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s divided into two groups.</p>
<p>And a third one as well.</p>
<p>The two groups are a consulting services company</p>
<p>that just helps people do data science</p>
<p>and data engineering and data management better</p>
<p>and more efficiently.</p>
<p>Like full stack, like full thing.</p>
<p>Full stack data science, full thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll help you build a infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Jupiter, we need,</p>
<p>we do staff augmentation, need more pro programmers,</p>
<p>help you use Dask more effectively,</p>
<p>help you use GPUs more effectively.</p>
<p>Just basically a lot of people need help.</p>
<p>So we do training as well to help people, you know,</p>
<p>both immediate help and then get, learn from somebody.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added a bunch of stuff too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve kind of separated some of these other things</p>
<p>into another company called Open Teams</p>
<p>that we currently started.</p>
<p>One of the things I loved about what we did at Anaconda</p>
<p>was creating a community innovation team.</p>
<p>And so I wanted to replicate that.</p>
<p>This time we did a lot of innovation at Anaconda.</p>
<p>I wanted to do innovation,</p>
<p>but also contribute to the projects that existed,</p>
<p>like create a place where maintainers,</p>
<p>so the SciPy and NumPy and Numba</p>
<p>and all these projects we already started</p>
<p>can pay people to work on them and keep them going.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Labs.</p>
<p>Quansight Labs is a separate organization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nonprofit mission.</p>
<p>The profits of Quansight help fund it.</p>
<p>And in fact, every project that we have at Quansight,</p>
<p>a portion of the money goes directly to Quansight Labs</p>
<p>to help keep it funded.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve gotten several mechanisms</p>
<p>that we keep Quansight Labs funded.</p>
<p>And currently, so I&rsquo;m really excited about Labs</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been a mission for a long time.</p>
<p>What kind of projects are within Labs?</p>
<p>So Labs is working to make the software better,</p>
<p>like make NumPy better, make SciPy better.</p>
<p>It only works on open source.</p>
<p>So if somebody wants to, so companies do,</p>
<p>we have a thing called a community work order, we call it.</p>
<p>If a company says, I wanna make Spyder better.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>You can pay for a month of a developer of Spyder</p>
<p>or a developer of NumPy or a developer of SciPy.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell them what you want them to do.</p>
<p>You can give them your priorities and things you wish existed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll work on those priorities with the community</p>
<p>to get what the community wants</p>
<p>and what emerges of what the community wants.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect on the consulting side</p>
<p>that is helping, as we were talking about morphology</p>
<p>and so on, is there specific application</p>
<p>that are particularly like driving,</p>
<p>sort of inspiring the need for updates to SciPy?</p>
<p>Correct, absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>GPUs are absolutely one of them.</p>
<p>And new hardware beyond GPUs.</p>
<p>I mean, Tesla&rsquo;s Dojo chip, I&rsquo;m hoping we&rsquo;ll have a chance</p>
<p>to work on that perhaps.</p>
<p>Things like that are definitely driving it.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s driving it is scalable,</p>
<p>like speed and scale.</p>
<p>How do I write NumPy code or NumPy Lite code</p>
<p>if I want it to run across a cluster?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Dask or maybe it&rsquo;s Ray.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s sort of ways to do that now.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s Moden and there&rsquo;s, so Pandas code,</p>
<p>NumPy code, SciPy code, Scikit learn code</p>
<p>that I want to scale.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one big area.</p>
<p>Have you gotten a chance to chat with Andre and Elon</p>
<p>about particular, because like.</p>
<p>No, I would love to, by the way.</p>
<p>I have not, but I&rsquo;d love to.</p>
<p>I just saw their Tesla AI Days video.</p>
<p>Super excited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the, you know, I love great engineering,</p>
<p>software engineering teams and engineering teams in general.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing a lot of incredible stuff with Python.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like revolutionary.</p>
<p>So many aspects of the machine learning pipeline.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s operating in the real world.</p>
<p>And so much of that is Python.</p>
<p>Like you said, the guy running, you know, Andre Kapathy,</p>
<p>running Autopilot is tweeting about optimization</p>
<p>of NumPy versus.</p>
<p>I would love to talk to him.</p>
<p>In fact, we have at Quonset, we&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to work with Facebook on PyTorch directly.</p>
<p>So we have about 13 developers at Quonset.</p>
<p>Some of them are in labs working directly on PyTorch.</p>
<p>On PyTorch.</p>
<p>On PyTorch, right.</p>
<p>So I basically started Quonset.</p>
<p>I went to both TensorFlow and PyTorch and said,</p>
<p>hey, I want to help connect what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to the broader SciPy ecosystem.</p>
<p>Because I see what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We have this bigger mission that we want to make sure</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t, you know, lose energy here.</p>
<p>So, and Facebook responded really positively</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t get the same reaction.</p>
<p>Not yet, not yet.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>So I really love the folks at TensorFlow, too.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fantastic.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the, just how it integrates</p>
<p>with their business.</p>
<p>I mean, like I said, there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>Just the timing, the integration with their business,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably looking for more users.</p>
<p>And I was looking to kind of cut up some development effort</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t receive that as easily, I think.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping, I&rsquo;m really hopeful</p>
<p>and love the people there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea behind OpenTeams?</p>
<p>So OpenTeams, I&rsquo;m super excited about OpenTeams</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of the,</p>
<p>I mentioned my idea for investing directly in open source.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a concept called fair OSS.</p>
<p>But one of the things we, when we started Quansight,</p>
<p>we knew we would do is we develop products and ideas</p>
<p>and new companies might come out.</p>
<p>At Anaconda, this was clear, right?</p>
<p>Anaconda, we did so much innovation</p>
<p>that like five or six companies could have come out of that.</p>
<p>And we just didn&rsquo;t structure it so they could.</p>
<p>But in fact, they have, you look at Dask,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two companies going out of Dask.</p>
<p>You know, Bokeh could be a company.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like lots of companies that could exist</p>
<p>off the work we did there.</p>
<p>And so I thought, oh, here&rsquo;s a recipe for an incubation,</p>
<p>a concept that we could actually spawn new companies</p>
<p>and new innovations.</p>
<p>And then the idea has always been,</p>
<p>well, money they earn should come back</p>
<p>to fund the open source projects.</p>
<p>So labs is, you know, I think there should be</p>
<p>a lot of things like Quansight Labs.</p>
<p>I think this concept is one that scales.</p>
<p>You could have a lot of open source research labs.</p>
<p>Along the way, so in 2018, when the bigger idea came,</p>
<p>how to make open source investable, I said,</p>
<p>oh, I need to write, I need to create a venture fund.</p>
<p>So we created a venture fund called Quansight Initiate</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an angel fund, really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, we started to learn that process.</p>
<p>How do we actually do this?</p>
<p>How do we get LPs?</p>
<p>How do we actually go in this direction and build a fund?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, every venture fund should have</p>
<p>an associated open source research lab,</p>
<p>which is no reason.</p>
<p>Like our venture fund, the carried interest,</p>
<p>a portion of it goes to the lab.</p>
<p>It directly will fund the lab.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, brother.</p>
<p>So you use the power of the organic formation of teams</p>
<p>in the open source community, and then like naturally,</p>
<p>that leads to a business that can make money.</p>
<p>Yeah, correct.</p>
<p>And then it always maintains and loops back</p>
<p>to the open source.</p>
<p>Loops back to open source, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, it&rsquo;s a natural fit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, there&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>a repeatable pattern there, and it&rsquo;s also beneficial</p>
<p>because, oh, I have, I have natural connections</p>
<p>to the open source if I have an open source research lab.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;ll always, they&rsquo;ll be out there</p>
<p>talking to people, and so we&rsquo;ve had a chance</p>
<p>to talk to a lot of early stage companies.</p>
<p>And we, and our fund focuses on the early stage.</p>
<p>So Quansight has the services, the lab, the fund, right?</p>
<p>In that process, a lot of stuff started to happen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, you know, we started to do recruiting</p>
<p>and support and training, and I was starting</p>
<p>to build a bigger sales team and marketing team</p>
<p>and people besides just developers.</p>
<p>And one of the challenges with that</p>
<p>is you end up with different cultural aspects.</p>
<p>You know, developers, you know, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>in any company you go to, you kind of go look,</p>
<p>is this a business led company, a developer led company?</p>
<p>Do they kind of coexist?</p>
<p>Are they, what&rsquo;s the interface between them?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a bit of a tension there.</p>
<p>Like we were talking about before.</p>
<p>You know, what is the tension there?</p>
<p>With OpenTeams, I thought, wait a minute,</p>
<p>we can actually just create,</p>
<p>like this concept of Quansight plus labs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, well, it&rsquo;s specific to the Pi data ecosystem.</p>
<p>The concept is general for all open source.</p>
<p>So OpenTeams emerged as a, oh,</p>
<p>we can create a business development company</p>
<p>for many, many Quansights, like thousands of Quansights.</p>
<p>And it can be a marketplace to connect,</p>
<p>essentially be the enterprise software company</p>
<p>of the future.</p>
<p>If you look at what enterprise software wants</p>
<p>from the customer side, and during this journey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the chance to work and sell to lots of companies,</p>
<p>Exxon and Shell and Davey Morgan Bank of America,</p>
<p>like the Fortune 100,</p>
<p>and talk to a lot of people in procurement</p>
<p>and see what are they buying and why are they buying?</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know everything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about,</p>
<p>oh, what are they really looking for?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re looking for solutions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly given products</p>
<p>from enterprise software.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s open source, leave the enterprise software,</p>
<p>now I buy it.</p>
<p>And then they have to stitch it together into a solution.</p>
<p>Open source is fantastic for gluing</p>
<p>those solutions together.</p>
<p>So, whereas they keep getting new platforms</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to buy,</p>
<p>but most open source, what most enterprises want</p>
<p>is tools that they can customize</p>
<p>that are as inexpensive as they can.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so you always want to maintain</p>
<p>the connection to the open source</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to be the tools.</p>
<p>Yes, so open teams is about solving</p>
<p>enterprise software problems.</p>
<p>Brilliant, brilliant idea, by the way.</p>
<p>With a connect, but we do it honoring the topology.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t hire all the people.</p>
<p>We are a network connecting the sales energy</p>
<p>and the procurement energy,</p>
<p>and we work on the business side,</p>
<p>get the deals closed,</p>
<p>and then have a network of partners</p>
<p>like Quonsight and others who we hand the deals to,</p>
<p>to actually do the work.</p>
<p>And then we have to maintain,</p>
<p>I feel like we have to maintain</p>
<p>some level of quality control</p>
<p>so that the client can rely on open teams</p>
<p>to ensure the delivery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, here&rsquo;s a lead, go figure that out.</p>
<p>But no, we&rsquo;re going to make sure you get what you need.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s such a skill,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if I have the patience.</p>
<p>I will have the patience to talk to the business people</p>
<p>or more specific, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of flavors of business people</p>
<p>or like marketing people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>I hear what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve had the same challenge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sometimes you think, okay, this is way overwrought.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you have to become an adult</p>
<p>and you have to, because the companies have needs.</p>
<p>They have ways to make money</p>
<p>and they also want to learn and grow,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s your job to kind of educate them on the best way,</p>
<p>like the value of open source, for example.</p>
<p>Right, and I&rsquo;m really grateful for all my experiences</p>
<p>over the past 14 years, understanding that side of it</p>
<p>and still learning for sure,</p>
<p>but not just understanding from companies,</p>
<p>but also dealing with marketing professionals</p>
<p>and sales professionals</p>
<p>and people that make a career out of that</p>
<p>and understanding what they&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>and also understanding, well, let&rsquo;s make this better.</p>
<p>We can really make a place.</p>
<p>Open teams I see as the transmission layer</p>
<p>between companies and open source communities</p>
<p>producing enterprise software solutions.</p>
<p>Eventually we want to,</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re taking on SaaS and MATLAB</p>
<p>and tools that we know we can replace for folks.</p>
<p>Really, anytime you have a software tool at an organization</p>
<p>where you have to do a lot of customization</p>
<p>to make it work for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re just buying this thing off the shelf</p>
<p>and it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, you buy this system</p>
<p>and then you customize it a lot,</p>
<p>usually with expensive consultants</p>
<p>to actually make it work for you.</p>
<p>All of those should be replaced by open source foundations</p>
<p>with the same customization.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing such important work,</p>
<p>such important work in these giant organizations</p>
<p>that do exactly that,</p>
<p>taking some proprietary software</p>
<p>and hiring a huge team of consultants</p>
<p>that customize it and then that whole thing</p>
<p>gets outdated quick.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So the one solution to that</p>
<p>is kind of what Tesla&rsquo;s doing a little bit of,</p>
<p>which is basically build up a software engineering team.</p>
<p>Like build a team from scratch.</p>
<p>Build a team from scratch.</p>
<p>And companies are doing it well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re creating a topology for some of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the only answer, right?</p>
<p>And so other companies can access this,</p>
<p>be more accessible.</p>
<p>We literally say,</p>
<p>open team is the future of enterprise software.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still early.</p>
<p>Like this idea just percolated over the past year</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve kind of grown Quansight</p>
<p>and realized the extensibility of it.</p>
<p>We just finished in our seed round</p>
<p>to help get more sales people</p>
<p>and then push the messaging correctly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of tools we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>to make this easier.</p>
<p>Like we wanna automate the processes.</p>
<p>We feel like a lot of the power</p>
<p>is the efficiency of the sales process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of wasted energy in small teams</p>
<p>and the sales energy to get into large companies</p>
<p>and make a deal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of money spent on that process.</p>
<p>Creating the tools and processes for that sales.</p>
<p>So make that super seamless.</p>
<p>So a single company can go,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;ve got my contract with open teams.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a subscription they can get.</p>
<p>They can make that procurement seamless.</p>
<p>And then the fact they have access</p>
<p>to the entire open source ecosystem.</p>
<p>And we have a part of our work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s embracing open source ecosystems</p>
<p>and making sure we&rsquo;re doing things useful for them</p>
<p>or serving them.</p>
<p>And then companies making sure</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting solutions they care about.</p>
<p>And then figuring out which targets we have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not taking on all of open source,</p>
<p>all of enterprise software yet.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re step by step.</p>
<p>Well this feels like the future.</p>
<p>The idea and the vision is brilliant.</p>
<p>Can I ask you, why do you think Microsoft bought GitHub</p>
<p>and what do you think is the future of GitHub?</p>
<p>Great point.</p>
<p>I thought it was a brilliant move.</p>
<p>I think they did because Microsoft has always</p>
<p>had a developer centric culture.</p>
<p>Like they always have.</p>
<p>Like one of the things Microsoft&rsquo;s always done well</p>
<p>is understand that their power is the developers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been, Ballmer didn&rsquo;t necessarily make a good meme</p>
<p>about how he approached that.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re broadening that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Because they recognize GitHub is where developers are at.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>But do they have a vision like open teams</p>
<p>type of situation, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so yet.</p>
<p>Are they just basically throwing money at developers</p>
<p>to show their support?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Without a topology like you put it.</p>
<p>Like a way to leverage that.</p>
<p>Like to give developers actual money.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still, it&rsquo;s an enterprise software company.</p>
<p>And they make a bunch of money.</p>
<p>They make a bunch of games.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a big company.</p>
<p>They sell products.</p>
<p>I think part of it is they know there&rsquo;s opportunity</p>
<p>to make money from GitHub.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a business there.</p>
<p>You know, to sell to developers.</p>
<p>Or to sell to people using development.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s part of that.</p>
<p>I think part of it is also there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they had definitely wanted to recognize</p>
<p>that you need to value open source</p>
<p>to get great developers.</p>
<p>Which is an important concept that was emerging</p>
<p>over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>That, you know, pay at Pi Data.</p>
<p>We were able to convince J.P. Morgan</p>
<p>to support Pi Data because of that fact.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That was where the money for them putting</p>
<p>a couple hundred thousand into supporting Pi Data</p>
<p>for several conferences was they want developers.</p>
<p>And they realized that developers want</p>
<p>to participate in open source.</p>
<p>So enterprise software folks don&rsquo;t always understand</p>
<p>how their software gets used.</p>
<p>Having spent a lot of time on the floors</p>
<p>at J.P. Morgan, at InShell, at ExxonMobil,</p>
<p>you see, oh, these companies have large development teams.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re kind of dealing with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s being delivered to them.</p>
<p>So I really feel kind of a privilege</p>
<p>that I had a chance to learn some of these people</p>
<p>and see what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And even work alongside them, you know,</p>
<p>as a consultant, using open source and trying to figure,</p>
<p>how do we make this work inside of our large organization?</p>
<p>Some of it is actually, for a large organization,</p>
<p>some of it is messaging to the world</p>
<p>that you care about developers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the cool, you care.</p>
<p>Like, for example, like if Ford,</p>
<p>cause I talked to them, like car companies, right?</p>
<p>They want to attract, you know,</p>
<p>you want to take on Tesla and autopilot.</p>
<p>You want to take on, right?</p>
<p>And so what do you do there?</p>
<p>You show that you&rsquo;re cool.</p>
<p>Like you try to show off that you care about developers</p>
<p>and they have a lot of trouble doing that.</p>
<p>And like one way, I think like Ford should have bought GitHub.</p>
<p>They just to show off, like these old school companies</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in a lot of different industries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably different ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably an art show that you care to developers.</p>
<p>And the developers, it&rsquo;s exactly what you, like,</p>
<p>for example, just spit balling here,</p>
<p>but like Ford or somebody like that</p>
<p>could give a hundred million dollars</p>
<p>to the development of NumPy.</p>
<p>And like literally look at like the top most popular projects</p>
<p>in Python and just say, we&rsquo;re just going to give money.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s going to immediately make you cool.</p>
<p>They could actually, yeah.</p>
<p>And in fact, they set up NumFocus to make it easy.</p>
<p>But the challenge was,</p>
<p>is also you have to have some business development.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a bit of a seeding problem, right?</p>
<p>And you look at how,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to the folks at Linux Foundation,</p>
<p>know how they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>I know how, and starting NumFocus,</p>
<p>because we had two babies in 2012.</p>
<p>One was Anaconda, one was NumFocus, right?</p>
<p>And they were both important efforts.</p>
<p>They had distinct journeys</p>
<p>and super grateful that both existed</p>
<p>and still grateful both exist.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s different energies in getting donations</p>
<p>as there is getting, this is important to my business.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m selling you something that this is a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make money this way.</p>
<p>Like if you can tie it,</p>
<p>if you can tie the message to an ROI for the company,</p>
<p>it becomes a brainer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more effective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more effective, right?</p>
<p>So, and there are rational arguments to make.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to have conversations with marketing,</p>
<p>especially marketing departments.</p>
<p>Like very early on, it was clear to me that,</p>
<p>oh, you could just take a fraction of your marketing budget</p>
<p>and just spend it on open source development.</p>
<p>And you get better results from your marketing.</p>
<p>Like, because.</p>
<p>How did those, can I, sorry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try not to go and rants here.</p>
<p>What have you learned from the interaction</p>
<p>with the marketing folks on that kind of,</p>
<p>because you gave a great example</p>
<p>of something that will obviously be much better investment</p>
<p>in terms of marketing is supporting open source projects.</p>
<p>The challenge is not dissimilar</p>
<p>from the challenge you have in academia</p>
<p>or the different colleges, right?</p>
<p>Knowledge gets very specific and very channeled, right?</p>
<p>And so people get,</p>
<p>they get a lot of learning in the thing they know about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard then to bridge that</p>
<p>and to get them to think differently enough</p>
<p>to have a sense that you might have something to offer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, how do I implement that?</p>
<p>How do I, what do I do with that?</p>
<p>Like, do I, which budget do I take from?</p>
<p>Do I slow down my spend on Google ads</p>
<p>or my spend on Facebook ads?</p>
<p>Or do I not hire a content creator and say like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an operational aspect to that,</p>
<p>that you have to be the CMO, right?</p>
<p>Or the CEO, you have to get the right level.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll have to hire at a high position level</p>
<p>where they care about this and this.</p>
<p>Right, or they won&rsquo;t know how, right?</p>
<p>And because you can also do it very clumsily, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen it, cause you can,</p>
<p>you absolutely have to honor and recognize</p>
<p>the people you&rsquo;re going to and the fact</p>
<p>that if you just throw money at them,</p>
<p>it could actually create more problems.</p>
<p>Can I just say, this is not you saying, can I just,</p>
<p>cause I just need, I need to say this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very surprised how often marketing people</p>
<p>are terrible at marketing.</p>
<p>I feel like the best marketing is doing something novel</p>
<p>and unique that anticipates the future.</p>
<p>It feels like so much of the marketing practice</p>
<p>is like what they took in school,</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re studying for what was the best thing</p>
<p>that was done in the past decade,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just repeating that over and over,</p>
<p>as opposed to innovating, like taking the risk.</p>
<p>To me, marketing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>Is taking the big risk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>And being the first one to risk.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an aspect of data observation</p>
<p>from that risk, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, shared what they&rsquo;re doing already.</p>
<p>But it absolutely, it&rsquo;s about, I think it&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this whole world on content marketing</p>
<p>that you could almost say, well, yeah, it can get over,</p>
<p>you can get inundated with stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not relevant to you.</p>
<p>Whereas what you&rsquo;re saying would be highly relevant</p>
<p>and highly useful and highly beneficial.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s risk.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why I sort of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of innovative ways of doing that.</p>
<p>Tesla&rsquo;s an example of people</p>
<p>that basically don&rsquo;t do marketing.</p>
<p>They do marketing in a very, like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say Elon hired a person who&rsquo;s just good at Twitter</p>
<p>for running Tesla&rsquo;s Twitter account.</p>
<p>No, right, right.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s exactly what you wanna be doing.</p>
<p>You want it to be constantly innovating in the.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s an aspect of telling.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve definitely seen people doing great work</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not talking about it.</p>
<p>Like, I would say that&rsquo;s actually a problem</p>
<p>I have right now with Quonset Labs.</p>
<p>Quonset Labs has been doing amazing work,</p>
<p>really excited about it,</p>
<p>but we have not been talking about it enough.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t been.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different ways to talk about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different ways to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different channels to which to communicate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, like, I&rsquo;ll just throw some shade</p>
<p>at companies I love.</p>
<p>So for example, iRobot,</p>
<p>I just had a conversation with them.</p>
<p>They make Roombas.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And I think I love, they&rsquo;re incredible robots,</p>
<p>but like every time they do like advertisement,</p>
<p>not advertisement, but like marketing type stuff,</p>
<p>it just looks so corporate.</p>
<p>And to me, the incredible,</p>
<p>maybe wrong in the case of iRobot, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But to me, when you&rsquo;re talking about engineering systems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really nice to show off the magic of the engineering</p>
<p>and the software and all the geniuses behind this product</p>
<p>and the tinkering and like the raw authenticity</p>
<p>of what it takes to build that system</p>
<p>versus the marketing people who want to have like</p>
<p>pretty people, like standing there all pretty</p>
<p>with the robots, like moving perfectly.</p>
<p>So to me, there&rsquo;s some aspect,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like speaking to the hackers,</p>
<p>you have to throw some bones,</p>
<p>some care towards the engineers, the developers,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some aspect, one, for the hiring,</p>
<p>but two, there&rsquo;s an authenticity to that,</p>
<p>authenticity to that kind of communication</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really inspiring to the end user as well.</p>
<p>Like if they know that brilliant people,</p>
<p>the best in the world are working at your company,</p>
<p>they start to believe that that product</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re creating is really good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, because your initial reaction would be,</p>
<p>wait, there&rsquo;s different users here.</p>
<p>Why would you do that to, you know,</p>
<p>my wife bought a Roomba, and she loves developers,</p>
<p>she loves me, but she doesn&rsquo;t care about that culture.</p>
<p>So essentially what you said is actually the authenticity,</p>
<p>because everyone has a friend, everyone knows people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s word of mouth, I mean, if you.</p>
<p>Word of mouth is so, so proper.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s the lack of that realization,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this halo effect that influences</p>
<p>your general marketing, interesting.</p>
<p>For some stupid reason, I do have a platform,</p>
<p>and it seems that the reason I have a platform,</p>
<p>many others like me, millions of others,</p>
<p>is like the authenticity,</p>
<p>and like we get excited naturally about stuff.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t want to get excited</p>
<p>about that iRobot video,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s boring, it&rsquo;s marketing, it&rsquo;s corporate,</p>
<p>as opposed to, I wanted to do some fun,</p>
<p>this is me, like a shout out to iRobot,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re not letting me get into the robot.</p>
<p>Yeah, well there&rsquo;s an aspect of,</p>
<p>that could be benefiting from a culture of modularity,</p>
<p>like add ons, and that could actually dramatically help.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen that over history,</p>
<p>I mean, Apple is an example of a company like that,</p>
<p>or the, like, I can see what your point is,</p>
<p>is that you have something that needs to be,</p>
<p>it needs to be adopted broadly,</p>
<p>the concept needs to be adopted broadly.</p>
<p>And if you want to go beyond this one device,</p>
<p>you need to engage this community.</p>
<p>Yeah, and connecting to the open source that you said.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a programmer,</p>
<p>one of the most impactful programmers ever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve led many programmers, you lead many programmers.</p>
<p>What are some, from a programmer perspective,</p>
<p>what makes a good programmer?</p>
<p>What makes a productive programmer?</p>
<p>Is there a device you can give</p>
<p>to be a great programmer in this world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great, great question.</p>
<p>And there are times in my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably answer this even better</p>
<p>than I hope maybe give an answer today.</p>
<p>Because I thought about this numerous times,</p>
<p>like right now I&rsquo;ve spent on so much time</p>
<p>recently hiring salespeople that,</p>
<p>That your mind is a little bit on something else.</p>
<p>On something else.</p>
<p>But I reflected on the past,</p>
<p>and also, you know, I have some really,</p>
<p>the only way I can do this,</p>
<p>is I have some really great programmers that I work with,</p>
<p>who lead the teams that they lead.</p>
<p>And my goal is to inspire them and hopefully help them,</p>
<p>encourage them, and be,</p>
<p>help them encourage with their teams.</p>
<p>I would say there&rsquo;s a number of things, couple things.</p>
<p>One is curiosity.</p>
<p>Like you, I think a programmer without curiosity</p>
<p>is mundane.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ll lose interest, you won&rsquo;t do your best work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of, it&rsquo;s an affect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, are you,</p>
<p>you have some curiosity about things.</p>
<p>I think two, don&rsquo;t try to do everything at once.</p>
<p>Recognize that you&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;re limited as humans.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re limited as a human.</p>
<p>And each one of us are limited in different ways.</p>
<p>You know, we all have our different strengths and skills.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s adapting the art of programming to your skills.</p>
<p>One of the things that always works,</p>
<p>is to limit what you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>Right, so, if you&rsquo;re part of a team,</p>
<p>usually maybe somebody else has put the architecture together</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gotten given a portion for you if you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not part of a team,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of breaking down the problem into smaller parts,</p>
<p>is essential for you to make progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to take on a big project</p>
<p>and try to do it all at once, and you get lost.</p>
<p>And then you do it badly.</p>
<p>And so thinking about, you know,</p>
<p>very concretely what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>defining the inputs and outputs,</p>
<p>defining what you want to get done.</p>
<p>Even just talking about that and like writing down</p>
<p>before you write code, just what are you trying to accomplish?</p>
<p>I mean, very specific about it, really, really helps.</p>
<p>I think using other people&rsquo;s work, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid that somehow you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>like you should do it all.</p>
<p>Like, nobody does.</p>
<p>Stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>And copy and paste from Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Copy and paste from Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t just copy and paste,</p>
<p>this is particularly relevant in the era of Codex</p>
<p>and the auto generated code, which is essentially,</p>
<p>I see as an indexing of Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Secondly, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a search engine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a search engine over Stack Overflow, basically.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, I mean, we&rsquo;ve had this for a while.</p>
<p>But really, you want to cut and paste, but not blindly.</p>
<p>Like, absolutely I&rsquo;ve cut and paste to understand,</p>
<p>but then you understand.</p>
<p>Oh, this is what this means.</p>
<p>Oh, this is what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And understand as much as you can.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s critical, that&rsquo;s where the curiosity comes in.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just blindly cutting and pasting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna understand.</p>
<p>So understand, and then be sensitive to hype cycles.</p>
<p>Right, every few often there&rsquo;s always a,</p>
<p>oh, test driven development is the answer.</p>
<p>Oh, object oriented is the answer.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s always an answer.</p>
<p>Agile is the answer.</p>
<p>Be cautious of jumping onto a hype cycle.</p>
<p>Like, likely there&rsquo;s signal.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a thing there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually valuable, you can learn from.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost certainly not the answer</p>
<p>to everything you need.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw</p>
<p>from you having created NumPy and SciPy?</p>
<p>Like, in service of sort of answering the question</p>
<p>of what it takes to be a great programmer</p>
<p>and giving advice to people.</p>
<p>How can you be the next person to create a SciPy?</p>
<p>Yeah, so one is listen.</p>
<p>To?</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>To who?</p>
<p>To people that have a problem, right?</p>
<p>Which is everybody, right?</p>
<p>But listen, and listen to many.</p>
<p>And then try to, and then do.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re gonna have to do an experiment, you know?</p>
<p>Do, fall down, don&rsquo;t be afraid to fall down.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid, the first thing you do</p>
<p>is probably gonna suck, and that&rsquo;s okay, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly, I think iteration is the key to innovation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost that psychological hesitation we have</p>
<p>to just iterate.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, we know it&rsquo;s not great,</p>
<p>but next time it&rsquo;ll be better.</p>
<p>I mean, just keep learning and keep improving.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an attitude.</p>
<p>And then it doesn&rsquo;t take intense concentration, right?</p>
<p>Good things don&rsquo;t happen just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not quite like TikTok or like Facebook, you know?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t scroll your way to good programming, right?</p>
<p>There are sincere hours of deep,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be afraid of the deep problem.</p>
<p>Like, often people will run away from something</p>
<p>because, oh, I can&rsquo;t solve this.</p>
<p>And you might be right, but give it an hour.</p>
<p>Give it a couple of hours and see.</p>
<p>And just five minutes, not gonna give you that.</p>
<p>Was it lonely when you were building SciPy and NumPy?</p>
<p>Hugely, yeah, absolutely lonely,</p>
<p>in the sense of you had to have an inner drive,</p>
<p>and that inner drive for me always comes from,</p>
<p>I have to see that this is right in some angle.</p>
<p>I have to believe it, that this is the right approach,</p>
<p>the right thing to do.</p>
<p>With SciPy, it was like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>the world needs libraries and Python.</p>
<p>Clearly Python&rsquo;s popular enough</p>
<p>with enough influential people to start,</p>
<p>and it needs more libraries.</p>
<p>So that is a good in and of itself.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna go do that good.</p>
<p>So find a good, find a thing that you know is good</p>
<p>and just work on it.</p>
<p>So that has to happen, and it is.</p>
<p>And you kind of have to have enough realization</p>
<p>of your mission to be okay with the naysayer</p>
<p>or the fact that not everybody joins you at front.</p>
<p>In fact, one thing I&rsquo;ve talked to people a lot,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of projects come, and some fail.</p>
<p>Not everything I&rsquo;ve done has actually worked perfectly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a bunch of stuff that, okay,</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t really work, or this isn&rsquo;t working, and why.</p>
<p>But you see the patterns, and one of the key things is</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even know for six months.</p>
<p>I say 18 months right now.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re starting a new project,</p>
<p>you gotta give it a good 18 month run</p>
<p>before you even know if the feedback&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna know in six months.</p>
<p>You might have the perfect thing,</p>
<p>but six months from now, it&rsquo;s still kind of still emerging.</p>
<p>So give it time, because you&rsquo;re dealing with humans,</p>
<p>and humans have an inertial energy</p>
<p>that just doesn&rsquo;t change that quickly, so.</p>
<p>Let me ask a silly question, but like you said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focused on the sales side of things currently,</p>
<p>but back when you were actively programming,</p>
<p>maybe in the 90s, you talked about IDEs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a setup that you have that brings you joy?</p>
<p>Keyboard, number of screens, Linux.</p>
<p>I do still like to program some.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as much as I used to.</p>
<p>I have two projects I&rsquo;m super interested in,</p>
<p>trying to find funding for them,</p>
<p>trying to figure out teams for them,</p>
<p>but I could talk about those.</p>
<p>But what I, yeah, I&rsquo;m an Emacs guy.</p>
<p>Great, thank the superior editor, everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got, I don&rsquo;t often delete tweets,</p>
<p>but one of the tweets I deleted</p>
<p>when I said Emacs was better than Vim,</p>
<p>and then the hate I got from it.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m walking away from this.</p>
<p>I do too, I don&rsquo;t push it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just joking, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>but people do take the editor seriously, right?</p>
<p>I did it as a joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your life.</p>
<p>It is, but there&rsquo;s something beautiful to me about Emacs,</p>
<p>but for people that love Vim,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something beautiful to them about that.</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>I mean, I do use Vim for quick editing.</p>
<p>Like Command Line, if I said quick editing,</p>
<p>I will still sometimes use it, but not much.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s simple, corrective signal editor character.</p>
<p>So when you were developing SciPy, you were using Emacs?</p>
<p>Emacs, yeah.</p>
<p>SciPy and NumPy are all written on Emacs on a Linux box.</p>
<p>And CVS and then SVN, version control.</p>
<p>Git came later.</p>
<p>Like Git has, I love distributed branch stuff.</p>
<p>I think Git is pretty complicated, but I love the concept.</p>
<p>And also, of course, GitHub and then GitLab</p>
<p>make Git definitely consumable, but that came later.</p>
<p>Did you ever touch Lisp at all?</p>
<p>Like what were your emotional feelings</p>
<p>about all the parentheses?</p>
<p>Yeah, so great question.</p>
<p>So I find myself appreciating Lisp today</p>
<p>much more than I did early.</p>
<p>Because when I came to programming, I knew programming,</p>
<p>but I was a domain expert, right?</p>
<p>And to me, the parentheses were in the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, there&rsquo;s just all this,</p>
<p>like it just gets in the way of my thinking</p>
<p>about what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>So why would I have all these, right?</p>
<p>That was my initial reaction to it.</p>
<p>And now as I appreciate kind of the structure</p>
<p>that kind of naturally maps to a logical thinking</p>
<p>about a program, I can appreciate them, right?</p>
<p>And why it&rsquo;s actually, you could create editors</p>
<p>that make it not so problematic, right, honestly.</p>
<p>So I actually have a much more appreciation of Lisp</p>
<p>and things like Clojure and there&rsquo;s HyVee,</p>
<p>which is a Python Lisp that compiles the Python bytecode.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s challenging.</p>
<p>Like typically these languages are,</p>
<p>I even saw the whole data science programming system</p>
<p>in Lisp that somebody created, which is cool.</p>
<p>But again, I think it&rsquo;s the lack of recognition</p>
<p>of the fact that there exists</p>
<p>what I call occasional programmers.</p>
<p>People that are never gonna be programmers for a living.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to have all this cuteness in their head.</p>
<p>They want just, it&rsquo;s why basic, you know,</p>
<p>Microsoft had the right idea with basic</p>
<p>in terms of having that be the language of visual basic,</p>
<p>the language of Excel and SQL Server.</p>
<p>They should have converted that to Python 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Like the world would be a better place if they had, but.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s a beauty and a magic</p>
<p>to the history behind a language in Lisp.</p>
<p>You know, some of the most interesting people</p>
<p>in the history of computer science</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence have used Lisp.</p>
<p>So you feel.</p>
<p>Well, especially that language,</p>
<p>when you have a language, you can think in it.</p>
<p>And it helps you think better.</p>
<p>And it attracts a certain kinds of people</p>
<p>that think in a certain kind of way.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Okay, so what about like small laptop with a tiny keyboard,</p>
<p>or is there like three screens?</p>
<p>You know, good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never gotten into the big, many screens to be honest.</p>
<p>I mean, and maybe it&rsquo;s because in my head,</p>
<p>I kind of just, I just swap between windows.</p>
<p>Like, partly because I guess I really can&rsquo;t process</p>
<p>three screens at once anyway.</p>
<p>Like, I just am looking at one and I just flip.</p>
<p>You know, I flip an application open.</p>
<p>So where it&rsquo;s really helpful is actually</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to do, you know,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s data and I want to input it from here.</p>
<p>Like this is the only time I really need another screen.</p>
<p>So now, because you&rsquo;re both a developer, lead developers,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also these businesses</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s salespeople and you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>with large companies.</p>
<p>Operations people, hiring people, yeah.</p>
<p>The whole thing.</p>
<p>Which operating system is your favorite at this point?</p>
<p>So Linux was the early days.</p>
<p>So yeah, I love Linux as a server side.</p>
<p>And it was early days I had my own Linux desktop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on Mac laptops for 10 years now.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is what leadership looks like.</p>
<p>As you switch to Mac.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Pretty much, I mean, just the fact that I had</p>
<p>to do PowerPoints, I had to do presentations</p>
<p>and you know, plug in, I just couldn&rsquo;t mess</p>
<p>with plugging in laptops, it wouldn&rsquo;t project and yeah.</p>
<p>So you mentioned also Quantset Labs and things like that.</p>
<p>Can you give advice on how to hire great programmers</p>
<p>and great people?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say, produce an open source project,</p>
<p>get people contributing to it and hire those people.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you&rsquo;re doing it sort of,</p>
<p>you may be perhaps a little biased,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably 100% really good advice.</p>
<p>I find it hard to hire.</p>
<p>I still find it hard to hire, like in terms of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s not hard to hire</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve worked with somebody for a couple of weeks,</p>
<p>but an hour or two of interviews, I have no idea.</p>
<p>So that instinct, that radar of knowing if you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>or not, that you&rsquo;ve found that you&rsquo;re still not able to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard, I mean, the resume can help,</p>
<p>but again, the resume is like a presentation</p>
<p>of the things they want you to see, not the reality of,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also, you have to understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re hiring for.</p>
<p>There are different stages and different kinds of skills.</p>
<p>And so it isn&rsquo;t just, one of the things I talk a lot about</p>
<p>internally at my company is just that the whole idea</p>
<p>of measuring ourselves against a single axis is flawed</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s a multidimensional space</p>
<p>and how do you order a multidimensional space?</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one ordering.</p>
<p>So this whole idea, you immediately get projected</p>
<p>into a thing when you&rsquo;re talking about hiring</p>
<p>or best or worst or better or not better.</p>
<p>So what is the thing you&rsquo;re actually needing?</p>
<p>And you can hire for that.</p>
<p>There is such a thing, generally, I really value people</p>
<p>who have the affect, that care about open source.</p>
<p>Like so in some cases, their affinity to open source</p>
<p>is simply kind of a filter of an affect.</p>
<p>However, I have found this interesting dichotomy</p>
<p>between open source contributors and product creation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s fully true,</p>
<p>but there does seem to be the more experienced,</p>
<p>the more affect somebody has an open source community,</p>
<p>the less ability to actually produce product that they have.</p>
<p>And the opposite is kind of true too.</p>
<p>The more product focused are, I find a lot of people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people who produce</p>
<p>really great products and they have a,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking over the open source communities,</p>
<p>kind of wanting to participate and play,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve played here and they do a great job here</p>
<p>and then they don&rsquo;t necessarily have some of the same.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s entirely necessary.</p>
<p>I think part of it is cultural, how they&rsquo;ve emerged.</p>
<p>Because one of the things that open source communities</p>
<p>often lack is great product management,</p>
<p>like some product management energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant, but you want both of those energies</p>
<p>in the same place together.</p>
<p>Yes, you really do.</p>
<p>And so a lot of it&rsquo;s creating these teams of people</p>
<p>that have these needed skills and attributes</p>
<p>that are hard.</p>
<p>And so one of the big things I look for is somebody</p>
<p>that fundamentally recognizes their need to learn.</p>
<p>Like one of the values that we have</p>
<p>in all of the things we do is learning.</p>
<p>Like if somebody thinks they know it all,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna struggle.</p>
<p>And some of that is just, there&rsquo;s more basic things</p>
<p>like humility, just being humble in the face</p>
<p>of all the things you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s step one of learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s step one of learning, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time learning, right?</p>
<p>Other people spend a lot more time,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time learning.</p>
<p>My whole goal was to get a PhD because I love school</p>
<p>and I wanted to be a scientist.</p>
<p>And then what I found is what&rsquo;s been written about</p>
<p>elsewhere as well is the more I learned,</p>
<p>the more I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The more I realized, man, I know about this,</p>
<p>but this is such a tiny thing in the global scope</p>
<p>of what I might wanna know about.</p>
<p>So I need to be listening a whole lot better</p>
<p>than I am just talking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changed a little bit actually.</p>
<p>My wife says that I used to be a better listener.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m so full of all these ideas I wanna do,</p>
<p>she kind of says, you gotta give people time to talk.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve succeeded on multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>So one is the tenure track faculty.</p>
<p>The other is just creating all these products</p>
<p>and building up the businesses,</p>
<p>then working with businesses.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people today</p>
<p>in high school and college of how to live a life</p>
<p>as nonlinear and as successful as yours,</p>
<p>a life that they could be proud of?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a super compliment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humbled by that actually.</p>
<p>I would say a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>Honestly, one thing that I&rsquo;ve said to people is first,</p>
<p>find people you love and care about them.</p>
<p>Like family matters to me a lot.</p>
<p>And family means people you love and have committed to.</p>
<p>So it can be whatever you mean by that,</p>
<p>but you need to have a foundation.</p>
<p>So find people you love and wanna commit to and do that.</p>
<p>Cause it anchors you in a way that nothing else can.</p>
<p>And then you find other things.</p>
<p>And then kind of from out there,</p>
<p>you find other kinds of things you can commit to,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s ideas or people or groups of people.</p>
<p>So, especially in high school,</p>
<p>I would say don&rsquo;t settle on what you think you know.</p>
<p>Like give yourself 10 years to think about the world.</p>
<p>Like I see a lot of high school students</p>
<p>who seem to know everything already.</p>
<p>I think I did too.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s maybe natural,</p>
<p>but recognize that the things you care about,</p>
<p>you might change your perspective over time.</p>
<p>I certainly have over time.</p>
<p>I was really passionate about one specific thing</p>
<p>and I was kind of softened.</p>
<p>I was a big, I didn&rsquo;t like the Federal Reserve, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still, we could have a longer conversation</p>
<p>about monetary policy and finances,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a little more nuanced in my perspective</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s one area where you learn about something,</p>
<p>go, ah, I wanna attack it.</p>
<p>Build, don&rsquo;t destroy.</p>
<p>Build, like so often the tendency is to not like something</p>
<p>and wanna go attack it.</p>
<p>Build something, build something to replace it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Build up, attract people to your new thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be far better, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to destroy something to build something else.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I guess, generally.</p>
<p>And then definitely like curiosity,</p>
<p>follow your curiosity and let it,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just follow the money.</p>
<p>And all of that, like you said,</p>
<p>is grounded in family, friendship, and ultimately love.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which is a great way to end it.</p>
<p>Travis, you&rsquo;re one of the most impactful people</p>
<p>in the engineering and the computer science</p>
<p>in the human world.</p>
<p>So I truly appreciate everything you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>And I really appreciate that you would spend</p>
<p>your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>It was an honor.</p>
<p>It was a real pleasure for me.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Travis Oliphant.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with something</p>
<p>that in the programming world is called Hodgson&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>Every sufficiently advanced Lisp application</p>
<p>will eventually be re implemented in Python.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
