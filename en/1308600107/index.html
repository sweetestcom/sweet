    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today is an Ask Me Anything, or AMA episode,</p>
<p>which is part of our premium subscriber content.</p>
<p>Our premium channel was launched</p>
<p>in order to raise support</p>
<p>for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,</p>
<p>which still comes out once a week, every Monday,</p>
<p>and of course is zero cost to consumer.</p>
<p>The premium channel is also designed</p>
<p>to support exciting research being done</p>
<p>at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s done on humans</p>
<p>that should lead to protocols for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance in the near future.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to check out</p>
<p>the premium channel subscription model,</p>
<p>you can go to hubermanlab.com slash premium,</p>
<p>and there you can subscribe for $10 a month</p>
<p>or $100 a year.</p>
<p>We also have a lifetime subscriber option.</p>
<p>For those of you that are already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast premium subscribers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching and or hearing this,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium</p>
<p>and download the premium podcast feed.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are not already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers,</p>
<p>you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so</p>
<p>of this episode,</p>
<p>and hopefully that will allow you to discern</p>
<p>whether or not you would like to become</p>
<p>a premium subscriber.</p>
<p>Without further ado,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get to answering your questions.</p>
<p>And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible,</p>
<p>as thorough as possible,</p>
<p>and yet as concise as possible.</p>
<p>The first question is about how to improve sleep.</p>
<p>In particular, how to improve deep sleep</p>
<p>that is sometimes called slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>This was a question that was asked by Jack Pritchard</p>
<p>and they got a lot of upvotes.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve done multiple full length episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast on sleep</p>
<p>and tools to improve sleep,</p>
<p>including the master your sleep episode</p>
<p>and perfect your sleep episode,</p>
<p>as well as a toolkit that is available</p>
<p>completely zero cost at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a downloadable PDF that lists out</p>
<p>all the behavioral tools and other tools</p>
<p>that you can implement to improve your sleep.</p>
<p>Now, Jack&rsquo;s question is specifically</p>
<p>about how to improve deep sleep.</p>
<p>He asks, I have a sleep analyzer</p>
<p>and I typically observe that I get a lot of REM sleep,</p>
<p>that is rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>For him, he says it&rsquo;s 30% of his total sleep</p>
<p>is rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>But he asks, my deep sleep is often low, around 10%.</p>
<p>And I would like to know if there are any science</p>
<p>backed protocols I can use to specifically increase</p>
<p>my deep sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, so for those of you that may not know,</p>
<p>what is deep sleep?</p>
<p>Now, deep sleep is sometimes referred to as slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>That is slow wave sleep and deep sleep</p>
<p>are sometimes used interchangeably</p>
<p>to describe the same thing.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t necessarily the same thing,</p>
<p>but they fall under the same mechanistic umbrella.</p>
<p>What is that mechanistic umbrella?</p>
<p>Well, when you go to sleep at night,</p>
<p>you cycle through a number of different stages of sleep.</p>
<p>And in the early part of the night,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say in the first half of your night or so,</p>
<p>most of your sleep is going to be slow wave deep sleep.</p>
<p>But then as you transition into the second half</p>
<p>of your night, more of your sleep</p>
<p>will be rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s the typical pattern that is observed</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not disrupting your sleep architecture</p>
<p>with things like caffeine and alcohol.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about caffeine and alcohol in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Deep sleep, aka slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>at least for sake of this conversation,</p>
<p>is vitally important in particular</p>
<p>for repair of bodily tissues.</p>
<p>During deep sleep, you secrete growth hormone.</p>
<p>And in fact, you secrete growth hormone every night</p>
<p>when you go to sleep.</p>
<p>But most of that growth hormone release</p>
<p>is restricted to the first half of your sleep night.</p>
<p>The other feature of deep sleep</p>
<p>is that the dreams that occur during deep sleep</p>
<p>tend to be of a less emotional nature</p>
<p>than the sorts of dreams that one experiences</p>
<p>in rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So just to give a broad top contour</p>
<p>of what deep sleep, aka slow wave sleep, is really about,</p>
<p>it tends to occur in the first half of the night.</p>
<p>It also occurs in the second half of the night,</p>
<p>but in the first half of the night,</p>
<p>most of your sleep is going to be occupied</p>
<p>by deep sleep, aka slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>It is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired</p>
<p>in part by release of growth hormone,</p>
<p>which is involved in metabolism,</p>
<p>but also protein synthesis, muscle repair,</p>
<p>repair of all cell types and tissues.</p>
<p>And during deep sleep,</p>
<p>your dreams tend to be somewhat mundane,</p>
<p>sometimes a little bizarre,</p>
<p>but typically not very emotionally loaded.</p>
<p>That can change if you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with a lot of emotionally laden circumstances</p>
<p>in your waking life, but in general,</p>
<p>the sleep and dreams that occur</p>
<p>in the first part of the night is deep</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not terribly emotionally ridden.</p>
<p>Your body also goes through specific patterns of metabolism.</p>
<p>This relates to recent findings just this last year</p>
<p>in which researchers monitored the output</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s breath and the various metabolic factors</p>
<p>present in the breath, as well as through blood draws.</p>
<p>So basically doing all this while people are asleep</p>
<p>in a laboratory, and they observed</p>
<p>that during the first half of the night,</p>
<p>while people are in deep sleep,</p>
<p>their body is actually metabolizing energy very differently</p>
<p>than it does in the second half of the night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to this in a little while,</p>
<p>but this turns out to be very important</p>
<p>for establishing your metabolism</p>
<p>and the way you regulate insulin</p>
<p>and blood glucose during the daytime.</p>
<p>So all of this is to say that getting sufficient deep sleep,</p>
<p>slow wave sleep is vitally important.</p>
<p>And Jack&rsquo;s asking how he can increase the amount</p>
<p>of deep sleep that he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>because by his sleep tracking method,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s observing far less deep sleep</p>
<p>than rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>Now that raises the question of how much deep sleep</p>
<p>one should be getting overall.</p>
<p>In general, the goal should be to balance</p>
<p>the total amount of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>and rapid eye movement sleep across the night.</p>
<p>However, I would not want people to obsess</p>
<p>over getting exactly 30% rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>and exactly 30% slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>Your body is much more resilient than that.</p>
<p>But the closer those two numbers are to one another,</p>
<p>the better overall architecture of your sleep.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t list out exactly</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;s measuring his sleep.</p>
<p>So I do want to put an asterisk on both the question</p>
<p>and the answer I provide by stating</p>
<p>that a lot of sleep trackers,</p>
<p>whether or not they are whoop trackers or Auras,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re using a mattress-based</p>
<p>or mattress cover-based sleep tracker</p>
<p>like Eight Sleep or other,</p>
<p>is using heart rate and heart rate variability</p>
<p>and body movement to estimate</p>
<p>or to kind of predict whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in slow wave sleep or rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because during rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>you tend to be in what&rsquo;s called atonia.</p>
<p>You tend to be paralyzed.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>And during slow wave sleep, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>But no matter what the sleep tracking method is,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a standard commercial sleep tracking method,</p>
<p>whoop, Aura, Eight Sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>it is an estimate or a best guess</p>
<p>at what stage of sleep you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Whereas when you go into a sleep laboratory</p>
<p>like the sleep laboratory at Stanford,</p>
<p>at University of Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>or other of the great sleep laboratories that are out there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to use other methods, including EEG and EMG.</p>
<p>These are just acronyms that refer to ways</p>
<p>to record brain waves.</p>
<p>They actually are going to try and observe</p>
<p>for rapid eye movements beneath the eyelids, et cetera.</p>
<p>So sleep trackers give you a best guess</p>
<p>as to what stage of sleep you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>They are not perfectly accurate.</p>
<p>At least none of the commercially available</p>
<p>sleep trackers are perfectly accurate.</p>
<p>So we do want to highlight that.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let&rsquo;s answer Jack&rsquo;s question directly,</p>
<p>which is how to increase the total amount</p>
<p>of slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of ways.</p>
<p>First of all are the don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll talk about the dos.</p>
<p>Two things that you can do</p>
<p>to really disrupt your slow wave sleep</p>
<p>are to drink alcohol within eight hours prior to bedtime,</p>
<p>or even at all.</p>
<p>Some people will find that even if they have a glass of wine</p>
<p>or a beer with lunch, that the amount of slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>and sometimes even the rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>that they get at night is reduced,</p>
<p>and that their overall sleep architecture is disrupted.</p>
<p>This has been shown again and again.</p>
<p>Likewise, avoiding caffeine within eight,</p>
<p>and ideally within 12 hours of bedtime would be preferable.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not a caffeine drinker,</p>
<p>obviously you don&rsquo;t have to worry about this at all,</p>
<p>but avoiding caffeine intake</p>
<p>within that eight to 12 hours of bedtime</p>
<p>will greatly assist in you getting more slow wave sleep</p>
<p>and higher quality rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>This has been shown again and again.</p>
<p>And as well, avoiding cannabis use,</p>
<p>and maybe even CBD use within eight to 12 hours of sleep</p>
<p>can be very beneficial</p>
<p>if your goal is to improve the quality of your sleep.</p>
<p>Now, I know a lot of people rely on alcohol,</p>
<p>cannabis, and CBD in order to get into sleep.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s been shown many times in human studies,</p>
<p>and this was discussed in the podcast episode</p>
<p>that we did with the great Matt Walker,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a professor of neuroscience and psychology</p>
<p>at University of California, Berkeley,</p>
<p>and a world expert in sleep and sleep science.</p>
<p>Matt and I discussed the research showing</p>
<p>that even though alcohol helps you fall asleep,</p>
<p>even though cannabis can help you fall asleep,</p>
<p>and even though CBD can help people fall asleep,</p>
<p>that it does disrupt and in many ways</p>
<p>reduce the quality of sleep that one gets.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s disappointing news,</p>
<p>I know, for a number of the people</p>
<p>that rely on cannabis, CBD, or alcohol to fall asleep,</p>
<p>but I would encourage you to check out</p>
<p>the episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>that we did about alcohol and about cannabis,</p>
<p>including some of the health benefits of cannabis</p>
<p>in certain situations,</p>
<p>but also some of the detrimental effects</p>
<p>of both alcohol and cannabis in other situations,</p>
<p>in particular, for improving slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually three major don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s put under the umbrella of cannabis,</p>
<p>THC and CBD in the eight,</p>
<p>and ideally within the 12 hours prior to sleep,</p>
<p>if your goal is to improve the total amount</p>
<p>of slow-wave sleep that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>and your overall sleep architecture.</p>
<p>In addition, it&rsquo;s well-known that avoiding food intake</p>
<p>in the two hours prior to sleep</p>
<p>is going to greatly assist</p>
<p>in the amount of growth hormone output</p>
<p>that you achieve during the early stages of the night</p>
<p>and the depth and duration of slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>Now, I want to place an asterisk on that statement</p>
<p>by saying, if you go to sleep too hungry,</p>
<p>it can also disrupt your sleep.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have to arrange your eating schedule</p>
<p>and your sleeping schedule</p>
<p>such that you&rsquo;re not eating too close to bedtime,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also not going to bed so hungry</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t fall asleep</p>
<p>or that you don&rsquo;t get into deep sleep and stay asleep.</p>
<p>I can personally attest to the fact</p>
<p>that if I&rsquo;m too hungry, I can&rsquo;t fall asleep.</p>
<p>Now, for me, most nights,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to eat dinner sometime</p>
<p>between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>depending on time of year, schedules,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on, traffic, et cetera,</p>
<p>and I tend to go to sleep</p>
<p>somewhere between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m.,</p>
<p>plus or minus an hour.</p>
<p>Again, depending on time of year</p>
<p>and what else is going on in life.</p>
<p>So I normally have that buffer of two hours or so</p>
<p>before going to sleep.</p>
<p>However, there are some nights</p>
<p>where even if I eat dinner around 7 p.m.,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite hungry at 9 p.m.,</p>
<p>and I want to go to sleep.</p>
<p>In that case, eating a small amount of food</p>
<p>ought not to disrupt your slow-wave sleep too much,</p>
<p>but you do want to avoid eating large meals</p>
<p>right before going to sleep,</p>
<p>unless, okay, unless completely fasting</p>
<p>and not eating something late at night</p>
<p>will prevent you from getting into any sleep at all.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s better to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting to sleep</p>
<p>than it is to avoid food</p>
<p>just so that you get increased growth hormone output</p>
<p>and into slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>You know, I have had times in my life</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m working very, very hard</p>
<p>and I miss dinner or something comes up,</p>
<p>and I know some people can fall asleep</p>
<p>quite easily on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to do that,</p>
<p>and in particular, if I&rsquo;m very exhausted,</p>
<p>I also rely on a handful of supplements</p>
<p>to fall asleep each night,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m not dependent on them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been times when I haven&rsquo;t been able</p>
<p>to access those supplements and I can still fall asleep.</p>
<p>But the point is that you don&rsquo;t want to be so hungry</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t fall asleep,</p>
<p>and yet in an ideal circumstance,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re trying to increase</p>
<p>the amount of slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>you would avoid food in the two hours or so</p>
<p>before going to sleep.</p>
<p>If you can avoid food for the three or four hours</p>
<p>prior to sleep and still fall and stay asleep easily,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even better for sake of increasing slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>and growth hormone output.</p>
<p>Now, there are some additional tools</p>
<p>for improving slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>In particular, the transitions between slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>and the other sleep stages.</p>
<p>Because even though, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the early part of your night is occupied primarily</p>
<p>by slow-wave sleep, all night long,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re transitioning from slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>into an intermediate stage of sleep</p>
<p>and then into rapid eye movement sleep and then back again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in the early part of the night,</p>
<p>more of that time is going to be occupied</p>
<p>by slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>The two ways to improve slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>that are well-documented in the literature,</p>
<p>and here we can point to some really nice papers</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll reference in case you want to read further,</p>
<p>is the first one is entitled,</p>
<p>Exercise Improves the Quality of Slow-Wave Sleep</p>
<p>by Increasing Slow-Wave Stability.</p>
<p>Slow-wave stability has to do with,</p>
<p>as researchers call it, the amount of power present</p>
<p>in the different aspects of slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>So this gets a little bit technical,</p>
<p>but this is an instance in which they brought subjects</p>
<p>into the laboratory.</p>
<p>They measured brain waves by EEG.</p>
<p>They had some other measurements as well,</p>
<p>including subjective measures of sleep.</p>
<p>And they looked at whether or not people were doing exercise</p>
<p>or not prior to sleep.</p>
<p>Now, when I say prior to sleep,</p>
<p>I mean, not within six hours prior to bedtime.</p>
<p>In fact, exercising intensely</p>
<p>in the six hours prior to bedtime for many people,</p>
<p>not all, but for many people can disrupt</p>
<p>the total amount of slow-wave sleep that they get</p>
<p>and can also disrupt rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So the conditions of the study were pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>It was a randomized crossover trial.</p>
<p>Basically, they had people either sleeping</p>
<p>and monitoring their sleep,</p>
<p>or they had people doing an hour of exercise</p>
<p>at 60% of their so-called VO2 max.</p>
<p>You can look this up, for 60 minutes, okay?</p>
<p>60% of their VO2 max, that was the intensity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s breathing pretty hard, but not extremely hard.</p>
<p>If we were going to map that to the so-called zone,</p>
<p>zone two cardio being the kind of cardio</p>
<p>you can do steady state while holding a conversation,</p>
<p>this would be somewhere in the probably zone three</p>
<p>or zone four, although that&rsquo;s not exactly</p>
<p>what 60% of VO2 max is going to map to every time.</p>
<p>Think about relatively challenging cardiovascular output</p>
<p>for 60 minutes, and they had them do that</p>
<p>at least six hours prior to bedtime.</p>
<p>And this is an important and,</p>
<p>they did have the subjects in this study</p>
<p>in all conditions abstain from caffeine and alcohol.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>And what they observed was an enhancement</p>
<p>of slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>So exercise of this sort turns out to be a very potent form</p>
<p>of improving slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>Now I do not know, because the study,</p>
<p>as far as I know, has not been done,</p>
<p>whether or not doing resistance training</p>
<p>or some other type of exercise</p>
<p>would have led to the same effect.</p>
<p>Although I have to imagine that if it&rsquo;s moderately intense</p>
<p>to intense resistance training,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s done far enough away from going to sleep,</p>
<p>prior to six hours before sleep,</p>
<p>that one ought to see the same effects,</p>
<p>although that was not a condition in this study.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very nice study.</p>
<p>They looked at everything from changes</p>
<p>in core body temperature to caloric expenditure.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t see huge changes</p>
<p>in core body temperature changes.</p>
<p>So that couldn&rsquo;t explain the effect.</p>
<p>It really appears that the major effect</p>
<p>of improving slow wave sleep was due to something</p>
<p>in changing the fine structure of the brain waves</p>
<p>that occur during slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>In fact, and this is an important point,</p>
<p>the subjects in this study did not report subjectively</p>
<p>feeling that much better from their sleep.</p>
<p>So you might say,</p>
<p>well, then why would I even want to bother?</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s well known</p>
<p>that getting sufficient slow wave sleep is important,</p>
<p>not just for repair of bodily tissues,</p>
<p>but also for repair of brain tissues</p>
<p>and repair and wash out of debris in the brain.</p>
<p>And that debris is known to lead to things like dementia.</p>
<p>So getting the best quality slow wave sleep</p>
<p>is extremely important for body and for brain</p>
<p>and getting an hour of exercise that&rsquo;s moderately intense</p>
<p>and making sure that you&rsquo;re not doing that exercise</p>
<p>within the six hours prior to bedtime</p>
<p>and avoiding caffeine and alcohol,</p>
<p>certainly within the six hours prior to bedtime,</p>
<p>but I would say in the eight to 12 hours prior to bedtime</p>
<p>would be even better or not drinking alcohol at all.</p>
<p>Or I know there are people out there</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t drink caffeine at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of those people,</p>
<p>but restricting that caffeine intake</p>
<p>to the very early part of the day,</p>
<p>that has been shown to improve the quality</p>
<p>and the overall architecture of sleep</p>
<p>and slow wave sleep in particular.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what this study points to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another tool that can improve the amount</p>
<p>and quality of slow wave sleep that you achieve at night.</p>
<p>This is actually a tool that I&rsquo;ve started using</p>
<p>over the last six to eight months or so.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I believe in getting behaviors right</p>
<p>before embracing changes in supplementation</p>
<p>or prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Behavioral tools consist of do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts</p>
<p>and the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts for sleep are well-documented</p>
<p>in the Master Your Sleep episode</p>
<p>and the Perfect Your Sleep episode</p>
<p>and the toolkit for sleep.</p>
<p>They include getting morning sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>or bright light of other kinds,</p>
<p>avoiding bright light from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>All that information is in the toolkit for sleep</p>
<p>and those other full-length episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Now, there are supplements that can greatly improve</p>
<p>the depth of your sleep</p>
<p>and that can shorten the latency to fall asleep.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not referring to melatonin.</p>
<p>As many of you perhaps already know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of melatonin for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>mainly the fact that most melatonin supplements out there</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually contain the exact amount of melatonin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s listed on the bottle.</p>
<p>They contain either much, much more or much, much less</p>
<p>and that melatonin is a potent hormone</p>
<p>that has impacts on not just sleep,</p>
<p>but on other hormone systems as well.</p>
<p>The supplements that I&rsquo;ve suggested</p>
<p>and that I personally take in order to improve my sleep</p>
<p>are magnesium threonate, spelled T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,</p>
<p>and interchangeably with that,</p>
<p>one could use magnesium bisglycinate.</p>
<p>I do consider those interchangeable</p>
<p>because both cross into cells</p>
<p>and across the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>in much the same way that makes them better candidates</p>
<p>for improving sleep</p>
<p>than some of the other forms of magnesium.</p>
<p>So magnesium threonate, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,</p>
<p>theanine, and something called apigenin,</p>
<p>which is essentially what you find in chamomile</p>
<p>that is the reason why chamomile can make you sleepy,</p>
<p>A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin.</p>
<p>The dosages for those, et cetera,</p>
<p>are described in the toolkit for sleep</p>
<p>and why some people might want to avoid theanine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you,</p>
<p>for those of you that have very intense dreams</p>
<p>or that might sleepwalk or have night terrors,</p>
<p>you might want to avoid theanine</p>
<p>because it can enhance the kind of emotional</p>
<p>and elaborate nature of dreams.</p>
<p>Other people like that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll take magnesium threonate, theanine, and apigenin</p>
<p>as a so-called sleep stack</p>
<p>about 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep.</p>
<p>I do not take them during the day.</p>
<p>There is, however, another supplement</p>
<p>that used in combination with the sleep stack</p>
<p>that I just described or alone</p>
<p>can greatly enhance the quality of your sleep.</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>people who are following a low-carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>who have trouble falling and staying asleep</p>
<p>seem to benefit from it.</p>
<p>And that is so-called inositol.</p>
<p>Now, inositol comes in different forms,</p>
<p>but the form that I&rsquo;m referring to here</p>
<p>in terms of enhancing slow-wave sleep is myoinositol.</p>
<p>There are an enormous number of studies on inositol</p>
<p>for sake of mental health</p>
<p>and for sake of enhancing various aspects</p>
<p>of cellular function and for sake of improving sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just highlight one paper.</p>
<p>The title of this paper will make it clear what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>The Impact of Myoinositol Supplementation</p>
<p>on Sleep Quality in Pregnant Women,</p>
<p>a Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study.</p>
<p>Now, as I just told you,</p>
<p>the study was carried out on pregnant women,</p>
<p>but there have been other studies of inositol</p>
<p>on other populations.</p>
<p>And the major takeaway from these studies</p>
<p>is that inositol can improve the quality of sleep</p>
<p>and can adjust the architecture of sleep</p>
<p>in ways that make it a great candidate</p>
<p>for improving the structure</p>
<p>and maybe also the duration of slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>in particular.</p>
<p>I find that if I&rsquo;m following a lower-carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>which I do from time to time,</p>
<p>I sometimes have trouble falling asleep,</p>
<p>or if I eat four to six hours prior to bedtime,</p>
<p>then I tend to be pretty hungry around bedtime.</p>
<p>And sometimes if I&rsquo;m exercising very hard</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m working a lot,</p>
<p>even if I eat dinner around seven</p>
<p>and I go to sleep around 10 p.m.,</p>
<p>I might be a little bit hungry still at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>In that case, I find that taking 900 milligrams</p>
<p>of myoinositol in addition to the other sleep stack</p>
<p>that I just described greatly enhances my ability</p>
<p>to fall asleep and to get terrific quality sleep.</p>
<p>I do monitor my sleep.</p>
<p>I do that two ways.</p>
<p>I do that these days with my Eight Sleep Sleep Tracker,</p>
<p>and I use a Whoop Sleep Tracker when I sleep.</p>
<p>The combination of those two taps into different aspects</p>
<p>of sleep tracking, heart rate variability,</p>
<p>movement, et cetera.</p>
<p>In a future episode, we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>what are the best devices for monitoring sleep,</p>
<p>which have certain advantages and others have disadvantages.</p>
<p>But I certainly see it in the objective data,</p>
<p>that is from the sleep tracking data,</p>
<p>and I also observe subjectively</p>
<p>that taking 900 milligrams of inositol prior to sleep,</p>
<p>again, 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep,</p>
<p>can greatly enhance the ability to fall asleep</p>
<p>and for me to stay asleep throughout the night.</p>
<p>I also noticed another effect,</p>
<p>which is that if I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use the restroom, which I often do,</p>
<p>I find it much easier to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to get into kind of looping thought</p>
<p>and things of that sort in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And that may relate to the fact that myoinositol</p>
<p>has been studied in many cases</p>
<p>for its role in controlling anxiety,</p>
<p>that is for reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons,</p>
<p>in fact, one of many reasons why people take myoinositol</p>
<p>during the daytime.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s studies of myoinositol for dealing with anxiety,</p>
<p>for sleep, as we&rsquo;re discussing now,</p>
<p>and even for improving fertility</p>
<p>and things of that sort in particular in women.</p>
<p>So again, 900 milligrams of inositol can be a useful tool.</p>
<p>60 minutes of exercise, as described previously,</p>
<p>can be a tool.</p>
<p>And certainly avoiding caffeine and alcohol</p>
<p>is an excellent tool for enhancing the total amount</p>
<p>of slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>Jack had a second part to his question.</p>
<p>He asked, is having a high level</p>
<p>of rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>and a lower level of deep sleep</p>
<p>likely to cause any health issues?</p>
<p>And to be honest, it&rsquo;s not really clear</p>
<p>that it would cause any specific health issues.</p>
<p>Although if we think about what the specific roles</p>
<p>of slow wave sleep versus rapid eye movement sleep are,</p>
<p>again, rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>being laden with highly emotional dreams,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thought to act as a sort of trauma release</p>
<p>where people are paralyzed in body,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a healthy paralysis,</p>
<p>the so-called sleep atonia,</p>
<p>but undergoing some pretty emotional stuff</p>
<p>within their dreams.</p>
<p>And there is a lack of ability for the body</p>
<p>to secrete adrenaline during rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s thought to be important for emotional repair,</p>
<p>if you will, during the night.</p>
<p>Certainly studies where people have been deprived</p>
<p>of rapid eye movement sleep have shown</p>
<p>that their ability to manage emotionally</p>
<p>during the daytime is reduced.</p>
<p>Certainly if you have reduced rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>for multiple nights, that&rsquo;s going to be the case.</p>
<p>The only caveat to that is that there are certain forms</p>
<p>of treating depression that involves</p>
<p>specifically depriving people of rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole other story that was covered</p>
<p>in the podcast episode with Dr. Nolan Williams.</p>
<p>So if you want to learn more as to why that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>check out that episode.</p>
<p>But because slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>which occurs again during the early part of the night</p>
<p>is when growth hormone is released.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s this periodic washout</p>
<p>of debris within the brain,</p>
<p>and to some extent within certain tissues of the body,</p>
<p>you could imagine that reduced slow wave sleep</p>
<p>would lead to reduced ability to recover from exercise,</p>
<p>from injury, maybe even relate to the immune system.</p>
<p>However, I am personally not aware of any studies</p>
<p>that specifically looked at the ratio of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>to rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>And that focused in particular on reduced slow wave sleep</p>
<p>for bodily repair.</p>
<p>Those studies might be out there.</p>
<p>I was not able to find them.</p>
<p>If you are able to find them,</p>
<p>please put them in the comment section.</p>
<p>And I would love to check out those studies.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that one needs to be overly concerned</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not getting a balance of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>to rapid eye movement sleep, that&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>However, and as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>it would be good to strive to try and balance</p>
<p>the amount of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>and rapid eye movement sleep across the entire night.</p>
<p>If you think about it, that will also tell you</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re getting sufficient total sleep.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to open up another set of questions here</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m about to close out an answer to this question,</p>
<p>but I do often get asked the question</p>
<p>whether or not four hours is enough,</p>
<p>or six hours is enough, or eight hours is enough.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s impossible to know exactly how much sleep</p>
<p>each individual person needs.</p>
<p>And of course, each individual person</p>
<p>will need a different amount of total sleep</p>
<p>depending on the amount of stress and physical strain</p>
<p>and various other things they&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>in their daily waking life.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s generally the case that kids and people</p>
<p>that are undergoing puberty and certainly in early infancy</p>
<p>need more sleep than adults do.</p>
<p>So as you age, you do in fact need less sleep.</p>
<p>One good metric of whether or not</p>
<p>you are getting enough sleep is whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sleepy during the daytime or not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re falling asleep a lot during the daytime,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not getting enough sleep at night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of a duh, but it&rsquo;s an important duh</p>
<p>to pay attention to.</p>
<p>And for those of us like myself that need a 20</p>
<p>or 30 minute nap in the afternoon, great.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting enough sleep at night.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you get sleepy enough</p>
<p>to want to nap in the afternoon,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an indication necessarily</p>
<p>that you are not getting enough sleep at night.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re only sleeping four or five hours</p>
<p>per night, it&rsquo;s very hard to imagine</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting a balance of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>and rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>Once you get into the range of sleeping six to eight hours</p>
<p>and certainly eight to 10 hours per night,</p>
<p>the probability that you&rsquo;re getting a balance</p>
<p>of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>greatly increases.</p>
<p>So if I were to throw out a number,</p>
<p>I would say for most people,</p>
<p>that is for 95% of people out there,</p>
<p>getting at least six hours of sleep per night,</p>
<p>at least, and ideally more like seven or eight</p>
<p>is going to be the goal.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve noticed, for instance, for myself,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m exercising extremely intensely</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going through a lot of emotional</p>
<p>or physical stress in my daily life,</p>
<p>getting six and a half to seven hours of sleep per night</p>
<p>allows me to feel really good</p>
<p>and refreshed throughout the day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s especially the case</p>
<p>if I get that 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon</p>
<p>or use an SDR, non-sleep-depressed.</p>
<p>So I hope that answers your question, Jack.</p>
<p>And there, of course, I&rsquo;m extending the answer</p>
<p>to all others who upvoted that question</p>
<p>or who might be interested in improving</p>
<p>their slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>There are some do&rsquo;s, there are some don&rsquo;ts</p>
<p>that I just described.</p>
<p>I suggest trying various things one by one</p>
<p>to see what works best for you.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to leap</p>
<p>to doing the 60 minutes of exercise</p>
<p>plus the inositol, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, I do encourage everyone to avoid alcohol</p>
<p>and caffeine within the eight to 12 hours prior to sleep.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re not using either of those,</p>
<p>that would be even better,</p>
<p>at least in terms of sleep architecture.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining for the beginning</p>
<p>of this Ask Me Anything episode.</p>
<p>To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes</p>
<p>of these Ask Me Anything sessions,</p>
<p>plus to receive transcripts of them</p>
<p>and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>standard channel and premium tools</p>
<p>not released anywhere else,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Just to remind you why we launched</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really twofold.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s to raise support</p>
<p>for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,</p>
<p>which of course will still be continued</p>
<p>to be released every Monday in full length.</p>
<p>We are not going to change the format</p>
<p>or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>and to fund research,</p>
<p>in particular research done on human beings.</p>
<p>So not animal models, but on human beings,</p>
<p>which I think we all agree is a species</p>
<p>that we are most interested in.</p>
<p>And we are going to specifically fund research</p>
<p>that is aimed toward developing further protocols</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>And those protocols will be distributed</p>
<p>through all channels, not just the premium channel,</p>
<p>but through all channels,</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to give you information</p>
<p>to your burning questions in depth</p>
<p>and allow you the opportunity to support</p>
<p>the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel</p>
<p>is that the tiny foundation has generously offered</p>
<p>to do a dollar for dollar match</p>
<p>on all funds raised for research</p>
<p>through the premium channel.</p>
<p>So this is a terrific way that they&rsquo;re going to amplify</p>
<p>whatever funds come in through the premium channel</p>
<p>to further support research for science</p>
<p>and science-related tools for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to sign up</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab premium channel,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s a cost of $10 per month,</p>
<p>or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.</p>
<p>That will give you access to all the AMAs.</p>
<p>You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll of course get answers to all the questions</p>
<p>that other people ask as well.</p>
<p>There will also be some premium content</p>
<p>such as transcripts of the AMAs</p>
<p>and various transcripts and protocols</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;ll be supporting research</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the premium channel</p>
<p>by going to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
