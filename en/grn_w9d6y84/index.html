for example you have acne and you&amp;rsquo;ve tried everything you did the healthy version of the ketogenic diet you&amp;rsquo;re doing fasting right now but still it&amp;rsquo;s not clearing up this acne and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t tried those two things that would probably work about 90% of the time and i put a link down below of exactly what to do but i want to give you a little understanding of what&amp;rsquo;s behind acne and it has to do with two main hormones primarily a spike in androgens or a spike in estrogen or a combination of both so let&amp;rsquo;s go through this one by one stress induces a spike of cortisol and cortisol can increase androgens and so stress is one factor and so if it is stress you probably are going to know it and you&amp;rsquo;re just going to have to do something about the stress there are a lot of things you can take there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things you can do to reduce stress okay so the next thing is that your testosterone in your body is being converted into a more powerful form of estrogen called dht and that can definitely trigger acne there&amp;rsquo;s a certain enzyme that causes this conversion and low progesterone can allow this conversion to take place but normal or higher levels of progesterone can inhibit that enzyme and this is why certain people when they take progesterone get rid of their acne now what causes estrogen to be lowered in the body usually it&amp;rsquo;s an increase in testosterone now i&amp;rsquo;m going to come back to estrogen in a minute but first let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how to inhibit this enzyme that&amp;rsquo;s making this conversion you can take saul palmetto which has been known to help acne you can also take stinging nettle root which is a good remedy or black cohosh all right now let&amp;rsquo;s switch gears to estrogen and we&amp;rsquo;re talking about estrogen dominance this is where you would see cystic acne but it could be other types of acne as well now we just got done talking about the enzyme that allows the conversion of testosterone to dht now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about another enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen it&amp;rsquo;s called aromatase so there are various natural remedies to take to lower that enzyme stinging nettle root is a good one and the reason i like that one is because it can also reduce the other enzyme that&amp;rsquo;s causing that conversion to that powerful form of testosterone dht so you can kill two birds with one stone and as a side note stinging nettle root is a very powerful anti-inflammatory so if you have back pain it&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s really powerful the second inhibitor of this enzyme is cruciferous vegetables okay so start consuming more of those and there&amp;rsquo;s also something called dim which is a concentrated phytonutrient in the cruciferous vegetables that you can also take to act as a powerful inhibitor of aromatase so that&amp;rsquo;s really good for cystic acne as well so one of the ways that you would know you would have this problem is you have heavy periods you have a problem with your menstrual cycle and then you just need to consume more cruciferous vegetables and definitely stinging nettle root and some dim would be very powerful as well all right there&amp;rsquo;s another situation regarding estrogen dominance and that has to do with your liver your liver is naturally regulating excessive amounts of hormones especially estrogen and there are certain things in there that are creating a buffer and the most powerful remedy for the liver to handle this situation would be milk thistle not only will that help normalize estrogen but it will also increase the production of bile now if you actually even look up milk thistle in relationship to lowering pms symptoms you&amp;rsquo;ll find a lot of great information so if you are aware that you have liver problems or maybe a fatty liver or you have hepatitis or you have a gut i think milk thistle will be a really good remedy to take not to mention getting on keto and especially in a minute fasting next situation is let&amp;rsquo;s say you have pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome now this is a situation where you have too many androgens but that&amp;rsquo;s being caused by high levels of insulin you&amp;rsquo;re eating too many carbohydrates high levels of insulin increase androgens and that can definitely cause not just acne but hair loss a deeper voice and many other symptoms last point is dairy dairy can give you a lot of estrogen so i would avoid dairy if you have acne that alone might just clear the whole thing up so number one avoid all dairy especially milk and cheese number two avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates and the carbohydrates you can have which you&amp;rsquo;ll be excited about are cruciferous vegetables and a lot of them okay that will help you all right number four take certain herbs based on your situation so i&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about that and you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to differentiate maybe which which set of herbs you may need right number five zinc if you&amp;rsquo;re deficient in zinc which by the way is very very common let alone can cause you to have acne cod liver oil is another really good remedy not only because it&amp;rsquo;s loaded with omega-3 fatty acids which will greatly help the texture of your skin help regulate if your skin is too oily or too dry especially but it also has vitamin a and vitamin d vitamin d will help regulate insulin and vitamin a has been known to actually help acne in a big way so calibrate oil is a very powerful remedy and lastly you want to avoid fluoride and i&amp;rsquo;m talking about the fluoride treatments you would get from your dentist there&amp;rsquo;s a really good one and fairly inexpensive one that you can actually just keep in your fridge it&amp;rsquo;s like a little container i&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down below and also in your shower here&amp;rsquo;s the problem tap water is loaded with fluoride and if it&amp;rsquo;s either exposed to your skin or you&amp;rsquo;re drinking it it can really mess up your skin there you have it thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down

tried everything you did the healthy version of  </p><p>the ketogenic diet you&rsquo;re doing fasting right 
now but still it&rsquo;s not clearing up this acne  </p><p>and if you haven&rsquo;t tried those two things that 
would probably work about 90% of the time and i  </p><p>put a link down below of exactly what to do but 
i want to give you a little understanding of  </p><p>what&rsquo;s behind acne and it has to do with two 
main hormones primarily a spike in androgens  </p><p>or a spike in estrogen or a combination of 
both so let&rsquo;s go through this one by one stress  </p><p>induces a spike of cortisol and cortisol can 
increase androgens and so stress is one factor and  </p><p>so if it is stress you probably are going to know 
it and you&rsquo;re just going to have to do something  </p><p>about the stress there are a lot of things 
you can take there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can  </p><p>do to reduce stress okay so the next thing is that 
your testosterone in your body is being converted  </p><p>into a more powerful form of estrogen called 
dht and that can definitely trigger acne there&rsquo;s  </p><p>a certain enzyme that causes this conversion and 
low progesterone can allow this conversion to take  </p><p>place but normal or higher levels of progesterone 
can inhibit that enzyme and this is why  </p><p>certain people when they take progesterone get 
rid of their acne now what causes estrogen to  </p><p>be lowered in the body usually it&rsquo;s an increase 
in testosterone now i&rsquo;m going to come back to  </p><p>estrogen in a minute but first let&rsquo;s talk about 
how to inhibit this enzyme that&rsquo;s making this  </p><p>conversion you can take saul palmetto which has 
been known to help acne you can also take stinging  </p><p>nettle root which is a good remedy or black cohosh 
all right now let&rsquo;s switch gears to estrogen  </p><p>and we&rsquo;re talking about estrogen dominance this 
is where you would see cystic acne but it could  </p><p>be other types of acne as well now we just got 
done talking about the enzyme that allows the  </p><p>conversion of testosterone to dht now let&rsquo;s talk 
about another enzyme that converts testosterone to  </p><p>estrogen it&rsquo;s called aromatase so there are 
various natural remedies to take to lower  </p><p>that enzyme stinging nettle root is a good one and 
the reason i like that one is because it can also  </p><p>reduce the other enzyme that&rsquo;s causing that 
conversion to that powerful form of testosterone  </p><p>dht so you can kill two birds with one stone 
and as a side note stinging nettle root is a  </p><p>very powerful anti-inflammatory so if you have 
back pain it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really powerful  </p><p>the second inhibitor of this enzyme is cruciferous 
vegetables okay so start consuming more of those  </p><p>and there&rsquo;s also something called 
dim which is a concentrated  </p><p>phytonutrient in the cruciferous 
vegetables that you can also take  </p><p>to act as a powerful inhibitor of aromatase 
so that&rsquo;s really good for cystic acne as well  </p><p>so one of the ways that you would know you would 
have this problem is you have heavy periods you  </p><p>have a problem with your menstrual cycle and 
then you just need to consume more cruciferous  </p><p>vegetables and definitely stinging nettle root 
and some dim would be very powerful as well  </p><p>all right there&rsquo;s another situation regarding 
estrogen dominance and that has to do with  </p><p>your liver your liver is naturally regulating 
excessive amounts of hormones especially estrogen  </p><p>and there are certain things in there that are 
creating a buffer and the most powerful remedy for  </p><p>the liver to handle this situation would be milk 
thistle not only will that help normalize estrogen  </p><p>but it will also increase the production 
of bile now if you actually even look up  </p><p>milk thistle in relationship to lowering pms 
symptoms you&rsquo;ll find a lot of great information so  </p><p>if you are aware that you have liver problems 
or maybe a fatty liver or you have hepatitis or  </p><p>you have a gut i think milk thistle will be a 
really good remedy to take not to mention getting  </p><p>on keto and especially in a minute fasting 
next situation is let&rsquo;s say you have pcos  </p><p>polycystic ovarian syndrome now this is a 
situation where you have too many androgens  </p><p>but that&rsquo;s being caused by high levels of 
insulin you&rsquo;re eating too many carbohydrates  </p><p>high levels of insulin increase androgens 
and that can definitely cause not just acne  </p><p>but hair loss a deeper voice and many 
other symptoms last point is dairy  </p><p>dairy can give you a lot of estrogen so i would 
avoid dairy if you have acne that alone might  </p><p>just clear the whole thing up so number one avoid 
all dairy especially milk and cheese number two  </p><p>avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates and the 
carbohydrates you can have which you&rsquo;ll be excited  </p><p>about are cruciferous vegetables and a lot of 
them okay that will help you all right number four  </p><p>take certain herbs based on your situation so 
i&rsquo;ve already talked about that and you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to have to differentiate maybe which which set 
of herbs you may need right number five zinc if  </p><p>you&rsquo;re deficient in zinc which by the way is very 
very common let alone can cause you to have acne  </p><p>cod liver oil is another really good remedy not 
only because it&rsquo;s loaded with omega-3 fatty acids  </p><p>which will greatly help the texture of your skin 
help regulate if your skin is too oily or too dry  </p><p>especially but it also has vitamin a and vitamin 
d vitamin d will help regulate insulin and vitamin  </p><p>a has been known to actually help acne in a big 
way so calibrate oil is a very powerful remedy and  </p><p>lastly you want to avoid fluoride and i&rsquo;m talking 
about the fluoride treatments you would get  </p><p>from your dentist there&rsquo;s a really good one and 
fairly inexpensive one that you can actually just  </p><p>keep in your fridge it&rsquo;s like a little container 
i&rsquo;ll put a link down below and also in your shower  </p><p>here&rsquo;s the problem tap water is loaded with 
fluoride and if it&rsquo;s either exposed to your  </p><p>skin or you&rsquo;re drinking it it can really mess up 
your skin there you have it thanks for watching  </p><p>hey before you go real quick i have 
a course entitled how to bulletproof  </p><p>your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course 
i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to 
bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate  </p><p>and resist your environment much better by
