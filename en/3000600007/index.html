    <p>(audience chattering indistinctly)</p>
<ul>
<li>Great.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good afternoon and welcome today&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jillian Grennan.</p>
<p>I teach the SIF class here at Haas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great pleasure today</p>
<p>to be able to introduce today&rsquo;s guest speaker, Katie Hall.</p>
<p>Katie is the founder and co-chair of Hall Capital Partners.</p>
<p>Founded in 1994, HCP manages over 40 billion in investments</p>
<p>for foundations, endowments,</p>
<p>and large pools of family capital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the largest woman-led</p>
<p>investment companies in the world.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also the co-founder and co-executive chair</p>
<p>of Galvanize Climate Solutions.</p>
<p>Galvanize&rsquo;s unique investment strategy</p>
<p>is helping to accelerate</p>
<p>and scale the adoption of clean technology</p>
<p>and increase the rate of decarbonization.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re all looking forward</p>
<p>to hearing more about that today.</p>
<p>And Katie&rsquo;s work places her</p>
<p>at the forefront of financial leaders who really understand</p>
<p>that the pursuit of financial returns</p>
<p>is in fact compatible with consideration</p>
<p>of environmental and social outcomes.</p>
<p>Here at Haas, we are keenly aware of this important link.</p>
<p>In 2008, Haas launched the nation&rsquo;s first student-led</p>
<p>Socially Responsible Investment Fund,</p>
<p>and today our Sustainable and Impact Finance initiative</p>
<p>is educating the next generation of leaders</p>
<p>and leveraging finance and investment</p>
<p>to drive positive change in the world.</p>
<p>Each year over 150 MBA students</p>
<p>take classes in impact and ESG investing.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be discussing how investment is being leveraged</p>
<p>to create these important social changes</p>
<p>and what we should expect to see in the near future.</p>
<p>As leading today&rsquo;s conversation will be Ann Harrison,</p>
<p>the 15th dean of the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>A renowned economist, Dean Harrison has dedicated her career</p>
<p>to creating an inclusive and sustainable policies,</p>
<p>both through her studies of development economics,</p>
<p>international trade and global labor markets.</p>
<p>She now brings this focused higher education,</p>
<p>here what we can call the greatest public university</p>
<p>and the greatest public business school, in the world.</p>
<p>We are so proud to be celebrating</p>
<p>a special lineup of speakers on sustainability</p>
<p>as part of this semester&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series.</p>
<p>So with that, please join me in giving a warm welcome</p>
<p>for Ann Harrison and Katie Hall.</p>
<p>(all applaud)</p>
<ul>
<li>So, Katie, I just wanna start out</li>
</ul>
<p>by saying we&rsquo;re just so thrilled that you&rsquo;re here today.</p>
<p>This is really exciting for all of us.</p>
<p>Our students, many of those in the room,</p>
<p>many of those who are watching</p>
<p>from their computers somewhere,</p>
<p>and our alumni as well who might be watching</p>
<p>outside of this room are really, really interested</p>
<p>in impact investing, venture capital,</p>
<p>early stage entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>So maybe we could just start out with,</p>
<p>maybe you could just tell us some major trends</p>
<p>and exciting new investment opportunities</p>
<p>that you are seeing at Hall Capital,</p>
<p>particularly coming out of the pandemic</p>
<p>and in this age of transformation and social impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s been quite volatile</li>
</ul>
<p>out there in the world of investing over this past year.</p>
<p>So in some sense, it is a really interesting time</p>
<p>to think about trends</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re at such a point of transition</p>
<p>across so many dimensions.</p>
<p>I mean, the volatility that has cascaded</p>
<p>through the public markets into the private markets and is,</p>
<p>you know, recalibrating how generations of people</p>
<p>are having to think about investments and their prospects,</p>
<p>particularly as you factor in</p>
<p>concern about a looming recession</p>
<p>and what that might or might not generate</p>
<p>in terms of as both opportunities and risks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re against that sort of chaotic backdrop.</p>
<p>We continue to see some really interesting things</p>
<p>from managers really across the board in asset classes.</p>
<p>Certainly in kind of venture capital and early stage,</p>
<p>there remains high-level activity</p>
<p>in things around climate, climate investing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really interesting things</p>
<p>probably in the public/private</p>
<p>world of biotech and the intersection of technology</p>
<p>and sort of more traditional biotech investing.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s just been a wild mess of companies</p>
<p>that went public too soon</p>
<p>and are still incredibly interesting</p>
<p>and so now there&rsquo;s real interesting things to do there.</p>
<p>And just more broadly in terms of different industries,</p>
<p>different companies that are part of</p>
<p>kind of transforming systems.</p>
<p>I mean, we are really at the point</p>
<p>of entire systems of our infrastructure</p>
<p>undergoing radical changes and need to go radical changes.</p>
<p>And those are the opportunities</p>
<p>and companies that are part of that</p>
<p>are where we think there&rsquo;s interesting things to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>So let me just follow-up on that a little bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we think of the venture capital industry</p>
<p>as really primarily fueling</p>
<p>the development of the tech industry, right?</p>
<p>But beyond tech, what&rsquo;s the role for venture capital</p>
<p>in other sectors, in the energy sector,</p>
<p>in the social impact sector,</p>
<p>even in the, for example, food sector?</p>
<p>Do you see a unique role for venture capital play</p>
<p>in these other areas?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, I think that we see a really important</li>
</ul>
<p>recognition of the opportunity of these transition sectors.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re seeing this in terms of,</p>
<p>particularly around a number of things in ag tech,</p>
<p>again, everything&rsquo;s tech, right, climate tech, ag tech,</p>
<p>but as systems are needed to change,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of activity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just in devices or kind of hard technology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s other parts of</p>
<p>really interesting software solutions</p>
<p>and software tools that are being built</p>
<p>to measure or increase efficiency.</p>
<p>So across all of those different dimensions</p>
<p>there is a lot of activity</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s moved beyond just sort of the, you know,</p>
<p>only kind of, you know, SaaS</p>
<p>or only sort of, you know, something sort of</p>
<p>for consumer products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Huh, interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn a little bit to Hall Capital.</p>
<p>So Hall Capital has this framework</p>
<p>which you call Full Consequence Investing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wondering if you can explain to me and our audience</p>
<p>what do you mean by Full Consequence Investing,</p>
<p>how do you use it at Hall Capital to make decisions?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure our audience is wondering,</p>
<p>do you use it for your whole portfolio</p>
<p>or do you use it only for certain kinds of funds?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure. So just to give a little bit more context.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Hall Capital is a firm that works,</p>
<p>as we said in the introduction,</p>
<p>with families, foundations, endowments,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re building typically</p>
<p>global multi-asset class portfolios.</p>
<p>So Hall Capital&rsquo;s rule is to evaluate</p>
<p>and identify investment managers</p>
<p>that we will then hire to fill out</p>
<p>part of an overall portfolio.</p>
<p>So in Hall Capital land,</p>
<p>we look at a whole range of different investment managers.</p>
<p>And the Full Consequence Investing came about,</p>
<p>I actually coined that phrase and then something,</p>
<p>we trademark it, in, like, 2013</p>
<p>and it really came about because I was so frustrated</p>
<p>by how everybody was using terms in different ways.</p>
<p>So people were talking about impact investing</p>
<p>or SRI investing or ESG investing</p>
<p>and everybody got something different by it</p>
<p>and, you know, had different embedded return expectations</p>
<p>and different&hellip;</p>
<p>So we thought that for us,</p>
<p>kind of ESG investing, us Hall Capital,</p>
<p>ESG investing really was about deep fundamental investing</p>
<p>rooted in a belief that if you are using your human capital,</p>
<p>your human resources, your physical resources,</p>
<p>and your financial resources in the most sustainable way</p>
<p>and actually looking at those in a really holistic way</p>
<p>and considering the consequences</p>
<p>of all the different parts of your business strategy</p>
<p>that you would make, you the company,</p>
<p>would make better decisions,</p>
<p>you would be a stronger company,</p>
<p>and ultimately a more profitable company.</p>
<p>So our formulation of ESG is trying to get at this idea</p>
<p>that we think that incorporating those</p>
<p>is actually an additive factor</p>
<p>to companies&rsquo; kind of trajectories,</p>
<p>and ultimately investment managers</p>
<p>who emphasize that will be making better choices.</p>
<p>So today, across all the different asset classes,</p>
<p>we basically map out our investment managers.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s stipulate,</p>
<p>we only invest with people that are of integrity,</p>
<p>that are doing good work, you know.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d lop off one end of the tail,</p>
<p>maybe a pretty fat tail, I might add.</p>
<p>But we lop off.</p>
<p>And so our managers,</p>
<p>we would consider sort of traditional investment managers</p>
<p>that are fundamental factors</p>
<p>in looking at all of those that are integrated,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of our halfway there.</p>
<p>And then people that have ESG factors is really a central,</p>
<p>deeply embedded part of their strategy.</p>
<p>And when we are building FCI-only portfolios,</p>
<p>we are only using those managers who,</p>
<p>the issue factor analysis is central to their policy.</p>
<p>And we actually, you know,</p>
<p>this is something that was relatively straightforward</p>
<p>in equities, increasingly doable and not that problematic</p>
<p>in kinda venture and private equity,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking to build diversified portfolios,</p>
<p>quite doable in fixed income</p>
<p>although you have to accept the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>you have to have an opinion about the government</p>
<p>as being a good actor, right?</p>
<p>People have different views on that,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s stipulate that in ours.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been hard in hedge fund land.</p>
<p>And that has a lot to do</p>
<p>with the fact that it&rsquo;s shorter duration investments.</p>
<p>And most good fundamental investing,</p>
<p>regardless of asset class,</p>
<p>does need some duration to pay off.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve worked with different managers</p>
<p>and that is a place where it&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>a bit more of a filter-based</p>
<p>incorporation of ESG factors to meet it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s an area that we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>growing interest from different,</p>
<p>particularly with families and foundations both</p>
<p>are very, very interested in building</p>
<p>sort of global multi-asset class, FCI portfolios</p>
<p>that really have the, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to have an expected discount of your return,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a straight up return</p>
<p>just like all the other portfolios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just so in awe of everything that you do</p>
<p>and the fact that you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>$41 billion in assets under management,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the largest</p>
<p>women-led investment companies in the world,</p>
<p>but at the same time you work</p>
<p>in a very male-dominated industry.</p>
<p>So I have seen that despite the fact</p>
<p>that it is a very male-dominated industry,</p>
<p>at least 50% of your senior managers are women.</p>
<p>Congratulations on that. - [Katie] Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I&rsquo;m curious.</li>
</ul>
<p>What were some of the biggest challenges</p>
<p>that you face as a woman in setting up your fund?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, we were talking a little bit earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>about sort of winding paths and how things work out,</p>
<p>and I would say that I experienced those biases</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>My first job out of business school,</p>
<p>I went to one down in the Peninsula,</p>
<p>was at a big investment bank.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was still just ridiculously old school.</p>
<p>And there was very clear cases of,</p>
<p>particularly around compensation,</p>
<p>bonus compensation that, you know,</p>
<p>the guy before me was treated differently than us.</p>
<p>I made a choice really early in my career</p>
<p>to sort of kind of opt out of that, right?</p>
<p>I only worked for two years</p>
<p>at a big firm after business school</p>
<p>and then I went and joined my friend Tom Steyer,</p>
<p>who I have come back around,</p>
<p>in what was then a very small hedge fund,</p>
<p>became a big hedge fund.</p>
<p>So I went to work in Peni,</p>
<p>and I left then three years later to start my own.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had the luxury of being able</p>
<p>to create my own cultures, my own environments,</p>
<p>and build things the way that I think they should be</p>
<p>and, you know, that has really paid off.</p>
<p>I think that it is also something that,</p>
<p>as we have built Galvanize,</p>
<p>which we, Tom and I just started a year plus ago,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been very intentional about having,</p>
<p>that that company too is 50/50, men and women,</p>
<p>and with interesting diversity across multiple dimensions,</p>
<p>and we think we&rsquo;re stronger and more attractive for it.</p>
<p>But it was because I actually said, you know,</p>
<p>I definitely wasn&rsquo;t gonna stay in the system,</p>
<p>I was gonna just build outside the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>So let me follow-up on that question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have these incredible students here at Berkeley Haas,</p>
<p>who, many of them, are very interested</p>
<p>in finance and venture capital,</p>
<p>but many of them who also wanna build a more equitable,</p>
<p>sustainable and inclusive world,</p>
<p>what would your advice to them be</p>
<p>in proceeding along this path that you have pioneered?</p>
<p>How do you do both of those things?</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s so many different steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that at a personal level it has very much to do</p>
<p>with how you choose to spend your time</p>
<p>and the type of firms that you work for</p>
<p>and the influences that you could have</p>
<p>in terms of changing or modifying cultures.</p>
<p>And a big part of that, I think,</p>
<p>comes from being as brutally aware as you can be</p>
<p>of your own biases, we all have our biases and limitations,</p>
<p>and have things built into the systems</p>
<p>that sort of counterbalance that.</p>
<p>I think it also is a view of,</p>
<p>you know, cumulative experience, right?</p>
<p>It might make sense to gain one set of experiences</p>
<p>at a particular firm for a period of time</p>
<p>to give you the platform and the capacity and the power,</p>
<p>I use that word intentionally, to do something on your own</p>
<p>and be in a more of a directive model.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] So like what you did. - So what I did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You started in a more traditional area</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and then you moved.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much where you start, but&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>I very much think that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that as you&rsquo;re evaluating jobs, you know,</p>
<p>pay a lot of attention to sort of the culture</p>
<p>and the things because you want,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to go that route,</p>
<p>you wanna be able to accomplish</p>
<p>and gain the learnings that you want that then are useful</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a position to do more.</p>
<p>But I also think that there is a lot of things</p>
<p>that are happening and I do,</p>
<p>you know, coming back to some of the early points,</p>
<p>I think that, again, this is a little bit</p>
<p>I wear my Galvanize hat,</p>
<p>but when there&rsquo;s huge transitions and huge change</p>
<p>in areas that are mission-aligned</p>
<p>that are around climate or around solving societal problems,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just really interesting opportunity,</p>
<p>and those firms exist.</p>
<p>And so you can also, you know, increasingly push</p>
<p>to find those firms that are thinking that way.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned Galvanize Climate Solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>several times, so maybe we can just talk about that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure. - So this is a new venture,</li>
</ul>
<p>a new investment platform that you founded with Tom Steyer,</p>
<p>and we would love to hear more about it.</p>
<p>So tell us what kind of investments are you making.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a question, maybe you could talk</p>
<p>after you talk about that a little bit,</p>
<p>and this is a question that we always ask in this area,</p>
<p>how are you going to measure impact?</p>
<ul>
<li>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a huge issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could probably spend the entire afternoon</p>
<p>just on that topic alone of impact measurement.</p>
<p>But let me start with a little bit of an intro to Galvanize.</p>
<p>So Tom and I actually go,</p>
<p>Tom Steyer and I go way back.</p>
<p>We met at our very first jobs as analysts</p>
<p>at Morgan Stanley in New York,</p>
<p>where we both were working there,</p>
<p>went to that other business school,</p>
<p>and then went back to New York,</p>
<p>and then, as I&rsquo;d said, I joined him as his partner in 1986,</p>
<p>a long time ago.</p>
<p>And so we have been each other&rsquo;s sort of sounding boards,</p>
<p>advisors, confidantes for a long time.</p>
<p>And when Tom left Farallon in 2012,</p>
<p>some of you may have encountered him,</p>
<p>he really was one of the leading climate leaders, advocates.</p>
<p>He was more than a gadfly, you know.</p>
<p>Very much, you know, strong voices.</p>
<p>And then sort of in the early part of 2021,</p>
<p>Tom was thinking a lot about what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>He had his foray into presidential politics,</p>
<p>like what he wanted to do with his capital and his time</p>
<p>kind of for the next chapter</p>
<p>since he had no interest in retiring,</p>
<p>I had no interest in retiring,</p>
<p>although I was stepping back to sort of just a part-time</p>
<p>position at Hall Capital.</p>
<p>And we really kept coming around to the view</p>
<p>that the existential crisis of our time is climate.</p>
<p>This is an area that we know needs trillions of dollars</p>
<p>of capital marshaled.</p>
<p>And we thought that we could do what each of us had done</p>
<p>in our respective careers,</p>
<p>which is, you know, build investment platform</p>
<p>to marshal that, at least some of that capital</p>
<p>to, you know, accelerate, to provide,</p>
<p>to develop solutions to the climate crisis.</p>
<p>And, you know, it really help move the transition</p>
<p>to a net zero global economy along more rapidly.</p>
<p>And we thought we could do it</p>
<p>in a different kind of investment firm</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have to be like all of these other firms</p>
<p>that looked a certain way.</p>
<p>And we really thought that it had to be</p>
<p>a big significant platform.</p>
<p>We needed to take a leadership position in it</p>
<p>and that we needed to be able to invest</p>
<p>in a way that generated compelling returns</p>
<p>for our investors, that it wasn&rsquo;t concessionary,</p>
<p>but that it would be one of the leading investment firms</p>
<p>as well as a deeply mission-driven organization.</p>
<p>And we plan on having</p>
<p>a number of different investment strategies over time.</p>
<p>We started with investment strategy</p>
<p>really focused on kind of early stage VC and growth capital,</p>
<p>but we have a team</p>
<p>that is going to be a public activist strategy.</p>
<p>Actually just today we announced a person</p>
<p>that is joining to build real estate strategy,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s across a whole range of strategies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to have.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been just a crazy rocket ship of the past 13 months</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;ve started.</p>
<p>Just like, you know, we&rsquo;re a startup,</p>
<p>which is all about strategy, capital rating, and people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been really an exciting time to get all the people.</p>
<p>We have been investing in the innovation and expansion,</p>
<p>which is sort of this VC</p>
<p>and growth capital sets of companies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made some initial investments already.</p>
<p>And the whole area of measurement and impact</p>
<p>is a critical one.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the core, right, of what our mission is,</p>
<p>is to have impact.</p>
<p>And so how we measure that is sort of multi-layers,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to vary to a certain extent,</p>
<p>strategy by strategy, with some common themes.</p>
<p>So what we are doing in the innovation expansion arena</p>
<p>is it, again, sort of steps</p>
<p>and at kind of the risk of being a little bit granular,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth kind of getting into.</p>
<p>So we start with kind of the whole pipeline of companies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re looking at and investment opportunities,</p>
<p>and we are assessing them,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re putting &rsquo;em in the kinda three buckets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting them in a bucket of companies</p>
<p>or strategies that can help to rebuild parts of the system,</p>
<p>if we rebuild and replace things that serve old systems,</p>
<p>then by replacing something</p>
<p>we could have a significant reduction</p>
<p>in greenhouse gas emissions,</p>
<p>and/or there&rsquo;s what we call restore</p>
<p>which also includes, you know, sequestration strategies</p>
<p>as well as other adaptation strategies.</p>
<p>So from the beginning</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at investment opportunities and saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this idea, does this company,</p>
<p>does this technology have the capacity?</p>
<p>Is it,&rdquo; if you will, &ldquo;the TAM,&rdquo;</p>
<p>is the total addressable market on this case,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of creating a total addressable climate impact,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it big enough?</p>
<p>Is it big enough that we have, you know,</p>
<p>be kind of in the zip code of something like 500,&rdquo;</p>
<p>if it was adopted universally, you know,</p>
<p>&ldquo;500 mega tons of emission reduction annually?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to scale things</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;re investing in things that have impact.</p>
<p>Like, we start from beginning,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do it as an afterthought, right?</p>
<p>Like, a lot of investment firms</p>
<p>go through their whole investment thing and then say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great investment.</p>
<p>Can we build some climate adjacencies,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really interested in addressing that,</p>
<p>thinking about that up front.</p>
<p>Then we go through kind of our whole range</p>
<p>of regular due diligence, we make an investment,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re asking our companies and ourselves to respond to the,</p>
<p>we were laughing earlier</p>
<p>about one of the things about business in general,</p>
<p>but climate tech in particular</p>
<p>is it is filled with acronyms.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Okay, oh, which one am I talking about now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re using the ESG metrics that came out</p>
<p>of something called the ESG Data Convergence Initiative,</p>
<p>which was developed by a consortium</p>
<p>or association of Institutional Limited Partners</p>
<p>and General Partners,</p>
<p>and it asks a series of questions about emissions,</p>
<p>about renewable energy use,</p>
<p>as well as a number of DEI and governance factors,</p>
<p>you know, trying to get some standardization.</p>
<p>And then we are looking very closely</p>
<p>at company-specific things,</p>
<p>like related to a particular company</p>
<p>is going to aim to reduce the usage of water in agriculture.</p>
<p>I mean, that is something that we can specifically measure.</p>
<p>Number of acres covered, number of uses, you know,</p>
<p>so there are company-specific KPIs.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a really long way of saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>It is case by case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna vary strategy by strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, we were having this conversation earlier.</p>
<p>It is a real problem.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s actually a real challenge</p>
<p>for kind of industry and investors</p>
<p>to find the appropriate balance</p>
<p>between kind of quantitative measures</p>
<p>as well as more, you know,</p>
<p>specific indicators to reflect impact.</p>
<p>And the shorthand kind of just snapshot</p>
<p>either misses too much or oversimplifies.</p>
<p>But the other answer, the long one that I just gave,</p>
<p>is also not completely satisfying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; right, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so much work.</p>
<p>How do you really know you&rsquo;re doing anything,&rdquo; so.</p>
<ul>
<li>I mean, I think this</li>
</ul>
<p>is incredibly exciting- - It&rsquo;s a really exciting area.</p>
<ul>
<li>What you&rsquo;re doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, you are at the forefront of change,</p>
<p>of how do we evaluate all these opportunities</p>
<p>and do it in a way which is successful</p>
<p>both from a business sense,</p>
<p>but also makes an enormous difference.</p>
<p>I mean, I cannot imagine doing anything</p>
<p>more important than what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>One quick question is,</p>
<p>do you have certain sectoral priorities?</p>
<p>So one of the challenges is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some areas which are just dirty areas, you know,</p>
<p>making cement is dirty,</p>
<p>but there are new changes that are coming forward.</p>
<p>So you can make low carbon cement,</p>
<p>you can make low carbon steel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard right now in this period</p>
<p>to imagine a world without using cement or steel.</p>
<p>So are you moving in those areas too</p>
<p>or are you staying out of them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh no, this is a statement across the board at Galvanize,</li>
</ul>
<p>we are working across sort of all sectors</p>
<p>because we really think</p>
<p>that we need to be part of the transition.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny you talk about cement.</p>
<p>One of the investments that we made is actually in a company</p>
<p>that is a sensor company that can help,</p>
<p>that is help to make more precise</p>
<p>and improved mixes of both concrete and cement,</p>
<p>which can significantly reduce the clinker component,</p>
<p>which can, you know, substantially reduce the emission.</p>
<p>So we think we&rsquo;ll continue to see a lot of things</p>
<p>across the board.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look out there in sort of the venture side,</p>
<p>the places that have just scooped up</p>
<p>a hugely disproportionate amount of the dollars</p>
<p>have been in mobility, I think EV and storage,</p>
<p>I think batteries, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just, like, really disproportionate amount.</p>
<p>But we are seeing very interesting things in ag and food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing much harder problems,</p>
<p>but maybe really interesting things</p>
<p>in kind of industrial transformations.</p>
<p>We looked at a really interesting company,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t end up doing it then, for some capital reasons</p>
<p>in plastic circularity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s across the board.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow, that&rsquo;s so interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I do wanna leave us a little bit of time</p>
<p>for questions from the floor.</p>
<p>So I only have a couple more questions,</p>
<p>but I wanna shift a little bit</p>
<p>and think about the role of business</p>
<p>versus the role of the public sector.</p>
<p>So how important, do you think,</p>
<p>the role of private companies,</p>
<p>especially financial institutions will be</p>
<p>in getting to net zero?</p>
<p>I mean, do you think that this whole transition</p>
<p>is really being led by the private sector</p>
<p>and by investment companies in moving towards net zero?</p>
<ul>
<li>I definitely think,</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, we live in a policy world in all these dimensions,</p>
<p>but I think what we have seen</p>
<p>is policy is developing so differently in different regions,</p>
<p>whether it be the EU or certainly here or the UK</p>
<p>or China or India.</p>
<p>And what we have seen simultaneously with that</p>
<p>is a really strong movement from,</p>
<p>particularly European pension funds</p>
<p>and certain demanding change, some US,</p>
<p>and corporations are moving kind of across the board,</p>
<p>I mean, disproportionately</p>
<p>not just the financial institutions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really regular companies who were being demanded</p>
<p>by their customers who were anticipating regulation,</p>
<p>who were depending by kind of their investors</p>
<p>to make change.</p>
<p>I mean, the last number I saw,</p>
<p>something like over 1,500 companies</p>
<p>have made some version of net zero pledges.</p>
<p>Now, probably only a small subset of them actually</p>
<p>know how to get from A to B.</p>
<p>But the power of that momentum is real,</p>
<p>I think going to continue to be quite influential.</p>
<p>Now, you then pair that with the public sector, right?</p>
<p>You have the regulations in the EU that are coming,</p>
<p>that are going to accelerate disclosures,</p>
<p>regardless of what the SEC does at a company level,</p>
<p>you have the IRA, terrible name, I mean seriously,</p>
<p>the IRA, which is actually one of the first significant,</p>
<p>I mean, movement in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>setting up positive incentives</p>
<p>as well as negative incentives</p>
<p>around some of these transitions.</p>
<p>So it will be a combination.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] I see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I think that what we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>from the financial institutions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not leading.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an attempt at leading, again, from some of them</p>
<p>and then they got some pushback</p>
<p>and they start scurrying back.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that we have as much leadership</p>
<p>from the larger financial institutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] I think I know which financial institutions-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we should- - You might be referring to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we should have more leadership. (chuckles)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So you&rsquo;re suggesting it&rsquo;s a partnership with some&hellip;</p>
<p>So let me ask you about one effort</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on right now, as we speak.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC,</p>
<p>which, as you all know, regulates financial markets,</p>
<p>is proposing some regulatory structures,</p>
<p>in particular, they have released a proposal,</p>
<p>which has not yet been confirmed,</p>
<p>to mandate climate risk disclosures by public companies.</p>
<p>I know they&rsquo;re also suggesting</p>
<p>release disclosing ESG strategies.</p>
<p>What do you think about these proposals from the SEC?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re a good idea?</p>
<ul>
<li>We actually are at a minority,</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting my Galvanize hat on,</p>
<p>but we are at a minority</p>
<p>of a lot of the financial institutions and investment firms,</p>
<p>we are strong supporters of the disclosure across the board.</p>
<p>We think that it&rsquo;s imperfect.</p>
<p>We know how difficult it is.</p>
<p>But we think that until we get to much greater transparency</p>
<p>and people acknowledging what these risks are,</p>
<p>even with imperfections,</p>
<p>then it would be very difficult to make progress.</p>
<p>It would be harder to make progress, let me say that.</p>
<p>And, again, we&rsquo;re seeing it in the EU.</p>
<p>They are kind of requiring many of these disclosures</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that is interesting is,</p>
<p>and we see it play out in the public press too,</p>
<p>is there are such mixed signals coming</p>
<p>about what to do with the information.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I just saw something</p>
<p>that the FDIC is continuing down their path</p>
<p>of particularly encouraging banks</p>
<p>to look at sort of the climate risks and sort of loans,</p>
<p>particularly the smaller banks,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing this scenario work with the big banks,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, okay, so like what does that mean</p>
<p>in a world where you can&rsquo;t get fire insurance</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t get, so there&rsquo;s a bit of a question</p>
<p>as to what end on some of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Huh, yeah, interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t ask you why you&rsquo;re in the minority of supporters,</p>
<p>but maybe what I will ask you is</p>
<p>what do you think needs to be done about greenwashing?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, it is a real thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do think that greenwashing is, to a certain extent,</p>
<p>solved by disclosures</p>
<p>and a better version of impact reporting,</p>
<p>of impact measurement.</p>
<p>I mean, again, both Hall Capital and Galvanize</p>
<p>are registered investment advisors</p>
<p>and, you know, we have to live kind of across the board</p>
<p>by what we say; in theory, we have to be able to backup.</p>
<p>And I think that I don&rsquo;t have any trouble</p>
<p>with a more pointed requirement to be precise.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you see these SEC proposals</li>
</ul>
<p>as a way to address the problems of greenwashing?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it helps. I think it helps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, you know, today most,</p>
<p>and this gets back to sort of these different coalitions</p>
<p>about impact reporting, impact measurement,</p>
<p>most impact reports are used for marketing</p>
<p>or for kind of a compliance thing</p>
<p>with a certain subset of investors.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t used broadly to delineate or amplify strategy.</p>
<p>And I do think that if you actually</p>
<p>could get to a better version of people reporting on impact,</p>
<p>it would go a long way towards addressing this greenwashing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is actually my last question.</p>
<p>So if you have a question after I finish this question,</p>
<p>you can go to the back of the room</p>
<p>and ask your question at the mic,</p>
<p>and please identify yourself first.</p>
<p>But let me just ask my very last question,</p>
<p>which is, you know, we have a community</p>
<p>which is really incredibly excited</p>
<p>about the opportunities for investment</p>
<p>in these areas going forward.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, I don&rsquo;t know if you hired MBAs,</p>
<p>but if you do hire new MBAs, what would you look for</p>
<p>and what are some of the really</p>
<p>exciting opportunities out there for new MBAs?</p>
<ul>
<li>A, we do hire MBAs at both firms that I&rsquo;m involved in.</li>
</ul>
<p>So check the websites for job openings.</p>
<p>And I just think that,</p>
<p>kind of at any point in people&rsquo;s careers,</p>
<p>the place where there is the most interesting opportunity</p>
<p>is where there&rsquo;s the most chaos and there&rsquo;s the most change.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause that&rsquo;s where you can actually jump in</p>
<p>and do something.</p>
<p>You can actually have a differentiated point of view.</p>
<p>The company that you&rsquo;re working for</p>
<p>can have different point of view.</p>
<p>And so kind of having the confidence</p>
<p>to kind of wade into those messy, chaotic places,</p>
<p>definitely climb is one of them, you know,</p>
<p>ventures one of them,</p>
<p>but a lot of different investment sectors</p>
<p>are being all upended right now.</p>
<p>You see it in the public markets.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, you see it in the real estate markets.</p>
<p>I mean, things that are chaotic, I think,</p>
<p>I personally find that energizing,</p>
<p>but I actually think it is also really,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel like the safe place to look for opportunity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely an exciting place</p>
<p>to look for opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great note on which to end.</p>
<p>So let me open the floor for questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just gonna do it like this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi, Kathryn, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Natalia.</p>
<p>I am doing a master&rsquo;s in Climate Change here at Berkeley.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Katie] Oh, great. - And I spent the last summer</li>
</ul>
<p>at an impact venture capital fund</p>
<p>focusing foreign agriculture,</p>
<p>so most of the things that you were saying</p>
<p>definitely resonate with me.</p>
<p>One of the things that I wanted to ask you</p>
<p>is there has been recent debate</p>
<p>on how should ESG be approached</p>
<p>and whether E is more salient than S and G,</p>
<p>and I was wondering how you approach it in Hall Capital.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>So it is, as we&rsquo;ve seen out in the press,</li>
</ul>
<p>you know, the whole issue about ESG and what it means,</p>
<p>is really complicated and more politically frothed</p>
<p>than it has been for quite some time.</p>
<p>And part of that is because the S and G factors</p>
<p>are just harder to measure, right?</p>
<p>It means so many different things to different people.</p>
<p>So I feel like sort of the focus on the E is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that as a retreat</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause obviously it&rsquo;s central</p>
<p>in everything we&rsquo;re doing at Galvanize,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just easier to dimensionalize.</p>
<p>And so I think people are kind of using that</p>
<p>and falling back, not because it&rsquo;s more salient,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s actually easier to measure,</p>
<p>which gets back to kind of a part of the big problem</p>
<p>across the board.</p>
<p>We at Hall Capital don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that that is kind of the answer.</p>
<p>We actually are still forging ahead.</p>
<p>We are big believers in ESG, again FCI,</p>
<p>and our kind of stylized world</p>
<p>because we actually do think it&rsquo;s the best use of resources</p>
<p>across all those dimensions,</p>
<p>human capital, physical capital, financial capital,</p>
<p>that manifests itself through, you know,</p>
<p>S or G, if you will, for the others.</p>
<p>That is really a source of strength.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Natalia] Awesome, thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey there, nice to see you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good to see you as well, Katie.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Austin.</p>
<p>I actually used to work at Hall Capital before coming here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year MBA student.</p>
<p>My question is for those of us who are involved</p>
<p>in organizations where we&rsquo;re struggling</p>
<p>with gender diversity, for instance, the investment club</p>
<p>we have exactly one senior female lead,</p>
<p>how would you recommend that we try to increase</p>
<p>gender diversity, especially given that we&rsquo;re made up</p>
<p>of a large male group?</p>
<ul>
<li>As you point out, it actually creates a problem, right,</li>
</ul>
<p>because that is self-perpetuating</p>
<p>in how you get into the group.</p>
<p>You know, in other situations</p>
<p>and when we were thinking about our own kind of recruiting,</p>
<p>either at Hall Capital or at Galvanize,</p>
<p>we spend a lot of time</p>
<p>trying to think about what might be systematic,</p>
<p>structural things that are presenting an image</p>
<p>or something that conveys an attitude</p>
<p>even it isn&rsquo;t one that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s about time that&rsquo;s meet</p>
<p>or requirements to join or not, you know, something,</p>
<p>I think kind of a pretty rigorous self-examination</p>
<p>of if there are some of those things that are present</p>
<p>and then essentially combating against that, you know,</p>
<p>if you identify what might be some of those hurdles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably worth asking some people, you know.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>You should be interested in it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the same finance track, you know,</p>
<p>what is it about it that isn&rsquo;t resonating?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Austin] Awesome, thanks so much, Katie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Katie. My name&rsquo;s Monique.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for being here today.</p>
<p>This has been tremendously insightful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a fourth year at Haas right now</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m interested in getting into finance myself.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>you were discussing at the beginning</p>
<p>the difficulties of investing among different asset classes</p>
<p>and how both your firms you guys are working on everyone.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious which one thus far has been the most fruitful</p>
<p>and which one you&rsquo;re most excited about for the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In terms of investment opportunities or investment areas?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Monique] Yeah. - They&rsquo;re different things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, in Hall Capital we&rsquo;re investing</p>
<p>across all asset classes.</p>
<p>And probably the most activity and sort of new things,</p>
<p>interesting things coming out in the venture</p>
<p>and growth capital world over the past couple years</p>
<p>that we might be at a time of rotation around that</p>
<p>as just things are being so dramatically repriced,</p>
<p>things that had been not very interesting</p>
<p>in the public markets are returning to a point</p>
<p>of real, real interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Monique] Got it. Thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Katie.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Emily McCabe</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a fourth year at Berkeley as well.</p>
<p>So you mentioned that we&rsquo;re in a transition period</p>
<p>and I think a part of that</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re seeing historic climate policy</p>
<p>at a federal, state, and local level.</p>
<p>So I have an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned in my studies that there&rsquo;s an opportunity</p>
<p>to reduce emissions in the built environment</p>
<p>because we burn fossil fuels in buildings.</p>
<p>So this is an opportunity for companies</p>
<p>that manufacture electric appliances</p>
<p>to, you know, get off the ground.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious, as you evaluate companies</p>
<p>beyond financial returns at Hall Capital Partners,</p>
<p>is policy analysis a part of that and should it be?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, our job at Hall Capital</li>
</ul>
<p>is to devise asset allocation plans for our clients</p>
<p>and then implement that by identifying</p>
<p>and hiring the best investment manager</p>
<p>to fill out that part of a portfolio.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re a valued investment managers,</p>
<p>we spend a lot of time trying to understand</p>
<p>how they are incorporating policy aspects</p>
<p>and policy changes, but also macro</p>
<p>or other geopolitical things</p>
<p>into their own investment practice.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really where that intersects</p>
<p>in Hall Capital&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Although, again, we need to be aware</p>
<p>both in climate policy as well as other important factors,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s created big headwinds or tailwinds</p>
<p>to just opportunity sets.</p>
<p>At Galvanize, we are deeply involved</p>
<p>in thinking about policy and analyzing that</p>
<p>both as it presents headwinds, tailwinds,</p>
<p>but also with how some of their portfolio companies</p>
<p>can take advantage of it</p>
<p>or how that creates new markets for them.</p>
<p>Again, if we&rsquo;re looking at something</p>
<p>that is going to be measuring carbon footprints</p>
<p>for apparel manufacturers, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different regulatory regimes</p>
<p>that that has different degree of relevance.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re much more closely intertwined</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re at the actual investing in companies,</p>
<p>and I think you need to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Great. Thank you so much. - Sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello? Hello, Katie.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Matthew Pattom.</p>
<p>I am part of the weekend MBA program here at Haas.</p>
<p>So we have heard about climate tech, ag tech, food,</p>
<p>my question is surrounding waste.</p>
<p>So do you see, from where you are,</p>
<p>how important or relevant is it in investing companies</p>
<p>that deal with the big waste problem</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be seeing in the near future?</p>
<p>What is your take on it? What is your visibility?</p>
<ul>
<li>You know, it&rsquo;s a big issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a big environmental justice issue</p>
<p>because of disproportionate impacts on communities.</p>
<p>From an investing area,</p>
<p>there is more that is being done there</p>
<p>in public private partnerships</p>
<p>or through public support or policy</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;re seeing in terms of company transformation.</p>
<p>We have seen some things,</p>
<p>but from kind of getting back to return expectations</p>
<p>and the ability to capture returns,</p>
<p>our model at Galvanize is specifically looking for,</p>
<p>you know, compelling market rate returns.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff, not all,</p>
<p>but much of the stuff we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in kind of the waste systems</p>
<p>is still running through public partnerships.</p>
<p>So it hasn&rsquo;t been as robust in an opportunity set so far,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re looking at different things.</p>
<p>I mean, I mentioned we looked at this big</p>
<p>plastics recycling business and the technology around that,</p>
<p>which was really interesting.</p>
<p>In the end, the problem was hugely capital intensive</p>
<p>about building facilities, really different facilities.</p>
<p>And since most of that runs through</p>
<p>kind of long-tailed government,</p>
<p>local, municipal contracts, kinda just (mumbles).</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an important area,</p>
<p>but it hasn&rsquo;t one that has been a really</p>
<p>big investment opportunity set for us yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you haven&rsquo;t identified any potential technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>that can make a difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, we haven&rsquo;t right now,</li>
</ul>
<p>but, again, they&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many different things.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen some of these like enzyme,</p>
<p>plastic enzyme degradation or recycling things, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of work being done.</p>
<p>But since, at Galvanize, we&rsquo;re looking to invest</p>
<p>in particular types of companies</p>
<p>that are actually really past the technology risk largely</p>
<p>and into scale up risk.</p>
<p>We have not seen them in that sector yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Matthew] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s a big world and there&rsquo;s a lot going on,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so hopefully we will.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi. Thank you, Katie.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Kaiza.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an MBA student here.</p>
<p>So California, thankfully, is very progressive in this,</p>
<p>but there are many states</p>
<p>which are not as progressive as us.</p>
<p>So I was wondering, you know, what&rsquo;s Hall&rsquo;s policy</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s Hall&rsquo;s initiative right now</p>
<p>to work with those states which are less progressive</p>
<p>to move this forward?</p>
<p>Thank you. - You know, at Hall Capital</p>
<p>we are investing with investment managers</p>
<p>really around the world.</p>
<p>And I would say that their kind of investment disciplines</p>
<p>tend not to kind of run through</p>
<p>that progressive-conservative way.</p>
<p>It becomes much more about a view</p>
<p>of the sets of companies that you&rsquo;re going to invest in.</p>
<p>I would say that in our FCI world, right,</p>
<p>that is a subset that does skew,</p>
<p>that happens to align more</p>
<p>with progressive investment managers</p>
<p>that are sometimes located in progressive places,</p>
<p>but not necessarily.</p>
<p>So it runs more through their philosophies</p>
<p>than sort of the locations.</p>
<p>And in Galvanize world, it&rsquo;s a big issue, right,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really about what the companies are doing.</p>
<p>And there it&rsquo;s really the companies</p>
<p>and what their cost benefit is,</p>
<p>I mean, as a company, we invest in that</p>
<p>optimizes roots of public transportation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a software solution,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually a problem solver for progressive,</p>
<p>I mean, progressive or conservative,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna make up a continuum,</p>
<p>those municipalities are just interested</p>
<p>in solving their problem at a good price</p>
<p>as opposed to something that&rsquo;s deemed climate or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Kaiza] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Katie.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for coming to speak with us today.</p>
<p>My name is Ryan Tan. I&rsquo;m a second year MBA student.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also the president of the Haas Investment Club.</p>
<p>Austin has been- - [Katie] Oh, great.</p>
<ul>
<li>A delight to have with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>So one of the questions we have</p>
<p>is we have a lot of first years</p>
<p>who are interested in public market investing,</p>
<p>specifically they are interested</p>
<p>in having impactful public market investing,</p>
<p>whether in equities or in credit.</p>
<p>However, the one issue that we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>is when students go into,</p>
<p>like, your large asset management firms,</p>
<p>think of like a T. Rowe, a Franklin, a Capital Group,</p>
<p>ESG or impactful investing</p>
<p>is almost like a compliance checklist,</p>
<p>and so what advice do you have for first years</p>
<p>who are interested in public market investing</p>
<p>but would like their work to actually be impactful</p>
<p>instead of, as you mentioned, you know,</p>
<p>you go through the investment ideas</p>
<p>and then at the end you wanna make sure</p>
<p>that the CEO&rsquo;s not having an affair</p>
<p>with one of his, you know, co-workers?</p>
<p>(audience chuckles)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sadly, your last comment doesn&rsquo;t necessarily align</li>
</ul>
<p>with all the other things we were talking about.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s bad behaviors even</p>
<p>in really well-intentioned firms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of a set of human dimensions so I would,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more about a culture</p>
<p>with regard to the actual practice of investing.</p>
<p>Again, there are a growing number of firms</p>
<p>who do have it as central or at least integrated</p>
<p>in my own kind of stylized vocabulary.</p>
<p>I think search out those firms.</p>
<p>I think the other answer</p>
<p>is actually think about what impact really means.</p>
<p>I think a mistake that people make</p>
<p>is translating impact into short-term causality.</p>
<p>And actually I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right way</p>
<p>to think about impact.</p>
<p>I think about, you know, impact in the investing sense</p>
<p>is to think about companies,</p>
<p>the companies in which you&rsquo;re investing</p>
<p>or the asset you&rsquo;re investing and what path they&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some really interesting work being done</p>
<p>by some pipeline companies</p>
<p>who are dramatically trying to shift</p>
<p>kind of the source of kind of their energy,</p>
<p>their transmission.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>You could have high impact by investing in companies</p>
<p>that are trying to really accelerate a transition.</p>
<p>So I would encourage people to think</p>
<p>and push themselves as to what impact really means.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I think that it actually can, you know,</p>
<p>means aligning with and rewarding, if you will,</p>
<p>by investing in companies that are making positive change</p>
<p>and not with those that aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Not just because of that filter,</p>
<p>but because I actually really think</p>
<p>that that is a huge marker</p>
<p>as to prospective, you know, risk or opportunity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ryan] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, thank you for your talk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Shivangi. I&rsquo;m an MBA &lsquo;23.</p>
<p>My question for you is around the combination</p>
<p>of multi-stage investments.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve worked on projects before, for example,</p>
<p>like small modular reactors or electric batteries,</p>
<p>and what we are seeing is there&rsquo;s a trend of,</p>
<p>I guess, deep tech that needs to be commercialized</p>
<p>with the help of both investing in the deep tech itself</p>
<p>but also the infrastructure that surrounds it.</p>
<p>Typically, what we&rsquo;ve tried to do</p>
<p>to accelerate the transition</p>
<p>is you try to break down the risk</p>
<p>to see, like, who can invest in what&rsquo;s known,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the public infrastructure.</p>
<p>So, for example, with a small modular reactor,</p>
<p>that would be everything around the building itself</p>
<p>and then find another investor to kind of do,</p>
<p>you know, the deep tech investment.</p>
<p>In your specific case, you can invest in both.</p>
<p>Would you use that in commercializing</p>
<p>one particular technology all the way through?</p>
<p>Or do you see that more as a risk</p>
<p>where you feel like actually</p>
<p>there should be more than one investor?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, you know, we at Galvanize, in the first strategies,</li>
</ul>
<p>are really focused on investing in companies</p>
<p>that have largely satisfied the tech risk.</p>
<p>And so it becomes a product market fit,</p>
<p>you know, addressable market scale up sets of risks,</p>
<p>and a lot of the deep tech is still science experiments.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s great investors that are doing that.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously Break Through</p>
<p>is leading a lot of that work, and that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s sets of investments</p>
<p>that probably won&rsquo;t have payoff for 7, 10 years.</p>
<p>And we are really interested in companies</p>
<p>helping to scale companies that can have payoffs,</p>
<p>i.e. impact, changing the systems in this decade.</p>
<p>Now one of the things that we are doing, though,</p>
<p>is that we recognize there&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>we think an excess stratification,</p>
<p>which is why we&rsquo;ve actually paired our early stage</p>
<p>and growth investing in one strategy</p>
<p>as opposed to segmenting it</p>
<p>because there has been too much of that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of money being raised</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quasi, you know, that&rsquo;s the de-risk money,</p>
<p>which, again, we can debate about the pricing of that</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s incentives.</p>
<p>And I think we need to have all of these different things.</p>
<p>We need to have longer duration, you know,</p>
<p>higher risk hard tech,</p>
<p>we need to have de-risk quasi bank capital,</p>
<p>we need the kind of things in between.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Shivangi] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh. - Thank you so much.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re out of time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taken up a lot of your time.</p>
<p>We are so grateful for all these insights</p>
<p>and for you visiting us here at Berkeley Haas.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure. Thank you. (Ann and audience applaud)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Happy to be part of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] That was so great. - [Katie] Oh good, good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Ann] I hope you&rsquo;re okay with it being on YouTube.</p>
</li>
