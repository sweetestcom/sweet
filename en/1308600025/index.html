    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>We are now beginning a new topic</p>
<p>for the next four to five episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Before we move into that,</p>
<p>I want to just briefly touch on a couple of questions</p>
<p>that I got from the last episode,</p>
<p>which was related to the science of endurance training.</p>
<p>I described the four kinds of endurance training.</p>
<p>We posted protocols of the specific four kinds</p>
<p>of endurance training at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Just go to that episode.</p>
<p>You can see the download.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a zero-cost PDF.</p>
<p>I got a lot of questions</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s called concurrent training,</p>
<p>which is how to program endurance training</p>
<p>if you are also interested</p>
<p>in strength and hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>or how to incorporate strength and hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>which was in the previous episode, with endurance training.</p>
<p>This can all be made very simple.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, what are you trying to emphasize?</p>
<p>And then emphasize that for a 10 to 12-week cycle.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re mostly interested in endurance,</p>
<p>I would say use a three-to-two ratio.</p>
<p>Maybe get three endurance training workouts per week,</p>
<p>maybe four, and two strength and hypertrophy workouts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re mainly focusing on strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>get three or four workouts for strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and do two endurance workouts.</p>
<p>Start with the minimum number of sets that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to get the result that you want.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not accustomed to doing endurance work,</p>
<p>you would start with the minimum number</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s listed on that protocol.</p>
<p>So if it says three to five sets,</p>
<p>you would start with three, maybe even just two,</p>
<p>and then work your way up by adding sets each week.</p>
<p>I do suggest that people get</p>
<p>at least one complete rest day per week,</p>
<p>although I know a lot of people don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I benefit from that.</p>
<p>I actually benefit from having</p>
<p>two complete rest days each week.</p>
<p>I just continue to make progress that way,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s for strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>or for endurance.</p>
<p>I am a big believer in rest days.</p>
<p>Other people are not.</p>
<p>And those can be active rest days,</p>
<p>hiking, relaxing, et cetera.</p>
<p>After a 10 to 12-week cycle,</p>
<p>then I also suggest taking anywhere</p>
<p>from five to seven days completely off.</p>
<p>You can still enjoy life and do things.</p>
<p>I know for you addicted exercisers</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to loathe to do that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one way to stay injury-free,</p>
<p>keep your joints and tissues healthy over time,</p>
<p>and continue to make progress.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to do that week off, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>None of this is holy.</p>
<p>None of it is a strict prescriptive.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what are you going to emphasize</p>
<p>and emphasize that in terms of the total volume</p>
<p>of workouts that you do and work up incrementally</p>
<p>and then move into another cycle?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I suggest.</p>
<p>So go to hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>You can get the protocol there.</p>
<p>We are now going to move into a new topic</p>
<p>unrelated to physical performance,</p>
<p>starting with this episode.</p>
<p>And for the next four to five episodes,</p>
<p>we are going to talk all about the senses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sight, eyesight, hearing, touch, taste, smell.</p>
<p>And we are also going to talk about this critical sense</p>
<p>that we call interoception,</p>
<p>or our sense of our internal real estate.</p>
<p>Now, the reason that we are talking about the senses</p>
<p>is because if you understand how the senses are perceived,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re about,</p>
<p>what the underlying cells and connections are about,</p>
<p>you will be in a terrific position to understand</p>
<p>the month&rsquo;s topic that follows,</p>
<p>which is all about mental health.</p>
<p>Now, I want to emphasize that if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have any trouble seeing, hearing,</p>
<p>tasting, smelling,</p>
<p>and has an excellent sense of interoception,</p>
<p>I do believe that these episodes</p>
<p>will still be very relevant to you</p>
<p>because they have everything to do with</p>
<p>how you move through the world,</p>
<p>how you make sense of information,</p>
<p>and how you organize your thoughts and your emotions.</p>
<p>I also want to emphasize that we&rsquo;re going to cover</p>
<p>a lot of practical tools.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s episode is going to be all about vision</p>
<p>and eyesight, a topic that&rsquo;s very near and dear to my heart</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the one that I&rsquo;ve been focusing on</p>
<p>for well over 25 years of my career.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not just going to get into the mechanistic details</p>
<p>about how light is converted into electrical potentials</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about practical tools</p>
<p>that you can and should use to help maintain the health</p>
<p>of your visual system and your eyesight.</p>
<p>Very often, young people will say, what should I do?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re always talking about, you know,</p>
<p>neuroplasticity and how it tapers off over time,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a young person, what should I do?</p>
<p>You should absolutely train and support your eyesight.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;re a young person and you see perfectly</p>
<p>or you feel as if you see the world perfectly,</p>
<p>you are in the best position to bolster,</p>
<p>to reinforce that visual system</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t lose your vision as you age.</p>
<p>In addition, you can leverage your visual system</p>
<p>for better mental and physical performance,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who suffers from a clinical disorder</p>
<p>of vision, you have trouble seeing,</p>
<p>or if you need corrective lenses in order to see,</p>
<p>this episode is definitely for you.</p>
<p>And while, of course, I can&rsquo;t make clinical diagnoses,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have a one-on-one conversation</p>
<p>with any of you in this format, nor am I a clinician,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist, not a physician,</p>
<p>I did consult with our chair of ophthalmology,</p>
<p>Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine,</p>
<p>as well as several other people</p>
<p>to really vet the information</p>
<p>and make sure that the protocols that I&rsquo;m describing</p>
<p>are consistent with the clinical literature.</p>
<p>If you have a severe eye problem,</p>
<p>you should be working with a really good ophthalmologist</p>
<p>and or optometrist,</p>
<p>but certainly an ophthalmologist who&rsquo;s a medical doctor.</p>
<p>But I do believe that the information</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to discuss today</p>
<p>is going to be relevant to everybody,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll set the stage for the month on mental health</p>
<p>and mental performance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>When we hear the word vision,</p>
<p>we most often think about eyesight,</p>
<p>or our ability to perceive shapes and objects</p>
<p>and faces and colors.</p>
<p>And indeed, vision involves eyesight,</p>
<p>our ability to see shapes and objects</p>
<p>and faces and colors and so forth.</p>
<p>However, our eyes are responsible for much more than that,</p>
<p>including our mood, our level of alertness,</p>
<p>and all of that is included in what we call vision.</p>
<p>So I just want to take about three, maybe four minutes</p>
<p>and talk about how the visual system works,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s built, and how you are able</p>
<p>to so-called see things around you.</p>
<p>I also want to describe the ways in which your eyes</p>
<p>and your visual system impact your mood</p>
<p>and your level of alertness.</p>
<p>And then we are going to get right into some protocols,</p>
<p>some specific things that each and all of you should do</p>
<p>if you want to enhance your vision</p>
<p>and maintain your vision as you get older.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re a 15-year-old or a 12-year-old,</p>
<p>this episode is especially for you</p>
<p>because your nervous system is far more plastic</p>
<p>than mine is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more amenable to change.</p>
<p>So you can really build a very strong visual system.</p>
<p>And in doing that, and if you adopt specific behaviors</p>
<p>at any age of light viewing at particular times</p>
<p>in particular ways, then you can build an emotional system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also reinforced by your visual system.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about vision.</p>
<p>What is vision?</p>
<p>Well, vision starts with the eyes.</p>
<p>We have no what&rsquo;s called extraocular light perception.</p>
<p>While it feels good to have light on our skin,</p>
<p>while it feels good to be outside in the sunlight</p>
<p>for most people, the only way that light information</p>
<p>can get to the cells of your body</p>
<p>is through these two little goodies</p>
<p>on the front of your face.</p>
<p>And for those of you listening, I&rsquo;m just pointing to my eyes.</p>
<p>As many of you have heard me say before</p>
<p>on this and other podcasts,</p>
<p>your eyes in particular, your neural retinas</p>
<p>are part of your central nervous system.</p>
<p>They are part of your brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the only part of your brain</p>
<p>that sits outside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>In other words, you have two pieces of your brain</p>
<p>that deliberately got squeezed out of the skull</p>
<p>during development and placed in these things</p>
<p>we call eye sockets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a genetic program for the specific purpose</p>
<p>of making sure that three little layers of neurons,</p>
<p>nerve cells got squeezed out</p>
<p>and form what are called your neural retinas.</p>
<p>Now the eyes have a lot of other goodies in them</p>
<p>that are very important.</p>
<p>And those are the goodies that we&rsquo;re going to focus on</p>
<p>a lot today.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lens to focus light precisely to the retina.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who requires eyeglasses or contacts,</p>
<p>chances are you don&rsquo;t do that correctly.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you use other lenses</p>
<p>like eyeglasses or contacts.</p>
<p>There are also other pieces of the eye</p>
<p>that are designed to keep the eye lubricated.</p>
<p>You also have these things that we call eyelashes.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but eyelashes are there to trigger the blink reflex</p>
<p>if a piece of dust or something gets in front of your eye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful adaptation of nature.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t just aesthetically nice.</p>
<p>Costello happens to have very long eyelashes.</p>
<p>He gets compliments about this all the time.</p>
<p>Maybe you have long eyelashes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have particularly long eyelashes,</p>
<p>but the eyelashes are there</p>
<p>so that if a piece of dust or something</p>
<p>starts to head towards the cornea,</p>
<p>the eye blinks very, very fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fastest reflex you own is your eye blink reflex.</p>
<p>We also have these things called eyelids.</p>
<p>Now eyelids might seem like the most boring topic of all,</p>
<p>but they are incredibly fascinating.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how you can actually use your visual system</p>
<p>to increase your levels of alertness</p>
<p>based on the neural circuits</p>
<p>that link your brainstem with your eyelids.</p>
<p>And no, we are not going to have a blinking contest</p>
<p>because I would win and you would lose,</p>
<p>and that wouldn&rsquo;t be fun for you.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what the eyes do for vision.</p>
<p>Basically, the entire job of the eyes</p>
<p>is to collect light information</p>
<p>and send it off to the rest of the brain</p>
<p>in a form that the brain can understand.</p>
<p>Remember, no light actually gets in</p>
<p>past those neural retinas.</p>
<p>It gets to the neural retina,</p>
<p>and we have specific cells in the eye called photoreceptors.</p>
<p>They come in two different types, rods and cones.</p>
<p>Cones are mainly responsible for daytime vision,</p>
<p>and the rods are mainly responsible for vision at night</p>
<p>or under low light conditions, generally speaking.</p>
<p>So basically what happens is if your eyelids are open,</p>
<p>light comes into the eye.</p>
<p>The lens focuses that light.</p>
<p>Light is also just called photons,</p>
<p>light energy, onto the retina.</p>
<p>These photoreceptors, the rods and cones,</p>
<p>have chemical reactions inside them</p>
<p>that involve things like vitamin A,</p>
<p>and that chemical reaction converts the light</p>
<p>into electricity.</p>
<p>Now, that might seem incredibly abstract,</p>
<p>but the way to think about this is very similar to,</p>
<p>for instance, you have touch receptors on your skin,</p>
<p>and when you press on those touch receptors,</p>
<p>they convert pressure, physical pressure,</p>
<p>into electrical information,</p>
<p>and those neurons send it up to your spinal cord and brain.</p>
<p>You can register that somebody or you are touching</p>
<p>the top of your hand as I&rsquo;m doing now.</p>
<p>With the eyes and the retina,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that light gets converted</p>
<p>into electrical information.</p>
<p>Within the eye, within the retina,</p>
<p>there are then a series of stages of processing,</p>
<p>and that information eventually gets sent into the brain</p>
<p>by a very specific class of neurons.</p>
<p>I would like you to know the names of these neurons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called retinal ganglion cells.</p>
<p>So the only thing you need to know</p>
<p>about the neuroscience of the eye at this point</p>
<p>are that there are rods and cones.</p>
<p>The cones are involved in bright daytime vision,</p>
<p>and rods are involved in more dusk or nighttime vision,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got these cells called retinal ganglion cells</p>
<p>that send the information off to the rest of the brain.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I just want you to ponder this for a second.</p>
<p>This still blows my mind.</p>
<p>Everything you see around you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually seeing those objects directly.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re making a best guess</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s there based on the pattern of electricity</p>
<p>that arrives in your brain.</p>
<p>Now, that might just seem totally wild</p>
<p>and hard to wrap your head around,</p>
<p>but think about it this way,</p>
<p>because this is the way it actually works.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example of a color, like green or blue.</p>
<p>You have cones in your eye that respond best</p>
<p>to the wavelength of light</p>
<p>that is reflected off, say, a green apple.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually see the green apple.</p>
<p>What you see is the light bouncing off that green apple,</p>
<p>and it goes into your eye,</p>
<p>and you see it and perceive it as round and green,</p>
<p>but not because you see anything green.</p>
<p>No green light arrives in your brain.</p>
<p>What happens is your brain actually compares</p>
<p>the amount of green reflection coming off that apple</p>
<p>to the amount of red and blue around it.</p>
<p>Well, you might say, well,</p>
<p>the green apple is sitting on a brown table</p>
<p>or a white surface.</p>
<p>Well, then it will appear very green</p>
<p>because the amount of wavelength of light for green</p>
<p>is very high, and the amount for red is very low,</p>
<p>and so it looks very green, okay?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t actually see anything directly.</p>
<p>What the brain is receiving is a series of signals,</p>
<p>electrical signals, and it&rsquo;s comparing electrical signals</p>
<p>in order to come up with what we call these perceptions,</p>
<p>like I see something green, a green apple, or I see red.</p>
<p>Let me give you a slightly different example.</p>
<p>If you were to play a key on the piano,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you play, I&rsquo;m not a musician,</p>
<p>so hopefully I won&rsquo;t get this too incorrectly,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you have like E sharp,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s on ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</p>
<p>If the brain gets that signal, it doesn&rsquo;t actually know E.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, it doesn&rsquo;t recognize it</p>
<p>until you were to play another key next to it,</p>
<p>dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,</p>
<p>and what it does is it does the math,</p>
<p>it does the subtraction, and it compares those two.</p>
<p>So when we see something green, or we see something red,</p>
<p>or we see something blue,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not actually seeing it directly.</p>
<p>The brain is making a guess</p>
<p>about how green, or red, or blue that thing is</p>
<p>by comparing what&rsquo;s around it, okay?</p>
<p>And if that seems hard to wrap your head around, don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>because we will explain it in more depth going forward,</p>
<p>but I really want people to understand this,</p>
<p>that vision, eyesight, is not looking at things directly</p>
<p>and that information getting directly into your brain.</p>
<p>It is translated.</p>
<p>Light information is transformed into electrical signals</p>
<p>that your visual system exquisitely understands.</p>
<p>Now, what does this mean?</p>
<p>Why should you care about this?</p>
<p>Well, if you have a dog like I do, or a cat,</p>
<p>they are not colorblind,</p>
<p>but they lack the cones that respond to red,</p>
<p>meaning long wavelength light.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>That means that when they see green,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different than the green you see,</p>
<p>not because that apple isn&rsquo;t visible to them,</p>
<p>but because they aren&rsquo;t able to compare it to red,</p>
<p>and you are.</p>
<p>As a consequence, when they look at a green lawn,</p>
<p>it looks more brownish or orange to them.</p>
<p>When you wear a red shirt in front of your dog or cat,</p>
<p>if you see a stop sign and they see a stop sign,</p>
<p>they see orangish brown and you see red,</p>
<p>presuming that you are a trichromat,</p>
<p>meaning you have three color vision.</p>
<p>So this is all to say that every animal</p>
<p>sees the world differently,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not they have one or two</p>
<p>or three of these different cones,</p>
<p>the red, blue, or green cones.</p>
<p>If you are a mantis shrimp of all things,</p>
<p>you see hundreds of colors that human beings can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Many animals see into visual ranges</p>
<p>that you and I can&rsquo;t see in.</p>
<p>So for instance, a pit viper senses heat emissions.</p>
<p>It literally sees the heat coming off of you</p>
<p>or of an animal that they want to eat.</p>
<p>If you are a ground squirrel, you can see ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>This is going to sound kind of weird,</p>
<p>but ground squirrels actually signal one another</p>
<p>by standing up outside and shining sunlight</p>
<p>off each other&rsquo;s stomachs to each other,</p>
<p>signaling at a distance, just like, you know,</p>
<p>you could signal somebody with a mirror</p>
<p>and sunlight at distance.</p>
<p>There are species of primates,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t very pleasant to think about,</p>
<p>that urinate on their hands</p>
<p>and then wipe it all over their stomach</p>
<p>and then use that sunlight</p>
<p>to reflect different signals to each other.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>We always assume it&rsquo;s something cute and nice,</p>
<p>but maybe they&rsquo;re insulting each other.</p>
<p>So this actually gets right down to the heart</p>
<p>of these bigger questions like consciousness.</p>
<p>What do we see?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>How much of life is really accessible to us?</p>
<p>And I could go on and on.</p>
<p>You know, this used to be kind of an obsession of mine</p>
<p>when I was coming up in the field of visual neuroscience</p>
<p>to understand how different animals</p>
<p>see the world compared to us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give one more example, a diving bird,</p>
<p>you know, a bird that flies over the ocean.</p>
<p>It has an incredible task.</p>
<p>It has to both view the horizon</p>
<p>and it has to view schools of fish.</p>
<p>And then it has to make a trajectory down into the water</p>
<p>and grab one of those fish to eat.</p>
<p>And the water has what&rsquo;s called a refractory index.</p>
<p>It actually shifts like a prism,</p>
<p>the impression or the perception</p>
<p>of where that fish is, right?</p>
<p>If the bird sees the fish right below it,</p>
<p>it has to know, it has to adjust its diving trajectory</p>
<p>just right because it knows that that fish</p>
<p>actually isn&rsquo;t where it sees it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a few inches ahead or to the side of that</p>
<p>because of the way that water diverts the image.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever dropped a coin to the bottom of a pool,</p>
<p>if you go straight down looking at that location,</p>
<p>if you were to look from the top of the pool</p>
<p>and you dive straight down with your eyes closed,</p>
<p>you will miss because the water refracts,</p>
<p>it shifts the visual image.</p>
<p>Well, diving birds have an arrangement</p>
<p>of these retinal cells that communicate to the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s both a streak to view the horizon</p>
<p>because they need to know where they are</p>
<p>relative to the horizon.</p>
<p>And they have a pupil like we do on the bottom of their eye</p>
<p>so that they can make very accurate dive</p>
<p>and attacks on these schools of fish</p>
<p>and catch fish and eat those fish.</p>
<p>We just have pupils in the middle of our eyes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a ton about the optics of the eye</p>
<p>and the way that it communicates with the brain</p>
<p>that allows us to see.</p>
<p>We could spend hours talking about this,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;d like to embed in your mind</p>
<p>is that what you experience in the outside world</p>
<p>is bottlenecked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s limited by which wavelengths, which colors,</p>
<p>if you will, of light that you can see,</p>
<p>that your brain is coming up with a best guess</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually know what&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>and that your vision is distinctly different</p>
<p>from say the vision of a dog</p>
<p>or from the vision of somebody who&rsquo;s a dichromat,</p>
<p>meaning they don&rsquo;t have a red cone.</p>
<p>A lot of people in particular, about one in 80 males</p>
<p>lacks a red cone and therefore sees the world</p>
<p>much the same way that Costello does,</p>
<p>although he sees it from just much lower toward the ground.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like you to understand</p>
<p>about the way the eye communicates with the brain.</p>
<p>I would also like you to understand</p>
<p>that the brain itself is making these guesses</p>
<p>and that those guesses are largely right.</p>
<p>How do I know that?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re right because when you reach out</p>
<p>to grab a glass, most of the time you grab the glass</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t miss, right?</p>
<p>Most of the time when you make judgments</p>
<p>about the world around you</p>
<p>based on your visual impression of them,</p>
<p>it allows you to move functionally through the world.</p>
<p>But let me give you some examples</p>
<p>of where this guessing is happening right now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so incredible that to this day,</p>
<p>this still blows my mind.</p>
<p>Cover one eye with one hand.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re driving, maybe don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re viewing the world around you,</p>
<p>presumably you can see everything that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>I could do this with one eye or the other eye.</p>
<p>You probably see better out of one or the other</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>You have a giant blind spot</p>
<p>in the middle of your visual field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called your blind spot.</p>
<p>It is the spot in which the connections,</p>
<p>the wires from all those retinal ganglion cells</p>
<p>exit the back of the eye and head off toward the brain.</p>
<p>In other words, you are blind for a huge spot</p>
<p>of your central vision, the part of your vision</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s highest acuity, highest detail.</p>
<p>And yet you don&rsquo;t see that ever.</p>
<p>You cover one eye and you see perfectly fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just because your eye</p>
<p>is moving around really quickly.</p>
<p>Your brain is guessing what&rsquo;s in that spot,</p>
<p>which is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t see that blind spot.</p>
<p>This is happening all the time.</p>
<p>Now, when you have two eyes open,</p>
<p>the way that your eyes are positioned in your head</p>
<p>and the way they view the world is such</p>
<p>that they fill in each other&rsquo;s blind spot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty convenient.</p>
<p>But if you cover one eye, that&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>And yet you still see the world as complete.</p>
<p>So the brain is doing these incredible things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also creating depth, a sense of depth,</p>
<p>even though what arrives from the retina</p>
<p>is essentially a readout of a two-dimensional flat image.</p>
<p>So it can sense depth.</p>
<p>How do you know depth?</p>
<p>Well, this is very simple.</p>
<p>Things that are closer to you tend to be larger</p>
<p>than things that are far away.</p>
<p>Things that are closer to you tend to look</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re moving faster.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been in a train and you look to your side,</p>
<p>the rungs on a fence or the train tracks going by you</p>
<p>look like they&rsquo;re going very fast.</p>
<p>If you look off in the distance,</p>
<p>they look like they&rsquo;re moving very slowly.</p>
<p>And there are differences between what&rsquo;s close to you</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s further away.</p>
<p>So a little house on the horizon,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t look at it and say,</p>
<p>oh, that must be a tiny little house.</p>
<p>You have some prior knowledge</p>
<p>that things further away are smaller.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the main way that you do that.</p>
<p>And you compare the location</p>
<p>at which information about light lands on the two eyes.</p>
<p>So your eyes are slightly offset from one another.</p>
<p>So that, for instance, if I look at you,</p>
<p>if you were standing right in front of me right now</p>
<p>and I were to look at you, the image of your face,</p>
<p>the light bouncing off your face, to be more precise,</p>
<p>lands on one eye in a slightly different location</p>
<p>than it does in the other eye.</p>
<p>And then the brain does math.</p>
<p>It basically does the equivalent of geometry</p>
<p>and trigonometry and essentially figures out</p>
<p>how far away you are from me, which is just incredible.</p>
<p>So the brain does all this very, very fast.</p>
<p>And the brain uses about 40 to 50%</p>
<p>of its total real estate for vision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how important vision is.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are blind</p>
<p>or low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>that real estate in the brain will be taken over</p>
<p>by neurons that control a sense of touch</p>
<p>and a sense of hearing.</p>
<p>And indeed, hearing and touch are much better,</p>
<p>higher acuity and faster in blind people.</p>
<p>But for most of you who I presume are sighted,</p>
<p>this is how it works.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of vision from eye to brain in a nutshell.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of different stations in the brain</p>
<p>that do different things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s eyesight.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the other aspect of vision,</p>
<p>which is the stuff that you don&rsquo;t perceive,</p>
<p>the subconscious stuff.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll transition directly</p>
<p>into how you can use light and eyesight</p>
<p>to control this other stuff,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>And that other stuff is mood, sleep, and appetite.</p>
<p>And there are ways in which you can use</p>
<p>the same protocols that I will describe</p>
<p>in order to preserve and even enhance your vision,</p>
<p>your ability to see things and consciously perceive them.</p>
<p>So the protocols we will describe</p>
<p>have a lot of carry over to both conscious eyesight</p>
<p>and to these subconscious aspects of vision.</p>
<p>And I just want you to understand a little bit more</p>
<p>about the science of seeing, of eyesight and vision,</p>
<p>and then all the protocols will make perfect sense.</p>
<p>So as amazing as eyesight is,</p>
<p>it actually did not evolve for us to see shapes</p>
<p>and colors and motion and form.</p>
<p>The most ancient cells in our eyes</p>
<p>and the reason we have eyes</p>
<p>is to communicate information about time of day</p>
<p>to the rest of the brain and body.</p>
<p>Remember, there&rsquo;s no extraocular photoreception.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way for light information</p>
<p>to get to all the cells of your body,</p>
<p>but every cell in your body needs to know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s night or day.</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about this in the episodes on sleep.</p>
<p>And this episode is not about sleep,</p>
<p>but I want to emphasize that there is a particular category</p>
<p>of retinal ganglion cell.</p>
<p>Remember the neurons that connect the retina to the brain</p>
<p>that is involved in a special kind of vision</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with conscious perception</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s around you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening all the time.</p>
<p>These are so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells</p>
<p>named after the opsin that they contain within them.</p>
<p>They are essentially photoreceptors.</p>
<p>Remember before I said there are photoreceptors</p>
<p>and then these ganglion cells?</p>
<p>Well, these melanopsin cells, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>melanopsin have their own photoreceptor built inside them.</p>
<p>The opsin that they contain is actually very similar</p>
<p>to the melanopsin that is present in the skin</p>
<p>of some amphibians and that causes those amphibians</p>
<p>to change their skin color in different light conditions.</p>
<p>So you have, believe it or not,</p>
<p>a little bit of frog skin in your eye, so to speak.</p>
<p>Okay, not exactly, but you essentially have the equivalent</p>
<p>of what frogs have in their skin in your eye.</p>
<p>If you are low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>as long as you have retinas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely you still have these cells</p>
<p>even though you can&rsquo;t see or you don&rsquo;t see well.</p>
<p>These cells, retinal ganglion cells,</p>
<p>communicate to areas of the brain</p>
<p>when particular qualities of light</p>
<p>are present in your environment</p>
<p>and signal to the brain, therefore,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s early day or late in the day.</p>
<p>These melanopsin ganglion cells</p>
<p>are sometimes also called intrinsically photosensitive cells</p>
<p>because they behave like photoreceptors.</p>
<p>What do these cells respond to</p>
<p>and why should you care about them?</p>
<p>Well, you should care about them</p>
<p>because they regulate when you&rsquo;ll get sleepy,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ll feel awake,</p>
<p>how fast your metabolism is, excuse me,</p>
<p>your blood sugar levels, your dopamine levels,</p>
<p>and your pain threshold.</p>
<p>There are other factors that impact those things,</p>
<p>but they are one of the, if not the most powerful determinant</p>
<p>of those other things like mood and pain threshold,</p>
<p>sleepiness, wakefulness, et cetera.</p>
<p>These melanopsin ganglion cells have been shown</p>
<p>by the NITES group, N-E-I-T-E-S,</p>
<p>up at the University of Washington</p>
<p>and by Samer Hattar&rsquo;s lab and David Bersin&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>and a number of other people&rsquo;s labs,</p>
<p>such in Panda, Iggy Provencio, et cetera,</p>
<p>a number of excellent labs in neuroscience</p>
<p>to set the circadian clock and to respond best</p>
<p>to the contrast between blue and yellow light</p>
<p>of the sort that lands on these cells</p>
<p>when you view the sun,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s at so-called low solar angle,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s low in the sky,</p>
<p>either in the morning or in the evening.</p>
<p>What does all this mean?</p>
<p>It means, and here&rsquo;s the first protocol,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve probably heard me say this before,</p>
<p>but it is appropriate to this episode to say it again.</p>
<p>If you are not viewing the sun, sunlight,</p>
<p>even through cloud cover for two to 10 minutes</p>
<p>in the early part of the day</p>
<p>when the sun is still low in the sky</p>
<p>and doing the same thing again in the evening,</p>
<p>you are severely disrupting your sleep rhythms,</p>
<p>your mood, your hormones, your metabolism,</p>
<p>your pain threshold, and many other factors,</p>
<p>including your ability to learn and remember information.</p>
<p>The most central and important aspect of our biology</p>
<p>and perhaps our psychology as well</p>
<p>is to anchor ourselves in time,</p>
<p>to know when we exist, okay?</p>
<p>It sounds a little bit abstract and philosophical,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know time as a real thing</p>
<p>because of watches and clocks.</p>
<p>We know time at a biological level</p>
<p>based on where the sun is and where,</p>
<p>which of course is where we are relative to the sun</p>
<p>because the earth is spinning around.</p>
<p>Now, what does this mean for a protocol?</p>
<p>It means see, get that light in your eyes early in the day</p>
<p>and anytime you want to be awake.</p>
<p>So try and get as much sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>during the day as you safely can.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about eye safety this episode in depth.</p>
<p>And the blue light and the contrast of that blue yellow,</p>
<p>remember, we don&rsquo;t see blue.</p>
<p>This is all subconscious.</p>
<p>This is blue reflections coming off of sunlight.</p>
<p>Blue light, we&rsquo;ve been told is so terrible for us.</p>
<p>It is absolutely essential and wonderful</p>
<p>for waking up the brain,</p>
<p>for triggering all sorts of positive biological reactions,</p>
<p>but it needs to be viewed early in the day.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t see sunlight</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the thick cloud cover of say in a,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re in the UK and it&rsquo;s winter,</p>
<p>then artificial lights,</p>
<p>especially blue lights would be very beneficial to you.</p>
<p>You need a lot of this light and its contrast with yellow</p>
<p>in order to trigger these melanopsin cells,</p>
<p>which would then trigger your circadian clock,</p>
<p>which sits above the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>which will signal every cell in your body,</p>
<p>including temperature rhythms, et cetera.</p>
<p>So first things first,</p>
<p>your visual system was not for seeing faces, motion,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>The most ancient cells in your eye,</p>
<p>which are there right now as we speak,</p>
<p>are there to inform your body and brain about time of day.</p>
<p>So you want to get that bright light early in the day.</p>
<p>Absolutely essential, two to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>You can download the light meter app</p>
<p>if you want to measure lux.</p>
<p>When I explained how to do that in earlier episodes,</p>
<p>it got a little convoluted.</p>
<p>Get that two to 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s another reason to do this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never spoken about this before on any podcast,</p>
<p>which is that there have been several studies now</p>
<p>in thousands of subjects exploring what can be done</p>
<p>to prevent myopia, nearsightedness, and other visual defects.</p>
<p>And it turns out in a series of large clinical trials,</p>
<p>the conclusion has emerged that getting two hours a day</p>
<p>of outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light,</p>
<p>this blue light that everyone has demonized,</p>
<p>getting that sunlight during the day for two hours,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re reading other things</p>
<p>and doing other things outside,</p>
<p>has a significant effect on reducing the probability</p>
<p>that you will get myopia, nearsightedness.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not that&rsquo;s also due to the fact</p>
<p>that myopia can be caused by viewing things</p>
<p>up close too much.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re indoors,</p>
<p>we tend to be looking at things more closely, right?</p>
<p>Unless you have a very large house</p>
<p>with walls that are very far away from you.</p>
<p>But the effect does seem to be directly related</p>
<p>to getting sunlight and not just to the distance</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re viewing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to describe this study just briefly,</p>
<p>but this is a second protocol.</p>
<p>So we have one protocol about getting sunlight</p>
<p>to set your circadian clocks, meaning wake you up,</p>
<p>establish your sleep,</p>
<p>will occur about 12 to 16 hours later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all in the sleep episode,</p>
<p>but also to enhance your mood, to enhance your metabolism,</p>
<p>to optimize your hormone levels,</p>
<p>and to optimize learning and dopamine levels,</p>
<p>this feel good neuromodulator that&rsquo;s essential</p>
<p>to not getting depressed, et cetera.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s a second protocol, which is ideally,</p>
<p>and this includes children,</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re not very small infants,</p>
<p>ideally, we&rsquo;re all getting two hours of outdoor time,</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s cloud cover.</p>
<p>Remember, we evolved mostly under outdoor conditions,</p>
<p>not indoor conditions.</p>
<p>And no artificial blue light will not replace this aspect</p>
<p>of your visual system and offsetting myopia.</p>
<p>So I just want to briefly describe this study</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very important one,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s discussed often enough.</p>
<p>There are many studies exploring this,</p>
<p>but one of the ones I like the most looked at 693 students,</p>
<p>and a subset of them were encouraged</p>
<p>to spend 11 hours a week outdoors, okay?</p>
<p>So most kids are in school five days a week or so.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re spending 11 hours a week outdoors.</p>
<p>They are sometimes reading outdoors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not always just playing outdoors.</p>
<p>They might be reading books, et cetera.</p>
<p>They used eight different schools.</p>
<p>And the reason they did this study,</p>
<p>I probably should have mentioned,</p>
<p>is that myopia, nearsightedness, is a global epidemic.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s how it was referred to in the study.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who decides what&rsquo;s an epidemic or not.</p>
<p>I think there are thresholds for that.</p>
<p>This paper published in the journal,</p>
<p>Ophthalmology in 2018,</p>
<p>described the fact that being outdoors for two hours a day</p>
<p>could significantly reduce the probability</p>
<p>that these children would develop nearsightedness.</p>
<p>And it turns out, based on other studies,</p>
<p>that adults who spend two hours a day outside,</p>
<p>so that would be reading outside, talking outside,</p>
<p>no, it does not include light</p>
<p>coming through the windshield of your car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain why in a few moments.</p>
<p>Offset the formation of myopia.</p>
<p>Now, myopia or nearsightedness has to do</p>
<p>with the way that the lens focuses light onto the retina.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into a long description of this now,</p>
<p>but basically the lens has to bring light to the retina,</p>
<p>not in front of it, not behind it.</p>
<p>If it brings light to a position in front of the retina,</p>
<p>then you won&rsquo;t see clearly.</p>
<p>You will need corrective lenses.</p>
<p>If it brings light directly to the retina,</p>
<p>then you will see clearly.</p>
<p>That should be intuitive why that makes sense.</p>
<p>So you might say, why would being outside,</p>
<p>getting this blue light or this blue-yellow contrast</p>
<p>from sunlight actually offset myopia?</p>
<p>Well, it probably, and I want to emphasize probably,</p>
<p>has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that these melanopsin ganglion cells,</p>
<p>these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells</p>
<p>are not just responsible for sleep</p>
<p>and talking to your circadian clock and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>They also make connections within the retina.</p>
<p>They connect to things like, this is for the aficionados,</p>
<p>the ciliary body, the iris, the muscles,</p>
<p>and the structures within the eye</p>
<p>that actually move the lens</p>
<p>and allow you to adjust your vision</p>
<p>to things up close or far away.</p>
<p>And in doing so, they increase or improve the health</p>
<p>of the little tiny muscles within the eye</p>
<p>that move the lens.</p>
<p>And they probably, again,</p>
<p>this needs a little bit more work</p>
<p>in order to really tamp down the mechanism.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably also involved in bringing growth factors</p>
<p>and blood supply to the muscles and to the neurons</p>
<p>that are responsible</p>
<p>for this focusing mechanism within the eye.</p>
<p>So remember, your eye is an optical device.</p>
<p>You were born with lenses.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to use glasses, or maybe you do,</p>
<p>because you have lenses in your eyes.</p>
<p>And those lenses need to move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a rigid lens like a glass lens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic lens.</p>
<p>It has little muscles that pull on it and squeeze it.</p>
<p>And make it thicker or thinner</p>
<p>as you look at things close and far away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll describe how that works in a moment.</p>
<p>These melanopsin cells and their activation by sunlight,</p>
<p>completely subconsciously, you&rsquo;re unaware of this,</p>
<p>promote the health of this system within the eye</p>
<p>and allow you to offset the myopia, nearsightedness.</p>
<p>In other words, getting outside for two hours a day,</p>
<p>each day, on average, even if there&rsquo;s cloud cover,</p>
<p>without sunglasses on,</p>
<p>will allow you to offset the formation of myopia.</p>
<p>Now, you might still form myopia</p>
<p>if you have certain structural features</p>
<p>or genetic basis for that.</p>
<p>We will talk about things that you can do as well.</p>
<p>But for everybody, we should be doing this.</p>
<p>And that might seem like a lot,</p>
<p>but this is the way that your visual system works.</p>
<p>Staying indoors, just getting artificial light,</p>
<p>and looking at things up close,</p>
<p>leads to visual defects, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of kind of like visual obesity, right?</p>
<p>The posture of your visual system, if you will,</p>
<p>is going to be unhealthy if you&rsquo;re just indoors</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting sunlight early in the day</p>
<p>and for at least two hours per day.</p>
<p>I want to talk a little bit more about how our eyes adjust</p>
<p>to things that are close to us or far away.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely brilliant consequence</p>
<p>of our nature and our design.</p>
<p>And whenever I say nature and design,</p>
<p>people always ask me, you know,</p>
<p>what are you really trying to say?</p>
<p>Are you trying to talk about creators?</p>
<p>Are you talking about intelligent design?</p>
<p>Look, I want to be very frank with you.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase and neither were you.</p>
<p>And so that is all very interesting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the topic of this discussion.</p>
<p>What is clear and what is the topic of this discussion</p>
<p>is that the eye can dynamically adjust where light lands</p>
<p>by moving the lens and changing the shape of the lens</p>
<p>in your eye through a process called accommodation.</p>
<p>And if you understand this process of accommodation,</p>
<p>you not only can enhance the health of your eyes</p>
<p>in the immediate and long-term, but you also can work better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to focus better on physical and mental work.</p>
<p>You will be able to concentrate for longer.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that so much of our mental focus,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s for cognitive endeavors</p>
<p>or physical endeavors,</p>
<p>is grounded in where we place our visual focus.</p>
<p>Okay, what we look at and our ability</p>
<p>to hold our concentration there</p>
<p>is critically determining how we think.</p>
<p>So in other words, if you can hold visual focus,</p>
<p>you can hold mental focus, cognitive focus,</p>
<p>but holding visual focus is challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tiring because it requires movement of the lens.</p>
<p>And that movement of the lens requires activation</p>
<p>of muscles and the activation of muscles,</p>
<p>as you know, from the physical performance episodes,</p>
<p>if you saw them, and even if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>is dictated by neurons.</p>
<p>So what is accommodation?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually very simple and very elegant.</p>
<p>And again, this is another case</p>
<p>where whenever I look at this stuff,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;ve been looking at it for years,</p>
<p>learning about it for years,</p>
<p>it still boggles my mind that we have these apparati</p>
<p>built into our eyes.</p>
<p>So we have lenses in our eyes</p>
<p>and we have these things called the irises.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all familiar with the iris</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll see people&rsquo;s pupils get bigger or smaller.</p>
<p>And we intuitively think of eyes as having the pupils.</p>
<p>If you actually draw two circles on a sheet of paper</p>
<p>and they look like two circles,</p>
<p>but if you put little dots in the middle of them,</p>
<p>they look like eyes.</p>
<p>Your brain recognizes those as eyes</p>
<p>because one of the first things you see</p>
<p>when you come into this world are eyes.</p>
<p>And actually, if you put the little dots close together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll look kind of wrong, like it&rsquo;s cross-eyed.</p>
<p>And if you put them at different locations</p>
<p>within those two dots, opposing locations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll look Google-eyed.</p>
<p>And so your brain is actually filling in all the face</p>
<p>and other information, even emotional information,</p>
<p>just based on this recognition of eyes.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s clearly, we know this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s real estate deep up, further up in the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for analyzing and recognizing faces.</p>
<p>And the eyes and the position of these little things</p>
<p>we call irises and pupils, et cetera,</p>
<p>is really important for how we interpret</p>
<p>the status of others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a powerful thing</p>
<p>just to put two circles and move the pupils around on paper.</p>
<p>In fact, I want to get into a combination,</p>
<p>but if you think about it,</p>
<p>if one of my pupils was up there</p>
<p>and the other one was down there,</p>
<p>one was really big and one was really small,</p>
<p>that would actually be a sign of pretty severe damage.</p>
<p>If someone gets hit hard on the side of the head,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that they shine a light in one eye.</p>
<p>You know what they&rsquo;re doing that?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually looking at the other eye.</p>
<p>When you shine light of the eye,</p>
<p>that pupil constricts to limit the amount of light</p>
<p>that comes in so it doesn&rsquo;t damage the eye.</p>
<p>This also happens when you walk outside and it&rsquo;s bright.</p>
<p>It constricts, but we have what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the consensual pupil reflex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a connection deep in the brainstem,</p>
<p>deep back here in the brain near my neck</p>
<p>that connects the pupil mechanism for the two eyes.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re looking at the other eye.</p>
<p>And if you shine light in one eye</p>
<p>and that pupil constricts, but the other one doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good chance there&rsquo;s brainstem damage.</p>
<p>This is what they do on the side of a football field</p>
<p>or a boxing match, or if someone,</p>
<p>unfortunately, hits their head.</p>
<p>So two pupils, and don&rsquo;t freak out</p>
<p>if one pupil is a little bit smaller than the other,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean brain damage.</p>
<p>But if you suddenly have one pupil bigger than the other,</p>
<p>you absolutely want to go see a neurologist right away.</p>
<p>So the eyes and the pupils are indicative</p>
<p>of things that are happening deep in the brain.</p>
<p>Now, accommodation is our ability to accommodate</p>
<p>to things that are up close here or further away.</p>
<p>And the way this works is that the iris</p>
<p>and the musculature in a structure</p>
<p>called the ciliary body move the lens.</p>
<p>So when you look far away, okay,</p>
<p>when you see things far away,</p>
<p>your lens actually relaxes, it can flatten out.</p>
<p>So I want you to think about this.</p>
<p>When you look far away, when it may be anywhere</p>
<p>from like 20 feet away from you out to a horizon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s miles or kilometers away from you,</p>
<p>the lens can just relax, it can flatten out.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice that it actually is relaxing</p>
<p>to look at a horizon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s relaxing to look far away.</p>
<p>Whereas if I look at something up close to me,</p>
<p>like this pen or my phone or a computer screen</p>
<p>or this microphone, it takes effort.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll sense the effort.</p>
<p>Now, some of that effort is actually eye movements</p>
<p>because you have muscles that can move your eyes</p>
<p>within their sockets.</p>
<p>But a lot of the work, quote unquote, is neural work</p>
<p>of the muscles having to move and contract</p>
<p>such that the lens actually gets thicker</p>
<p>in order to bring the light to the retina</p>
<p>and not to a location in front of it or behind it,</p>
<p>so-called accommodation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also changes in the size of the pupil</p>
<p>as things are closer and further away from you.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a simple way to think about this.</p>
<p>Healthy pupils are going to dilate</p>
<p>when you look at something far away from you.</p>
<p>Now, when you see something that excites you</p>
<p>or stresses you out, your pupils also get big.</p>
<p>Your eyes get wide.</p>
<p>But if you look at something far away,</p>
<p>your pupils are going to dilate.</p>
<p>And when you look at things that are closer to you,</p>
<p>when you move them up close,</p>
<p>the pupils are going to shrink.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all part of this accommodation mechanism.</p>
<p>Now, you might say,</p>
<p>why are you telling me about accommodation?</p>
<p>This is crazy.</p>
<p>Why are you telling me about this?</p>
<p>Well, these days we&rsquo;re spending a lot of time</p>
<p>looking at things, mainly our phones up close</p>
<p>and computers up close, and we are indoors.</p>
<p>If you are a young person,</p>
<p>and even if you are 25 or older,</p>
<p>and you are spending a lot of time</p>
<p>looking at things up close,</p>
<p>and you are not allowing your vision to relax,</p>
<p>in other words, you are not giving your lens</p>
<p>the opportunity to flatten out</p>
<p>and for these muscles to relieve themselves of this work,</p>
<p>you may or may not have migraine headaches.</p>
<p>You may or may not have headaches.</p>
<p>You might, and that could be the cause of those.</p>
<p>But you are also training your eyes</p>
<p>to be good at looking at things up close and not far away,</p>
<p>and as a consequence,</p>
<p>you are reshaping the neural circuitry in your brain,</p>
<p>and it is not good, it is not healthy</p>
<p>to only look at things up close.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of recommendations out there right now,</p>
<p>especially with all the lockdowns of the last 12 to 18 months</p>
<p>that people should look up from Zoom every once in a while,</p>
<p>or maybe now I&rsquo;m hearing that people should take calls</p>
<p>instead of doing Zoom,</p>
<p>or you should look up from your computer screen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not going to solve the problem</p>
<p>just to look up from your computer screen.</p>
<p>You need to go to a window,</p>
<p>you need to look out at a distance.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would even open the window</p>
<p>because those windows actually filter out</p>
<p>a lot of the blue light that you want during the daytime,</p>
<p>a lot of the sunlight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually 50 times less gets through.</p>
<p>You want to get out onto a balcony.</p>
<p>You want to relax your eyes and look out at the horizon.</p>
<p>You want to go into what&rsquo;s called panoramic vision</p>
<p>and let your vision expand.</p>
<p>You want this lens mechanism to be very elastic.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want it to get stuck in that configuration</p>
<p>of looking at things up close.</p>
<p>Accommodation is a wonderful feature of your visual system,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to push that too hard,</p>
<p>too often, or for too long.</p>
<p>You want to view the horizon.</p>
<p>You want to get outside,</p>
<p>not just to lighten the load on your mind</p>
<p>or to think about other things,</p>
<p>but to maintain the health of your visual system.</p>
<p>In other words, you want to exercise these muscles,</p>
<p>and that involves both the lens moving</p>
<p>and getting kind of thicker and relaxing that lens.</p>
<p>And the relaxation of the lens</p>
<p>is actually one of the best things you can do</p>
<p>for the musculature of the inner eye.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the protocol?</p>
<p>How often should you do this?</p>
<p>You might be surprised,</p>
<p>but for every 30 minutes of focused work,</p>
<p>you probably want to look up every once in a while</p>
<p>and just try and relax your face and eye muscles,</p>
<p>including your jaw muscles,</p>
<p>because all these things are closely linked</p>
<p>in the brainstem,</p>
<p>and allow your eyes to go into a so-called panoramic vision</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just not really focusing on anything,</p>
<p>and then refocus on your work.</p>
<p>At least every 90 minutes of looking at things up close,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;re looking at a screen,</p>
<p>a television screen, or you&rsquo;re watching a movie,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re indoors,</p>
<p>for every 90 minutes of that,</p>
<p>you ideally would have at least 20,</p>
<p>probably more like 30 minutes of being outside,</p>
<p>ideally, but if you can&rsquo;t be outside,</p>
<p>of non-up-close vision.</p>
<p>Now, you might say, that&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to do that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in an office or I&rsquo;m in a building.</p>
<p>Get to a window, get outside if you can do it safely,</p>
<p>get onto a balcony, and just let your eyes relax.</p>
<p>Many people are experiencing severe vision problems</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not getting enough sunlight during the day.</p>
<p>They have sleep problems</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not viewing sunlight early in the day.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in previous episodes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting a lot of artificial stimulation,</p>
<p>artificial light stimulation of the eye</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>All of this is through the visual system.</p>
<p>So migraines, fatigue,</p>
<p>challenges with your eyesight getting worse as you age,</p>
<p>or even in young people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s at least according to the articles,</p>
<p>they describe it as this epidemic of myopia,</p>
<p>can largely be dealt with by getting outside,</p>
<p>going into panoramic vision,</p>
<p>experiencing some distanced vision,</p>
<p>look at things off on the horizon.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re walking or hiking or biking,</p>
<p>not looking at your phone the whole time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at the bus stop or you&rsquo;re commuting,</p>
<p>certainly not looking at your phone</p>
<p>the entire time you&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>So this is vital.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize another protocol,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t want to get into it in too much depth</p>
<p>because I want to make sure that I also talk about</p>
<p>a number of other important aspects of the visual system</p>
<p>that are more related to sight.</p>
<p>But getting into optic flow</p>
<p>is very important for de-stressing your system.</p>
<p>When you move through space,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s through walking, biking, even swimming,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s self-generated optic flow,</p>
<p>so probably not driving or motorcycling,</p>
<p>but yes, bicycling or, I don&rsquo;t know, unicycling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I thought about unicycling.</p>
<p>There used to be a graduate student at Stanford</p>
<p>who was a really impressive unicycler.</p>
<p>Those are pretty rare.</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s self-generated optic flow,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re generating motion of your body</p>
<p>and the visual images around you are passing by</p>
<p>on your eyes, that is very good for the visual system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very good for the mood systems</p>
<p>and the neuromodulator systems of the brain and body</p>
<p>that regulate mood.</p>
<p>This is well-established.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not telling people to get away</p>
<p>from their phone and their computers.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time staring at a page,</p>
<p>drawing, writing, texting, et cetera, just like you do.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re really talking about some very simple protocols</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t just designed to improve your sleep,</p>
<p>but are really designed to bolster and enhance your vision.</p>
<p>And of course, because it&rsquo;s this podcast,</p>
<p>we will also talk about things that you can take</p>
<p>to improve your vision.</p>
<p>But if your visual behavior isn&rsquo;t right,</p>
<p>and I do believe we should always start with behaviors</p>
<p>and then think about nutrition, supplementation, et cetera.</p>
<p>If your behaviors around vision aren&rsquo;t right,</p>
<p>you cannot expect to have good healthy eyesight</p>
<p>for a long time, meaning throughout your lifespan.</p>
<p>And if your vision is already poor,</p>
<p>many of these things that I&rsquo;m talking about today,</p>
<p>perhaps all of them will improve your vision to some degree.</p>
<p>And if your vision is starting to go,</p>
<p>then doing these behaviors is likely to really enhance</p>
<p>the quality of the vision that you will build</p>
<p>and maintain over time.</p>
<p>And all of these are essentially zero cost, okay?</p>
<p>If you live in a very dark environment,</p>
<p>like a cave or outer space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be hard to do some of this stuff.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re on planet earth, even if there&rsquo;s cloud cover,</p>
<p>chances are you can do some or most,</p>
<p>or even all of these, some, most, or all days.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to describe next is going to seem so silly</p>
<p>on the face of it, but has deep mechanism to support it.</p>
<p>Put simply, when you get tired, your eyelids close.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re alert, your eyelids are open.</p>
<p>That is because you have neurons in your brain</p>
<p>that depending on your level of alertness</p>
<p>will make it easy or hard to keep your eyes open.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a complete duh,</p>
<p>except that we don&rsquo;t often think about the relationship</p>
<p>between alertness and where we are looking and our eyelids.</p>
<p>Now, I learned this from a colleague of mine in psychiatry</p>
<p>who happens to work on hypnosis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to hypnotize you right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually for a future episode.</p>
<p>But what happens when we get tired?</p>
<p>Our eyelids close and our chin moves down.</p>
<p>We tend to nod out this way.</p>
<p>If you have ever been in a classroom,</p>
<p>certainly not one of mine,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve been in a classroom</p>
<p>and the lecture is kind of drawing on,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the afternoon,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is that a number of students,</p>
<p>their eyelids are closing and their chin is dropping,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll see a bunch of heads bouncing back up.</p>
<p>I was definitely one of those people in class.</p>
<p>If it was post-lunch in the afternoon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s warm, the hum of the air conditioner,</p>
<p>whatever it is, and I just out.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re wide awake, the opposite happens.</p>
<p>Our eyelids are open all the way</p>
<p>and our chin happens to be up.</p>
<p>And no, this is not me telling you to have good posture.</p>
<p>However, what I learned from my colleague at Stanford</p>
<p>is that these circuits actually act in loops.</p>
<p>When we look up,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s because these melanopsin cells</p>
<p>are in the bottom of our retina, they are,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>in order to view sunlight, which is overhead, which it is,</p>
<p>but that system of alertness</p>
<p>is linked to the position of our eyes.</p>
<p>So when we look up and our eyelids are up,</p>
<p>it actually has a purpose.</p>
<p>It actually creates a wakefulness signal for the brain.</p>
<p>And so while this might seem like the silliest</p>
<p>and simple tool that I might ever describe on this podcast,</p>
<p>if you are feeling tired,</p>
<p>it actually can be beneficial</p>
<p>to the wakefulness systems of the brain,</p>
<p>including the locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and these areas that release norepinephrine,</p>
<p>to actually look up, to actually look up toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your chin all the way back,</p>
<p>but to look up and to raise your eyes toward the ceiling</p>
<p>and to look up and try and hold that for 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t looking up and closing your eyes</p>
<p>like on a nice sunny day, that&rsquo;s relaxing.</p>
<p>This is looking up and actually looking up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>It actually triggers some of the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in wakefulness.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s falling asleep at your work,</p>
<p>this can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Likewise, many people are looking at their phone all day</p>
<p>and their chin is down,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re sitting at a computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s positioned below them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re having trouble staying awake or focusing.</p>
<p>It can be very bad.</p>
<p>I tell Costello this all the time</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s always falling asleep</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s trying to do his work.</p>
<p>Positioning your computer screen up at eye level</p>
<p>or sometimes having it actually above eye level</p>
<p>can actually create wakefulness and alertness</p>
<p>for the work that you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>This is simply because of this connection</p>
<p>between the brainstem circuits</p>
<p>and the other neural circuits that control wakefulness</p>
<p>and eyelids opening and looking up, okay?</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s remarkably simple, almost laughably simple,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s grounded in some of the most hardwired,</p>
<p>meaning present from birth aspects of our neural circuitry.</p>
<p>And norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just a mouthful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really interesting and powerful mechanism</p>
<p>for how the rest of the brain wakes up.</p>
<p>Locus coeruleus hoses the rest of your brain</p>
<p>with norepinephrine in order to wake up those circuits</p>
<p>for work and attention.</p>
<p>And so eyes up is actually a way,</p>
<p>a route into increased alertness.</p>
<p>Eyes down is a route into sleepiness,</p>
<p>into reduced alertness.</p>
<p>And I have only one friend that texts up here,</p>
<p>like on the street, holds his phone up here.</p>
<p>It looks ridiculous.</p>
<p>And yet, if we were trying to create</p>
<p>more sense of alertness, if that&rsquo;s your goal,</p>
<p>positioning computer screens up high, chin up,</p>
<p>looking up if you need to kind of create</p>
<p>an alertness signal,</p>
<p>not always being chinned down and texting</p>
<p>or working into typewriters or reading below us</p>
<p>is actually going to send a recurring wakefulness signal.</p>
<p>When things are up, we tend to be alert.</p>
<p>When everything&rsquo;s focused down, including our eyes,</p>
<p>it tends to have a more suppressive or sedative type</p>
<p>signaling to the deeper centers of the brain.</p>
<p>Now, before we move on to the science and tools</p>
<p>and protocols related to pattern vision,</p>
<p>I want to mention another study that was done</p>
<p>by the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>They have a terrific group there that works on sleep.</p>
<p>They made an important discovery</p>
<p>that I think everybody should know about,</p>
<p>which is that children that sleep in rooms</p>
<p>that have a nightlight or dim lights</p>
<p>are much more likely to develop myopia, nearsightedness.</p>
<p>Conversely, children that sleep in very dark rooms,</p>
<p>so either very dim nightlights or complete black,</p>
<p>they have a much lower, statistically speaking,</p>
<p>a significantly lower probability</p>
<p>of developing myopia, nearsightedness.</p>
<p>Now, why is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the wavelengths of light that matter</p>
<p>for these melanopsin cells</p>
<p>oftentimes can get through the eyelids.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s particularly true for children</p>
<p>and people that have thin eyelids.</p>
<p>Some people, like me, have very thin eyelids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told this before.</p>
<p>Not many people touch my eyelids,</p>
<p>but among those that have that very thin eyelids,</p>
<p>I notice I have very thin eyelids compared to, say, Costello.</p>
<p>Now, Costello&rsquo;s eyes droop.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t even close his eyes all the way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so droopy.</p>
<p>But many people have thin eyelids,</p>
<p>and those people are going to be even more prone</p>
<p>to light coming in through the eyelid.</p>
<p>So for parents, for kids, and for adults,</p>
<p>you really want to try to get to a place</p>
<p>where you can sleep in a completely</p>
<p>black or dark environment.</p>
<p>One little exposure to light, no big deal,</p>
<p>but this ties back to the other protocol</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve described before in the mood and sleep episodes,</p>
<p>which is that viewing light,</p>
<p>even a very low intensity between the hours</p>
<p>of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. is extremely detrimental</p>
<p>to the dopamine and other mood-producing systems</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>It can negatively impact learning and immunity</p>
<p>and even blood sugar and make people type 2 diabetes prone</p>
<p>by way of communication from these melanopsin cells</p>
<p>to a structure in the brain called the habenula.</p>
<p>Why am I throwing out all this verbiage?</p>
<p>Well, because people have asked for more mechanisms.</p>
<p>So if you really want to know, when you look at blue light,</p>
<p>or if blue light is getting in through your eyelids</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>it is likely distorting these lens accommodation mechanism</p>
<p>in the eye and leading to myopia in some cases.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one reason to avoid blue light exposure</p>
<p>and bright light exposure,</p>
<p>even nightlight exposure in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Viewing any light of bright intensity</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>on a consistent basis is going to suppress dopamine</p>
<p>because of the way that that light activates</p>
<p>these melanopsin cells and the habenula</p>
<p>and the dopamine system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all very simple.</p>
<p>Get as much bright light as you can safely, right?</p>
<p>You never want to look at any light so bright</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s painful to look at during the daytime.</p>
<p>Try and go without sunglasses unless you need them.</p>
<p>Now, I wear sunglasses for sake of sport</p>
<p>and sake of when it&rsquo;s really bright out,</p>
<p>but I try to get two hours a day of working outside</p>
<p>or being outside, even if there&rsquo;s cloud cover,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to offset myopia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to help you get better sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to support mood and metabolism, et cetera.</p>
<p>And at night, if you&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>with a lot of lights in the room,</p>
<p>and especially if there are kids that need a nightlight,</p>
<p>you should try and wean them off that nightlight</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to be beneficial for their vision</p>
<p>to wean them off that nightlight</p>
<p>and put them into a darker environment.</p>
<p>Obviously, you want to get them emotionally comfortable</p>
<p>with that first.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about pattern vision,</p>
<p>actual seeing things like faces and colors, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m presuming that some of you out there are colorblind.</p>
<p>We can all help the red-green colorblind folks out there.</p>
<p>By not using red in slides and diagrams</p>
<p>and on menus and things of that sort,</p>
<p>try and use magenta instead.</p>
<p>They can see the contrast between magenta and green better</p>
<p>than if there&rsquo;s red and green.</p>
<p>So be kind to the colorblind folks out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a fair percentage.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of different kinds of colorblind.</p>
<p>I should just mention some people are true monochromats.</p>
<p>They see the world in black and white.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>Most colorblind people, colorblind in quotes,</p>
<p>are red-green colorblind,</p>
<p>meaning they lack red cone photopigment,</p>
<p>meaning they can&rsquo;t see long wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>So they see the world much as a canine or a cat does</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t get the green-red contrast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we call it red-green colorblind.</p>
<p>They have the green cones,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t do the contrast comparison</p>
<p>that I described at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>So use magenta and they will be able to see things.</p>
<p>You wonder why stop signs and stoplights</p>
<p>and things aren&rsquo;t in magenta.</p>
<p>Well, because the world is unkind</p>
<p>to the red-green colorblind individuals</p>
<p>and they have to learn the position</p>
<p>of those lights in the streetlights</p>
<p>and they have to learn the shapes of signs,</p>
<p>which they can do readily.</p>
<p>And it usually says stop on it as well.</p>
<p>But if you care about colorblind folks, which I do,</p>
<p>then we could all do them a service by,</p>
<p>I think by law actually in the US,</p>
<p>menus are required to be colorblind accessible.</p>
<p>How can you improve your vision?</p>
<p>How can you get better at seeing things?</p>
<p>Well, one way is to make sure that you spend</p>
<p>at least 10 minutes a day total, at least,</p>
<p>viewing things off in the distance.</p>
<p>So that would be well over half a mile or more.</p>
<p>Try and see a horizon,</p>
<p>try and get your vision out to a location</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beyond the four walls of your house or apartment</p>
<p>or the doors of your car and the windshield of your car.</p>
<p>I know that can be hard to do, but it&rsquo;s very valuable.</p>
<p>If you live in a city like New York</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s skyscrapers everywhere,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve probably experienced the incredible</p>
<p>sense of relaxation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s aesthetically beautiful</p>
<p>when you are walking down one of these long avenues</p>
<p>and you turn.</p>
<p>And I think they have a name for this in New York</p>
<p>where the sunset is suddenly visible</p>
<p>along a long avenue between some skyscrapers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just very relaxing to be able suddenly</p>
<p>to see at a distance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually because this eye mechanism</p>
<p>relaxing the lens and relaxing some of the musculature</p>
<p>around the eyes,</p>
<p>send signals deep into the brainstem</p>
<p>that release some of the centers</p>
<p>that are involved in alertness, AKA stress.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very pleasant for a reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a placebo effect, if you will.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of neurochemicals</p>
<p>and things that are associated with that.</p>
<p>So try and see at a distance</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for your eyesight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll keep this lens nice and elastic</p>
<p>and the muscles nice and strong that move the lens.</p>
<p>And it has this relaxing component to it.</p>
<p>Our visual system is exquisitely tuned to motion,</p>
<p>not just our self-generated motion,</p>
<p>but the motion of things around us.</p>
<p>And one of the things that it does</p>
<p>is something called smooth pursuit.</p>
<p>Smooth pursuit is our ability to track individual objects</p>
<p>moving as the name suggests,</p>
<p>smoothly through space in various trajectories.</p>
<p>You can actually train or improve your vision</p>
<p>by looking at smooth pursuit stimuli.</p>
<p>And that sounds really boring.</p>
<p>What you can do is, and I&rsquo;ll provide a link to some</p>
<p>that I think are pretty good</p>
<p>that are used in various clinics,</p>
<p>ophthalmology and optometry clinics.</p>
<p>You can actually take a few minutes each day,</p>
<p>or maybe if you don&rsquo;t do it each day,</p>
<p>you could do every third day or so,</p>
<p>and actually just visually track a ball.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s moving in and kind of an infinity symbol.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s more of a sawtooth.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s changing speed.</p>
<p>Sometimes the cue that you&rsquo;re following,</p>
<p>the little target is dilating and contracting.</p>
<p>This is going to keep the muscles, I want to be clear,</p>
<p>this is going to keep the extraocular muscles</p>
<p>conditioned and strong,</p>
<p>and allow you to have a healthy smooth pursuit system.</p>
<p>Remember, the brain follows the eye.</p>
<p>It follows the movements of the eye.</p>
<p>It has to deal with that.</p>
<p>And the neural circuits within the brain</p>
<p>have to cope with changes in smooth pursuit.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of reading up close,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not viewing horizons,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting a lot of smooth pursuit type stimulation</p>
<p>from your life,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just getting it within the confines</p>
<p>of a little box on your phone,</p>
<p>like your smooth pursuit is over millimeters</p>
<p>or what we always talk in terms of visual angle,</p>
<p>but the amount of degrees of visual angle.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just looking at smooth pursuit</p>
<p>in this little tiny box on your phone</p>
<p>or on your computer screen,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not looking at objects in your environment,</p>
<p>like swooping birds and things like that,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m guessing many of you</p>
<p>are not spending your time doing,</p>
<p>well, these mechanisms for smooth pursuit</p>
<p>will get worse over time.</p>
<p>Your vision will get worse.</p>
<p>And so while I prefer that people get out</p>
<p>into the real world and experience</p>
<p>smooth pursuit tracking of visual objects,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s a good reason</p>
<p>to go to a hockey game or, you know,</p>
<p>and try and keep your eye on the puck,</p>
<p>which I can never seem to do, move so fast.</p>
<p>Or I guess this is a good reason to watch live sports,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>or watch a tennis match like a cat, like a kitten,</p>
<p>watching the ball go back and forth.</p>
<p>Whatever, watching kids play, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>The idea is that you want to use the visual system regularly</p>
<p>for what it was designed for,</p>
<p>and smooth pursuit is a great way</p>
<p>to keep the visual and motion tracking systems</p>
<p>of the brain and the eye and the extraocular muscles</p>
<p>working in a really nice coordinate fashion.</p>
<p>I would say five to 10 minutes, three times a week,</p>
<p>will be great.</p>
<p>If you care about your vision,</p>
<p>you can train your vision in this way.</p>
<p>The other one is to train accommodation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of videos out there,</p>
<p>I want to be clear, on the internet,</p>
<p>some of which are from clinicians, some of which are not,</p>
<p>some of which are from scientists,</p>
<p>some of which are from other sources,</p>
<p>talking about things you can do to make your vision better,</p>
<p>to improve your vision.</p>
<p>Most of those are geared toward</p>
<p>improving the extraocular eye muscles.</p>
<p>But I did consult with our chair of ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine, Jeff Goldberg,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an MD and a PhD, a phenomenal scientist</p>
<p>and a phenomenal clinician,</p>
<p>and incidentally, a phenomenal chairman as well,</p>
<p>about what sorts of things, tools,</p>
<p>are actually beneficial for pattern vision and sight,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just so much out there on the internet,</p>
<p>not all of which is accurate or good, frankly.</p>
<p>And he agreed that a smooth pursuit stimulus,</p>
<p>that kind of training, as well as, or exercise,</p>
<p>as well as near-far.</p>
<p>So spending a few minutes,</p>
<p>you might even just do this for two minutes,</p>
<p>of looking at something up close,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to activate these accommodation mechanisms,</p>
<p>and then moving it at arm&rsquo;s length</p>
<p>and focusing on it for five, 10 seconds, maybe more,</p>
<p>maybe 15 or 20 seconds,</p>
<p>then slowly moving it into a location and then out.</p>
<p>This is actually a lot like the visual training</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done post-concussion to try and repair,</p>
<p>actually repair some of the balance and motor and visual</p>
<p>and cognitive aspects of the brain.</p>
<p>And we are going to have a guest on in a future time,</p>
<p>that to deal with concussion</p>
<p>and some post-concussion training,</p>
<p>a lot of post-concussion recovery and training</p>
<p>centers around the visual system,</p>
<p>not just because people are trying to recover their vision</p>
<p>and their sense of balance,</p>
<p>but because, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to make sense of its environment</p>
<p>and the brain&rsquo;s ability to parse time,</p>
<p>not just on the day-night schedule,</p>
<p>but also shorter time intervals,</p>
<p>follows the visual system.</p>
<p>Something we&rsquo;ll turn to a little bit more at the end.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>The tool is spend two to three minutes</p>
<p>doing smooth pursuit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some programs on YouTube.</p>
<p>You can just look up smooth pursuit stimulus</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll provide a link to a couple I like as well.</p>
<p>You could do this with a pen if you wanted.</p>
<p>You could do this,</p>
<p>someone else could hold a wand and you could do that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got someone that can do that for you,</p>
<p>practice accommodation for a few minutes,</p>
<p>maybe every other day, just bringing something in close.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel the strain of your eyes doing that.</p>
<p>I can feel it right now.</p>
<p>Move it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel a relaxation point.</p>
<p>Move it past that relaxation point</p>
<p>where you will have to do what&rsquo;s called a virgin&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p>movement to maintain focus on that location</p>
<p>as it moves out, bring it back in.</p>
<p>At the point where you actually have to go cross-eyed,</p>
<p>this will differ for different people</p>
<p>depending on how far apart your eyes are,</p>
<p>so-called interpupillary distance.</p>
<p>So for me, I have been teased before</p>
<p>I have a very short interpupillary distance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a cyclops, but I&rsquo;m heading there.</p>
<p>Some people are more wall-eyed, like a flounder.</p>
<p>Well, depending on your interpupillary distance,</p>
<p>the point at which things get blurry</p>
<p>and cross-eyed will vary.</p>
<p>But for me, you know, as I get about,</p>
<p>oh gosh, I guess it&rsquo;s about six inches from my nose,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard, I can&rsquo;t accommodate any longer.</p>
<p>I move it out another inch and everything&rsquo;s in nice focus.</p>
<p>Try and see whether or not you can get things closer.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t want to get cross-eyed.</p>
<p>Remember what your parents told you?</p>
<p>Or my parents told me that if you cross your eyes</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young, that they can stay that way.</p>
<p>Actually, they won&rsquo;t necessarily stay that way,</p>
<p>but your brain can start losing information</p>
<p>and the ability to see binocular depth,</p>
<p>something we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>But for now, the protocol would be, you know,</p>
<p>two to three, maybe five minutes.</p>
<p>Just practice that, practice accommodation,</p>
<p>and then be sure to give your eyes some rest.</p>
<p>Get outside, look at a horizon, or do nothing.</p>
<p>Just kind of let your eyes go soft.</p>
<p>I guess what the yogis would call soft gaze.</p>
<p>Just kind of relax your eyelids.</p>
<p>Not this, not eyes closed.</p>
<p>Just relax, panoramic vision.</p>
<p>Try and see the walls around you without moving your head.</p>
<p>Exercise your eye muscles.</p>
<p>Exercise the accommodation mechanisms of your eyes.</p>
<p>Practice a little bit of smooth pursuit.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be neurotic about this,</p>
<p>but if you do this often enough,</p>
<p>meaning every other day, every third day or so,</p>
<p>you can be the strange person on the plane</p>
<p>or in the classroom doing this.</p>
<p>You know, people might chuckle or look at you funny</p>
<p>or tease you, but that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll be able to see</p>
<p>when they are losing their vision.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll get the last laugh.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t laugh at them,</p>
<p>but maybe you can help them at that point.</p>
<p>You can hold the pen for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really worth preserving your vision.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re a young person, this is great</p>
<p>because then you can actually build</p>
<p>an extra strong visual system</p>
<p>using all the tools that we&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>I do want to talk about a new set of findings</p>
<p>that are related to red light</p>
<p>and offsetting age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways in which our visual system</p>
<p>gets worse over time,</p>
<p>but one is so-called age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p>Glenn Jeffrey at the University College of London,</p>
<p>somebody I&rsquo;ve known for decades because he&rsquo;s a scientist,</p>
<p>has done beautiful work on development</p>
<p>and function of the visual system,</p>
<p>has published a number of papers recently.</p>
<p>One that got a particularly high amount of attention</p>
<p>in the press was one that showed</p>
<p>that flashing red light into the eyes early in the day,</p>
<p>not late in the day, early in the day,</p>
<p>can help offset some age-related macular degeneration,</p>
<p>presumably by enhancing the mitochondrial function</p>
<p>in the photoreceptors.</p>
<p>There does seem to be some evidence for that,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s still early days.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to shine really bright lights into your eyes.</p>
<p>You never want to look at any light that&rsquo;s so bright</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>And you never want to force your eyelids to stay open.</p>
<p>If you need to close your eyes in order to be comfortable,</p>
<p>well, then chances are that light is too bright.</p>
<p>But doing just a couple minutes a day,</p>
<p>two minutes a day of flashing this red light</p>
<p>into one eye and then the other,</p>
<p>as long as it was early in the day, before noontime,</p>
<p>and as long as it was in individuals</p>
<p>that were 40 years or older,</p>
<p>did seem to have a significant effect</p>
<p>in offsetting some of the age-related macular degeneration</p>
<p>that would otherwise occur.</p>
<p>Again, these are early findings.</p>
<p>If you want to do this, please be careful.</p>
<p>Please talk to your optometrist and or ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Your eyesight is precious.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to damage it,</p>
<p>but it is interesting,</p>
<p>and it does seem like red light</p>
<p>can improve the function of the mitochondria.</p>
<p>These photoreceptors have a lot of mitochondria,</p>
<p>the energy-producing organelles within the cells,</p>
<p>because they are some of the most metabolically active cells</p>
<p>in your entire body.</p>
<p>Your photoreceptors are active all the time</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re looking around,</p>
<p>and even when your eyes are closed, they&rsquo;re active.</p>
<p>In fact, through a weird twist of the biology,</p>
<p>and please look this up</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really interested in this,</p>
<p>your photoreceptors are actually most active in the dark.</p>
<p>This is so weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a twist of biology, the way the system&rsquo;s arranged,</p>
<p>that when light comes on, they shut off their activity.</p>
<p>So actually, whether or not you see something</p>
<p>in front of you like this pen or my face</p>
<p>is because the way your photoreceptors are turning off,</p>
<p>not turning on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really cool twist,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to go too far down that rabbit hole,</p>
<p>but check it out.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how photoreceptors work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an absolutely incredible literature.</p>
<p>Just Google, excuse me, look up on the web.</p>
<p>We are not partial just to Google.</p>
<p>I happen to use Google,</p>
<p>but use your web browser to look up</p>
<p>photoreceptors hyperpolarization site,</p>
<p>and you can learn a lot about that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a real nerd for this stuff like I am.</p>
<p>Okay, so red light to the eye can perhaps, it seems,</p>
<p>help maintain vision, doing smooth pursuit exercises,</p>
<p>and accommodation, near-far exercises.</p>
<p>Some people suffer from poor eyesight</p>
<p>simply because their eyes get dry.</p>
<p>There are incredible, believe it or not,</p>
<p>lubricating mechanisms for the eye,</p>
<p>not just tears, but thin sheet of oil.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>Unless you have some sort of corneal abrasion,</p>
<p>the cornea is the clear stuff on the outside of your eye,</p>
<p>corneal abrasion, when you blink, it&rsquo;s smooth.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really, really smooth,</p>
<p>and yet if you&rsquo;ve ever had a corneal scratch,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this, it&rsquo;s really rough.</p>
<p>It is so painful.</p>
<p>You have a ton of pain receptors in the cornea.</p>
<p>The lubrication of the cornea is supported by blinking.</p>
<p>And while it seems a little silly,</p>
<p>some people actually benefit from doing, you know,</p>
<p>some, you know, five or 10 or 15 seconds of blinking,</p>
<p>and then doing their focused work.</p>
<p>Some people, their eyes are drying out</p>
<p>because as we focus, if we&rsquo;re trying to do something,</p>
<p>our eyelids stay open, the eyes can dry out,</p>
<p>but it also can make it such that</p>
<p>when we blink the next time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of a need to focus</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some distortions in these oils and liquids</p>
<p>across the corneal surface.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who suffers from dry eye,</p>
<p>I do hope they&rsquo;ll find a treatment or a cure for dry eye</p>
<p>soon, there isn&rsquo;t one at present.</p>
<p>Someone stands to make a lot of money out there.</p>
<p>If you can find a cure for dry eye,</p>
<p>let the companies know or start a company.</p>
<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s still a mystery as to how to do that,</p>
<p>but blinking for five to 15 seconds,</p>
<p>probably slowly, not as quickly as I&rsquo;m doing here on video,</p>
<p>but just, you know, maybe a blink every second or two,</p>
<p>for 15 seconds can lubricate the eyes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not directly related to anything neural,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to allow the optics of your eye to be clear.</p>
<p>Just like when the screen of your phone gets dirty,</p>
<p>like when Costello is texting on my phone</p>
<p>and I pick it up and it&rsquo;s like covered with smudge,</p>
<p>to clean it off in order to see things clearly,</p>
<p>the same thing is happening for these optical devices</p>
<p>on the front of your brain.</p>
<p>Remember, these are brain.</p>
<p>Okay, so a lot of protocols today, almost all of them,</p>
<p>behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>I do want to talk a little bit more about vision</p>
<p>and how it works internally.</p>
<p>And then I also want to talk about</p>
<p>some of the foods and supplements that have been shown</p>
<p>to support vision and offset visual loss,</p>
<p>and maybe even reverse some visual loss.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about binocular vision and lazy eye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very familiar with lazy eye because when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I went swimming one day, one day,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have my goggles.</p>
<p>And so something must&rsquo;ve been happening, as I recall,</p>
<p>with the eye moving down through the water.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had this problem that I can only do</p>
<p>the freestyle stroke off to one side.</p>
<p>The people I swim with are always laughing.</p>
<p>Somehow I kind of move toward drowning</p>
<p>when I try and breathe on the right side.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some asymmetry in the way I&rsquo;m organized.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was off to my left and my eye kept going</p>
<p>in and out of the water and there was chlorine in the water</p>
<p>and it was making my eye uncomfortable,</p>
<p>so I just closed my eye.</p>
<p>I just decided, you know,</p>
<p>I knew more or less how to swim straight-ish.</p>
<p>Might&rsquo;ve bounced off the lane lines a few times,</p>
<p>but I just used the other eye to kind of steer</p>
<p>for that mark on the wall.</p>
<p>Got out of the pool, took a shower, dried off,</p>
<p>and then completely lost binocular vision for three days.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>The young brain, up until about age seven,</p>
<p>but maybe even extending out until about age 12,</p>
<p>is extremely vulnerable to differences in ocular input</p>
<p>between the two eyes.</p>
<p>My scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for discovering so-called critical periods,</p>
<p>periods of time in which the brain is more plastic,</p>
<p>more able to change.</p>
<p>Those two guys, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,</p>
<p>thank you, David and Torsten,</p>
<p>forever changed the face of visual neuroscience</p>
<p>and forever changed the way we think</p>
<p>about treatment of the young brain.</p>
<p>It used to be thought that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do a surgery</p>
<p>on a young kid because of risk of anesthesia</p>
<p>in young individuals,</p>
<p>but we now know that you need to repair these imbalances</p>
<p>that even a few hours, okay?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to scare anybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about reversal,</p>
<p>but a few hours of occluding one eye early in life</p>
<p>can lead to permanent, unless something&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>permanent changes in the way that the brain perceives</p>
<p>the outside world,</p>
<p>such that when that eye is opened up again,</p>
<p>the brain actually can&rsquo;t make sense of anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming through it.</p>
<p>It shuts down that visual pathway somehow.</p>
<p>So what happened to me was I actually was,</p>
<p>my eye was fine.</p>
<p>I got out of the pool, I opened my eye,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t see through that eye.</p>
<p>Everything was blurry, double vision,</p>
<p>unless I covered this eye,</p>
<p>and then I could see perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I went to an ophthalmologist</p>
<p>who understood the literature.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie,</p>
<p>who understood the literature</p>
<p>and made it clear that what I needed to do</p>
<p>was to occlude the other eye,</p>
<p>the eye that was working very well.</p>
<p>Clearly he understood the work of Hubel and Wiesel.</p>
<p>Now, again, you don&rsquo;t want to start playing games</p>
<p>with this kind of stuff when you&rsquo;re a kid.</p>
<p>If you wear, let&rsquo;s say you have a Halloween costume</p>
<p>and you wear an eye patch,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a pirate or something for Halloween,</p>
<p>and you cover it up on one side,</p>
<p>probably for the night of Halloween, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I do not recommend doing that recreationally</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t need that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a young child or for your child to do that,</p>
<p>because indeed you create imbalances in the brain machinery</p>
<p>that compares information coming in through the two eyes,</p>
<p>and it can shut down the neural information</p>
<p>for the occluded, the closed eye.</p>
<p>Now, I was able to reverse this issue,</p>
<p>but my binocular vision has never been terrific.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much better at the dartboard and still not very good.</p>
<p>If I close one eye, I&rsquo;m much better at the pool table.</p>
<p>If I close one eye and I still am terrible.</p>
<p>I was the kid and, you know, in the outfield,</p>
<p>you know, the ball&rsquo;s coming towards me,</p>
<p>the ball&rsquo;s coming towards me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to catch the ball</p>
<p>and like a hit me square in the lip.</p>
<p>My binocular vision isn&rsquo;t great</p>
<p>as a consequence of this early event.</p>
<p>And I have a hard time with those binocular stereograms,</p>
<p>those images that are kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to look at them,</p>
<p>and then the binocular depth image like pops out.</p>
<p>All the other kids were going,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the whatever, the Statue of Liberty,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the American, I see dots, okay?</p>
<p>So I have binocular vision, but I use other cues.</p>
<p>I use the near-far cues that I talked about before,</p>
<p>motion parallax, the fact that things are closer to me</p>
<p>are moving faster than things further away</p>
<p>in order to judge depth.</p>
<p>And years later, when I got involved in,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t suggest this for most people,</p>
<p>I got involved in boxing and martial arts when I was younger.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;ll see fighters,</p>
<p>this is a slip to avoid getting punched.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also generating motion parallax.</p>
<p>Many animals judge depth by moving their head,</p>
<p>not by using other mechanisms of accommodation, okay?</p>
<p>So a lot of birds and monkeys and animals</p>
<p>will judge depth by moving their head like this,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll move from side to side.</p>
<p>Animals that will undulate sometimes</p>
<p>are actually doing a depth measurement</p>
<p>because as you move from side to side,</p>
<p>the brain is able to do the math of depth.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean in terms of protocols?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a young person,</p>
<p>do your best to get really good binocular vision,</p>
<p>not just at level of your phone or your tablet,</p>
<p>but also at distance.</p>
<p>You will build strong binocular visual machinery</p>
<p>in the brain and at the level of the eyes</p>
<p>and the eye musculature.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re somebody who did have an occlusion,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s needed is to cover up the other eye,</p>
<p>to create an imbalance so that the weak eye,</p>
<p>the so-called lazy eye,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sometimes referred to as amblyopia,</p>
<p>that eye has to work harder.</p>
<p>So for me, they patched this other eye and made this eye,</p>
<p>eventually I got vision through that eye back,</p>
<p>then they opened them both up.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask,</p>
<p>what happens if you cover both eyes early in life?</p>
<p>And this is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>You might think, well,</p>
<p>if covering one eye leads to poor vision for that eye</p>
<p>after that eye is open,</p>
<p>covering both eyes will probably make you blind, right?</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not what happens.</p>
<p>What Hubel and Wiesel discovered</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s been affirmed many, many more times over</p>
<p>in subsequent studies is that it&rsquo;s competitive,</p>
<p>that the two eyes are competing</p>
<p>for real estate up in the brain.</p>
<p>So if you actually cover both eyes,</p>
<p>you actually extend the period of critical plasticity.</p>
<p>This is a really interesting aspect</p>
<p>that other people are starting to leverage now</p>
<p>in terms of how to reopen plasticity later in life.</p>
<p>But please don&rsquo;t go around</p>
<p>with your eyes covered for too long.</p>
<p>There are some like retreats and stuff</p>
<p>where people go into caves with absolutely no vision,</p>
<p>creates hallucinations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about why that is in just a moment.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s my suggestion.</p>
<p>Try and get balanced visual input through the two eyes.</p>
<p>Almost everybody has a dominant eye.</p>
<p>It usually doesn&rsquo;t relate to your dominant hand,</p>
<p>although it can.</p>
<p>And so for me, if I cover up my right eye,</p>
<p>I see much less well, much more poorly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit fuzzy and I have to work harder</p>
<p>in order to see the camera, for instance.</p>
<p>Then if I cover up my left eye,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually really easy for me to relax.</p>
<p>I have a dominant eye.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can balance that out</p>
<p>by covering up the dominant eye a little bit each day.</p>
<p>But I would warn any young people,</p>
<p>meaning 12 or younger, against creating these imbalances</p>
<p>if there isn&rsquo;t a clinical need to do that.</p>
<p>And if you do have strong imbalances between the two eyes,</p>
<p>which can be caused by cataract and lens issues,</p>
<p>can be caused by neuromuscular issues, et cetera,</p>
<p>to try and get those dealt with as early as possible</p>
<p>by contacting a really good ophthalmologist</p>
<p>and ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>It is very normal, I should say it&rsquo;s very common</p>
<p>for young children, babies to have an eye with strabismus</p>
<p>that either deviates out or that deviates in.</p>
<p>It is important to correct that</p>
<p>if you would like to have balanced vision</p>
<p>between the two eyes and for the brain to respond</p>
<p>equally to the two eyes and to have,</p>
<p>I would say high fidelity quality vision.</p>
<p>Although some people who have an eye that drifts</p>
<p>can function normally in life,</p>
<p>you have an opportunity early in life to rescue that.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t do, well, maybe I will do this,</p>
<p>but I can actually relax this eye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weak in some cases</p>
<p>that it actually can start to deviate.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll just do this here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not crossing my eyes.</p>
<p>So I actually can move my, I can misalign my eyes</p>
<p>because I have to fight very hard</p>
<p>to have the musculature for this eye</p>
<p>keep that eye aligned with the other eye.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been doing eye exercises</p>
<p>since I was in my 20s</p>
<p>because I noticed when I would study a lot,</p>
<p>this eye would start to drift in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d start to see double</p>
<p>and then next thing you know,</p>
<p>I was just covering the eye up.</p>
<p>It was getting weaker and weaker,</p>
<p>just like the atrophy of a muscle.</p>
<p>So I went to the doctor.</p>
<p>What did they do?</p>
<p>They did the exact wrong thing.</p>
<p>The optometrist I went to gave me a prism</p>
<p>which adjusted it so that I could see things normally,</p>
<p>which just made the eye weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like putting a weak arm into a sling.</p>
<p>So I had to spend at least three years of 10 minutes a day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what I recommend,</p>
<p>doing near-far, covering up my good eye,</p>
<p>doing near-far with my bad eye,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s been about 10, 12 years</p>
<p>that I have pretty decent binocular vision.</p>
<p>Now, many of you aren&rsquo;t dealing with this</p>
<p>or have these early childhood issues.</p>
<p>Some of you might be experiencing challenges</p>
<p>with fatigued eyes</p>
<p>or with differences in focus with the two eyes.</p>
<p>These eye exercises of near-far, smooth pursuit</p>
<p>and checking for dominant and non-dominant eye</p>
<p>can be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not a clinician,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t want to give you protocols</p>
<p>or enforce protocols on anybody.</p>
<p>You need to figure out what&rsquo;s right and safe for you,</p>
<p>given your vision history.</p>
<p>I do recommend talking to a really good ophthalmologist</p>
<p>if you have severe vision problems of any kind,</p>
<p>or if you want to offset vision problems of any kind,</p>
<p>an optometrist as well,</p>
<p>but ideally it would be a neuro-ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Okay, I did mention hallucinations</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fun to talk about and think about.</p>
<p>For years, people have asked,</p>
<p>why do people get visual hallucinations?</p>
<p>Costello&rsquo;s in sleep right now.</p>
<p>You can probably hear him snoring.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s snoring so loud.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably having hallucinations about rabbits, pizza,</p>
<p>and those are mainly his favorite thing, and sleep.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dreaming about sleep in sleep.</p>
<p>Hallucinations are a property of the visual system,</p>
<p>and it was always thought that hallucinations arise</p>
<p>because of over-activation or activation</p>
<p>of certain aspects of the visual system.</p>
<p>I just briefly want to mention a paper</p>
<p>that was published by my good friend</p>
<p>and phenomenal scientist and physicist for that matter,</p>
<p>Chris Neal, who&rsquo;s up at the University of Oregon in Eugene.</p>
<p>They studied LSD-like compounds and discovered</p>
<p>that hallucinations actually occur</p>
<p>because portions of your brain become underactive.</p>
<p>The visual portions of the brain are under-stimulated.</p>
<p>This is probably why when people go into these cave retreats,</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve never done, I don&rsquo;t think I ever will do,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s completely black,</p>
<p>pretty soon they start hallucinating.</p>
<p>They start seeing things even though there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>The visual system is desperate to make guesses</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s out in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the eager beaver of your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>Even in low to no vision people, blind people,</p>
<p>their brain is going to be making guesses</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s out there in the auditory world,</p>
<p>what sounds are there, what touch sensations are there.</p>
<p>For sighted folks, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s out there in terms of light.</p>
<p>Light is the dominant way,</p>
<p>vision is the dominant way</p>
<p>that we evaluate the world around us.</p>
<p>So it turns out that hallucinations</p>
<p>are an under activation of the visual system</p>
<p>and then a compensatory, a compensation</p>
<p>by which the visual system creates activity</p>
<p>and hallucinations.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in the dark long enough,</p>
<p>you start to hallucinate and see things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little note about hallucinations.</p>
<p>One of the things that you can do to improve your vision,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also kind of fun,</p>
<p>is to put a Snellen chart in your home.</p>
<p>A Snellen chart is that list of letters.</p>
<p>If you go to the dreaded Department of Motor Vehicles,</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;m up for renewal soon.</p>
<p>So I love the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>The Department of Motor Vehicles</p>
<p>will have you cover up an eye,</p>
<p>read the letters on the chart.</p>
<p>The letters of course get smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to figure out roughly what your vision is.</p>
<p>Cover up the other eye, you&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>Some people, including nerdy vision scientists like me,</p>
<p>have had Snellen charts in their office</p>
<p>or in their home for many years now.</p>
<p>And you can just practice and you can see how you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>sitting at a particular distance.</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s not often mentioned,</p>
<p>but your performance on the Snellen chart will vary</p>
<p>depending on time of day,</p>
<p>because your level of fatigue</p>
<p>and your ability to control that accommodation</p>
<p>and other mechanisms of the eye muscles will vary.</p>
<p>So you can take it as an average.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a good thing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to get your vision tested</p>
<p>for corrective lenses,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re going to do laser surgery</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about any of that,</p>
<p>to really get it measured by a professional,</p>
<p>the ones that you get in those supermarkets</p>
<p>or in many eyeglass stores,</p>
<p>apologies to the eyeglass stores,</p>
<p>are often wrong by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>And then when you start putting corrective lenses on</p>
<p>that are over-correcting or under-correcting,</p>
<p>but more often are over-correcting,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re essentially weakening the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like putting a prosthetic on a limb</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t necessarily need,</p>
<p>or a robot arm when you didn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>the use of the robot arm.</p>
<p>Although now there&rsquo;s so much excitement about robots.</p>
<p>I think people are going to be doing that.</p>
<p>Anyway, nonetheless,</p>
<p>get your vision tested by somebody</p>
<p>who really understands vision,</p>
<p>like an ophthalmologist or a really good optometrist.</p>
<p>If you put a Snellen chart in your home,</p>
<p>you can do that as part of your visual training.</p>
<p>Now, this might seem excessively nerdy,</p>
<p>but what is more important than your eyesight?</p>
<p>Eyesight is so vital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right up there with movement</p>
<p>and our ability to move, to generate,</p>
<p>to get up out of chairs and to walk and to run</p>
<p>and to take care of ourselves.</p>
<p>Eyesight and movement are the main ways</p>
<p>that we are able to take care of ourselves</p>
<p>and take care of others.</p>
<p>When you start having compromised eyesight</p>
<p>or compromised movement,</p>
<p>people need to take care of us</p>
<p>and we become much more challenged</p>
<p>in moving through our daily life.</p>
<p>So while it might seem nerdy</p>
<p>to have a Snellen chart in your home,</p>
<p>or to do a smooth pursuit exercise a couple of times a week,</p>
<p>or to get outside for a few hours a day</p>
<p>and do your reading or your laptop work there,</p>
<p>preserving your eyesight and preserving your vision</p>
<p>is one of the most life enhancing</p>
<p>or quality of life enhancing things that you can do.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a young person</p>
<p>and you can build some of this</p>
<p>into your framework of exercise or brain training,</p>
<p>if you want to call it that,</p>
<p>that can be immensely beneficial</p>
<p>and will really set you up to have really good vision</p>
<p>over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are genetic factors</p>
<p>and there are injury related factors</p>
<p>that can compromise eyesight and our ability to see.</p>
<p>And of course, the things I&rsquo;m talking about today</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to solve all those issues,</p>
<p>but they can have a tremendous positive impact</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to do just a little bit of work.</p>
<p>And none of this is involving any cost, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just time cost.</p>
<p>So I do want to talk about a few other things</p>
<p>that can perhaps improve vision.</p>
<p>I want to dispel a few myths</p>
<p>about stuff to take to improve vision.</p>
<p>And then I want to just close</p>
<p>by talking about how we perceive time using our vision,</p>
<p>because that will nicely set the stage</p>
<p>for what we&rsquo;re going to talk about next episode.</p>
<p>So now you understand a lot about the biology of vision.</p>
<p>You understand that light has to arrive at the retina</p>
<p>and get converted into electrical signals.</p>
<p>That process requires things like vitamin A,</p>
<p>a fat soluble vitamin.</p>
<p>It requires things like the carotenoids.</p>
<p>That metabolic cascade,</p>
<p>that biochemical cascade is essential for vision.</p>
<p>And this is why you&rsquo;ve been told</p>
<p>that carrots help you see better</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re high in vitamin A.</p>
<p>There are a few simple things you can do</p>
<p>to support your vision.</p>
<p>First of all, it is true that eating vegetables,</p>
<p>the dark leafy vegetables,</p>
<p>and things like carrots that have vitamin A in abundance,</p>
<p>and eating them in close to their raw form,</p>
<p>so naturally occurring foods</p>
<p>that contain a lot of vitamin A in their raw form</p>
<p>can help support vision.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean that if you ingest</p>
<p>super physiological amounts of that stuff</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to make your vision that much better?</p>
<p>No, but you do need a threshold level of vitamin A</p>
<p>in order to see, and in order to see well.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement nowadays</p>
<p>about supplementation to help support the health</p>
<p>of the visual system.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m somebody who&rsquo;s pretty open</p>
<p>to novel forms of supplementation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably gathered that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been listening to this podcast for a while.</p>
<p>You have to determine what&rsquo;s safe,</p>
<p>and economical, and right for you,</p>
<p>what your risk tolerance is, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I want to talk about a molecule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in a lot of supplements to support vision.</p>
<p>And there are some really good data on, and that&rsquo;s lutein.</p>
<p>Now, the study I want to describe</p>
<p>is actually published in 2016.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the Journal of Ophthalmology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good journal.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper might catch your attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Increased Macular Pigment Optical Density.</p>
<p>That just means that the macula is an area of the eye</p>
<p>for central vision, for high acuity vision.</p>
<p>Pigment density there is good.</p>
<p>You want pigment there.</p>
<p>Increased macular pigment optical density</p>
<p>and visual acuity.</p>
<p>Visual acuity is your ability to see things in fine detail.</p>
<p>Following consumption of a buttermilk drink</p>
<p>containing lutein-enriched egg yolks.</p>
<p>Remember raw foods?</p>
<p>Lutein-enriched egg yolks.</p>
<p>Sounds like a Rocky movie</p>
<p>where he would drink the raw egg yolks.</p>
<p>A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting you go out and eat raw egg yolks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the risk of salmonella.</p>
<p>Although I did hear this, someone correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>that the salmonella is actually on the outside of the egg,</p>
<p>not actually in the egg itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the shell for reasons that relate</p>
<p>to how that egg got into the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the salmonella lives.</p>
<p>But I could be wrong about that.</p>
<p>But raw egg yolks are not something</p>
<p>that most people want to consume.</p>
<p>What is this lutein stuff?</p>
<p>Well, lutein is in the pathway that relates to vitamin A</p>
<p>and the formation of the opsin, the photopigment</p>
<p>that captures light in the back of your eye,</p>
<p>literally absorbs light pigment in your eye</p>
<p>and converts that into electrical signals</p>
<p>and allows you to see.</p>
<p>And there is some evidence.</p>
<p>I spoke to our chair of ophthalmology.</p>
<p>There is some evidence through quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that supplementing with lutein can help offset</p>
<p>some of the detrimental effects</p>
<p>of age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p>But, I want to emphasize but, or emphasize however,</p>
<p>only for individuals with moderate</p>
<p>to severe macular degeneration.</p>
<p>For people that have normal vision</p>
<p>or with just a low degree of macular degeneration,</p>
<p>these studies did not see a significant improvement</p>
<p>of vision from supplementing with lutein.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you</p>
<p>to supplement with lutein or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any study is holy,</p>
<p>but it does seem that if you have moderate</p>
<p>to severe macular degeneration,</p>
<p>talk to your physician of course,</p>
<p>talk to your ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always say that and I&rsquo;ll say it three times.</p>
<p>Supplementing with lutein could perhaps</p>
<p>support vision and offset some visual loss in that case.</p>
<p>Probably also talk to your ophthalmologist</p>
<p>or consider the red light therapy</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Whereas if you have normal vision</p>
<p>or a low amount of macular degeneration,</p>
<p>it does not seem at least from these studies</p>
<p>that lutein can have much of an effect.</p>
<p>Now, I know and I confess I&rsquo;m sort of of the mind</p>
<p>that if I personally had age-related macular degeneration</p>
<p>or a propensity for it in my family,</p>
<p>which fortunately I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But in that case, I would think that supplementing</p>
<p>with lutein provided it&rsquo;s safe,</p>
<p>could perhaps be of benefit.</p>
<p>You might want to consider a low dose of that.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not pushing any of this on anybody</p>
<p>by any means, but you should know that</p>
<p>under certain conditions of severe macular degeneration</p>
<p>or moderate macular degeneration,</p>
<p>it does seem like lutein can be beneficial.</p>
<p>It does not have to be consumed through raw egg yolks,</p>
<p>although that is the highest density source.</p>
<p>Cooking your eggs, if you like your scrambled eggs dry</p>
<p>or you like your eggs not easy over or whatever, not runny,</p>
<p>then you aren&rsquo;t going to get the benefits of the lutein.</p>
<p>There are other sources of lutein,</p>
<p>non-animal sources of lutein as well.</p>
<p>You can look those up on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, there are other compounds that have been shown</p>
<p>to perhaps be important for offsetting</p>
<p>or helping different forms of vision loss.</p>
<p>One is, I&rsquo;m going to spell this out,</p>
<p>I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E, indabone, indabenone, indabenone.</p>
<p>I can never pronounce these compounds, forgive me,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;ve worked with them.</p>
<p>There is evidence that it can be beneficial</p>
<p>for Leber&rsquo;s congenital eye disease.</p>
<p>I would definitely go onto examine.com, put in I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E</p>
<p>and for things like Leber&rsquo;s optic neuropathies,</p>
<p>which is a degenerative condition of the eye.</p>
<p>Whether or not people should just be taking this stuff</p>
<p>anyway is still an open question.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of studies about it.</p>
<p>A lot of people that are interested in taking things</p>
<p>to support their vision are taking lutein</p>
<p>as a preventative measure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pass any judgment one way or the other.</p>
<p>Typically those supplements also include the zeaxanthins</p>
<p>and the astaxanthins.</p>
<p>Okay, the pronunciation of this is terrible, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not too far off,</p>
<p>but basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.</p>
<p>You can see why it&rsquo;s hard to pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.</p>
<p>And the other one is A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.</p>
<p>Both of these have been shown, excuse me,</p>
<p>both of these have been shown to offset some</p>
<p>of the disruption in vision that occurs with aging.</p>
<p>What is Aztec saxanthin?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting compound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the red-pink pigment found in various seafoods.</p>
<p>So shrimp, I&rsquo;m not a big seafood fan,</p>
<p>but like certain fish, like the,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see at the fish market</p>
<p>will have that red-pink pigment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also in the feathers of flamingos.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t eat the feathers of flamingos</p>
<p>and please also don&rsquo;t eat flamingos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s structurally similar to beta carotene.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very pro-vitamin A,</p>
<p>but it has some chemical differences</p>
<p>which may make it safer than vitamin A.</p>
<p>Remember vitamin A is a lipid soluble vitamin.</p>
<p>So it can be stored in our body for long periods of time.</p>
<p>What is the deal with this Aztec saxanthin?</p>
<p>You know, what are its drawbacks?</p>
<p>Well, we can go to our ever favorite examine.com.</p>
<p>What does it do?</p>
<p>Well, it has a number of different effects,</p>
<p>a huge number in fact,</p>
<p>but it does seem to notably increase,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now been shown in three studies,</p>
<p>the antioxidant enzyme profile.</p>
<p>It has a number of different effects,</p>
<p>but the most notable for sake of this episode</p>
<p>is the one on ocular blood flow.</p>
<p>It does seem to increase the amount of ocular blood flow.</p>
<p>So the blood supply to the eyes.</p>
<p>So that makes it an interesting compound.</p>
<p>It has a number of other effects for whatever reason.</p>
<p>It also has a notable effect,</p>
<p>several studies have shown this,</p>
<p>on fertility in males.</p>
<p>So it seems to at least double the pregnancy rate</p>
<p>when men take Aztec saxanthin</p>
<p>and works as in particular, it seems here,</p>
<p>in men that were previously infertile.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that has something to do</p>
<p>with the blood flow to the eyes, probably not.</p>
<p>It probably has something to do</p>
<p>with something unrelated to the eyes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that&rsquo;s an effect of this molecule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been shown to have positive effects</p>
<p>on things like skin elasticity, skin moisture,</p>
<p>skin quality, et cetera,</p>
<p>probably due to its effects on blood flow.</p>
<p>So lutein, azaxanthin, A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.</p>
<p>And for people who have concerns</p>
<p>about Leber&rsquo;s optic neuropathies,</p>
<p>which is going to be a small percentage</p>
<p>of people out there, but that is a pretty severe condition.</p>
<p>There are supplements that are available out there.</p>
<p>I do encourage you as always to talk to your ophthalmologist</p>
<p>and physician about them.</p>
<p>And I will say that there are a number of people</p>
<p>that take lutein and some of these other things</p>
<p>as a precautionary measure</p>
<p>in order to bolster their health.</p>
<p>In the same way that some people take vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>to bolster their health, and some people are very health,</p>
<p>excuse me, and some people are very averse</p>
<p>to taking vitamins and minerals</p>
<p>because they feel like they can get all that</p>
<p>from healthy whole foods.</p>
<p>And of course you can get these things from whole foods.</p>
<p>The question is whether or not you can get them</p>
<p>in concentrations that are sufficient.</p>
<p>I do think that in the years to come,</p>
<p>we are going to see more about lutein.</p>
<p>I think we are going to see more</p>
<p>about some of these other compounds like astaxanthin,</p>
<p>and hopefully by then I&rsquo;ll be able to pronounce it.</p>
<p>But at present, these things are more or less</p>
<p>in the kind of experimental or self-experimental phase.</p>
<p>There are some good double-blind placebo-controlled studies</p>
<p>like the egg yolk buttermilk study of all things</p>
<p>published in really good journals.</p>
<p>Journal of Ophthalmology,</p>
<p>Journal Investigative Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences.</p>
<p>These are good journals.</p>
<p>These are journals that are peer-reviewed by experts.</p>
<p>The study that I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>about keeping rooms dark,</p>
<p>that was also published in an excellent journal.</p>
<p>I think it was JAMA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go back and look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not on my screen any longer, but very easy to find.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been some follow-up studies as well</p>
<p>from the University of Pennsylvania and other universities.</p>
<p>So everything I&rsquo;ve talked about today</p>
<p>relates to studies that were done</p>
<p>and published in quality peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you want to run out</p>
<p>and start taking the stuff that I&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>or even doing the protocols I&rsquo;ve described.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given you an array, a palette, a buffet, if you will,</p>
<p>of things that you could do to try and enhance</p>
<p>or support your vision,</p>
<p>depending on how good your vision is,</p>
<p>your family history of vision and vision loss,</p>
<p>your occupational hazards.</p>
<p>You know, people that work with metal filings</p>
<p>that are flying out of machines</p>
<p>are going to have a higher degree of vision,</p>
<p>you know, risk to their visual system</p>
<p>than will people who just do office work.</p>
<p>Although if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of office work,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re not getting a lot of long view vision,</p>
<p>your accommodation mechanisms</p>
<p>are going to start to suffer over time.</p>
<p>I think we can reliably predict that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve tried to give you an array of behavioral tools</p>
<p>and we did touch upon some supplementation tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>because blood flow is so critical</p>
<p>for the neurons of the eye,</p>
<p>remember these are the most metabolically active cells</p>
<p>in your entire body, the cells within your retina,</p>
<p>because blood flow is required</p>
<p>to get them the energy and nutrients they need.</p>
<p>Having a healthy cardiovascular system, right?</p>
<p>Doing endurance work, doing strength training work</p>
<p>regularly is going to support your eyes</p>
<p>and your brain and your vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s indirect, but it&rsquo;s essential, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary, but it&rsquo;s not going to be sufficient.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to do other things</p>
<p>to support your eyesight as well.</p>
<p>But having a healthy cardiovascular system</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to deliver blood and oxygen</p>
<p>and nutrients to this incredible apparati</p>
<p>on the front of your face,</p>
<p>these two pieces of brain is going to support</p>
<p>your overall brain health and vision over time.</p>
<p>So early in the podcast,</p>
<p>I talked about how the optimal window</p>
<p>for learning is 90 minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the so-called ultradian cycle for learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we held our episodes to about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now starting to extend</p>
<p>into the hour and 50 minute and two hour mark.</p>
<p>That simply reflects my enthusiasm</p>
<p>and excitement about these topics</p>
<p>and my desire to give you as much information</p>
<p>as I possibly can in each episode.</p>
<p>Please remember, you don&rsquo;t have to listen</p>
<p>to the whole episode all at once.</p>
<p>Everything is timestamped.</p>
<p>Everything is captioned in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>The captions take a few days on YouTube.</p>
<p>We apologize for that,</p>
<p>but in order to have them done correctly,</p>
<p>it takes a few days after it&rsquo;s posted.</p>
<p>So if you need those captions,</p>
<p>please check back maybe 24 or 48 hours</p>
<p>after the episodes are released.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re enjoying this podcast and the information,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re finding it beneficial,</p>
<p>there are a couple of things that you can do</p>
<p>that are totally zero cost that really help us</p>
<p>and help you get this information going forward.</p>
<p>One is, if you don&rsquo;t already subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>please do subscribe.</p>
<p>We release episodes every Monday</p>
<p>and hopefully soon more often than that,</p>
<p>shorter episodes as well.</p>
<p>But every Monday we release an episode,</p>
<p>please do subscribe.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already subscribe on Apple and Spotify,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very beneficial.</p>
<p>Please do that.</p>
<p>That helps us as well.</p>
<p>If you could give us a five-star review on Apple,</p>
<p>if you feel that that&rsquo;s what we deserve.</p>
<p>And Apple also gives you the opportunity</p>
<p>to give us comments, feedback about the episodes.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions about episodes,</p>
<p>feedback of any kind,</p>
<p>please put it in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>Routinely throughout the week</p>
<p>after the release of each episode,</p>
<p>I cover content in shorter format</p>
<p>and in more depth on Instagram at Huberman Lab.</p>
<p>Every episode is also indexed and searchable</p>
<p>in the search function on our website, hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also where we post links to various studies</p>
<p>and downloadable protocols, all zero cost.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, you can search for different topics</p>
<p>and it will bring you to the particular episodes</p>
<p>that contain the information on those topics.</p>
<p>As well, if you&rsquo;d like to support us,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>The sponsors that we discussed</p>
<p>at the beginning of the podcast</p>
<p>are a vital way to keep the information</p>
<p>being distributed at zero cost to everybody.</p>
<p>We only work with sponsors that we really love their products</p>
<p>and that we really respect the people</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re working with there.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s no obligation</p>
<p>to purchase or to even check out those sponsors,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re in a position to do so,</p>
<p>that really does help us.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>And last but not least,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your time and attention today.</p>
<p>Your willingness to learn about vision</p>
<p>in the visual system and the various things</p>
<p>that you can do to help support the health</p>
<p>and functioning of your visual system.</p>
<p>And of course, I want to thank you</p>
<p>for your interest in science.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll see you next time.</p>
