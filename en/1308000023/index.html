    <p>Now wait, Vlad, you have to turn your camera off. And then I&rsquo;m going to do my little bit where the</p>
<p>bestie guesting door knocks. Oh, no, Jason. No, that&rsquo;s not silly. This is silly. Here we go.</p>
<p>But I can do it. It&rsquo;s very easy for me. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Don&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>these guys don&rsquo;t want to do it. They don&rsquo;t like my they don&rsquo;t like my bets.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the all in podcast with us again,</p>
<p>the queen of Kinwa himself, David Friedberg, the rain man. Definitely counting cards. Yeah.</p>
<p>Burn baby David Sacks is with us. Chamath Palihapitiya, the dictator.</p>
<p>By the way, and by the way, go ahead, Jekyll. I&rsquo;m Jekyll, aka baby seal.</p>
<p>Jekyll, could you take longer with the intros? I mean, this is like,</p>
<p>this is like your one moment to shine at the intros.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fucking torture. I know.</p>
<p>I like to do a little branding here. I&rsquo;m branding you guys as characters on the show.</p>
<p>I do want to I do want to give a big shout out and congratulations for David Friedberg.</p>
<p>Wedding is beak in a big way. The story, by the way, we should actually have founder</p>
<p>crazy founder stories and we should have Friedberg tell the story of Metro Mile, but it closed its</p>
<p>SPAC transaction and went public and it&rsquo;s doing great. And congratulations.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Well, golf clap. Thank you. Thank you. Very nice. And joining us this week as our second</p>
<p>bestie guestie after a triumphant performance by Draymond Green on the last all in podcast</p>
<p>is Vlad Tenev, who is the co founder and CEO of a new startup. We wanted to introduce everybody</p>
<p>to it&rsquo;s called Robin Hood. Vlad, tell everybody what is Robin Hood and what&rsquo;s the mission of this</p>
<p>new startup you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve got. Thank you for for having me having me here hanging with you guys.</p>
<p>Robin Hood&rsquo;s mission is to democratize finance for all. It&rsquo;s somewhat new. We&rsquo;ve been around</p>
<p>for a little bit over five years and we have a mobile app and a website that allows customers to</p>
<p>invest in stocks, options, cryptocurrencies. We offer a debit card and a high yield savings</p>
<p>product as well. Commission free and with no account minimums. Vlad, I think you&rsquo;ve done an</p>
<p>amazing job building this company and you guys have done an amazing job democratizing access to</p>
<p>the ability to trade. Can we fast let&rsquo;s fast forward to the issue that I mean, this</p>
<p>we discussed, I guess, a few pods ago because there was intense interest in this. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our highest rated pod ever was discussing the GameStop issue. So you had these these traders</p>
<p>from Wall Street bets, these Redditors who, like you said, they perceive themselves as the heirs</p>
<p>to occupy Wall Street. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re trading for profit, also for revenge. And and then,</p>
<p>you know, you guys, I guess, get a call in the middle of the night from the clearing house and</p>
<p>you have to freeze the buy side of the trade the next day. I guess let&rsquo;s fast forward to that</p>
<p>because that was the thing that, you know, got everybody up in arms. Could you, I guess,</p>
<p>talk to us about kind of what happened? And I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t want to have to freeze trading,</p>
<p>right? But you are being compelled by this clearing house. Can you kind of explain what</p>
<p>they told you and why you had to do it? And why not just ask them to give you the order in writing</p>
<p>so you can post on your website so everybody would know you didn&rsquo;t have a choice? Is that</p>
<p>something you could have done? Well, I think the challenge was that no doubt we could have</p>
<p>communicated this a little bit better to customers. Right. By the time by the time we restricted</p>
<p>these securities to PCO and it was 13 securities that we limited to sell only, that process is</p>
<p>actually operationalized within Robinhood. So it&rsquo;s we do it from time to time under various</p>
<p>circumstances like corporate actions. So when something has a reverse stock split or something</p>
<p>like that, we can PCO it for a little bit. So there&rsquo;s a button in a dashboard that, you know,</p>
<p>you can click and automated emails get sent out. So it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an operational process that I think</p>
<p>in hindsight we probably should have exceptionalized to to make it to make it clear why we were doing</p>
<p>this, just given all the swirl around all these meme stocks online. But as soon as those emails</p>
<p>went out, the conspiracy theories immediately started started coming. So my phone was blowing</p>
<p>up with, you know, how could you do this? How could you be on the side of the hedge funds?</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;re not on the side of the hedge funds. I mean, we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re building products for</p>
<p>our customers. And we just had to do what we did to meet our deposit requirements, because</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t do that, we would be in violation. And the consequences of that could have been much,</p>
<p>much worse than simply holding buying in the 13 stocks.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where you know, when you were on CNBC with Sorkin, people either thought you</p>
<p>were obfuscating or you were lying. You know, and part of it is sort of the the guts of your</p>
<p>business is that at some point as well, you guys decided to self clear, right? And then going into</p>
<p>self clearing, you become liable for every single trade that happens on your platform.</p>
<p>Like, if you look back on those two weeks, what self clearing means, it means that, you know,</p>
<p>typically, you can work with a wholesaler to offload the risk. So Vlad acts as a transaction</p>
<p>layer and as a UI, and somebody else is responsible. At some point, these guys,</p>
<p>for economic reasons, decided to take that responsibility on themselves. But when you do</p>
<p>that, you take on the full fledged liability of the value of every single trade on behalf</p>
<p>of your customers. Yeah, I would think about it, I would explain it as there&rsquo;s like pre trade,</p>
<p>right? Then the trade and then post trade. So Robinhood obviously does pre trade with,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the app and what&rsquo;s called the introducing broker dealer, or market makers do the trade.</p>
<p>So we route it to, you know, all the firms like Citadel execution services to Sigma,</p>
<p>and then Robinhood securities does the post trade, the clearance and settlement. So we manage</p>
<p>the exchange of cash and stocks that happens on t plus two. So two days after the trade is made.</p>
<p>So what was not I mean, if you had to give that answer again, when Sorkin said,</p>
<p>you have a liquidity issue? Was the answer? Yes, we have a liquidity issue. And here&rsquo;s why?</p>
<p>Or is it still the same answer? It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I stand by what I said, and I&rsquo;ll explain it. And thank you, by the way,</p>
<p>for giving me a chance to explain it. First of all, restricting securities,</p>
<p>restricting the buying of securities is something that every pretty much every broker did to some</p>
<p>degree during this week, right? So when you say the L word and financial services,</p>
<p>it reminds you of Lehman Brothers, where you literally are not able to operate your business.</p>
<p>We met all of our deposit requirements. The new capital that we raised, the 3.4 billion,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t to meet our ongoing deposit requirements. We had met them. And in order to relax them</p>
<p>and eventually unrestrict them, we needed to raise some more capital and eventually have</p>
<p>more cushion so that if we keep seeing the type of growth that we kept seeing,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have to impose position limits again. So I stand by what I said. I think if you describe</p>
<p>that as the L word, pretty much every broker would have had that issue. And I think at that</p>
<p>point, the word kind of loses its meaning and the gotcha factor that the journalists are trying to</p>
<p>get out of it. Do you think that the risk in the business went up when you decided to self-clear,</p>
<p>or would this risk have been the same if you worked through a wholesaler?</p>
<p>Well, I think a lot of the other brokers who relied on clearing firms had the same issue,</p>
<p>right? There&rsquo;s firms like Apex Clearing, which has introducing brokers. Cash App, for example,</p>
<p>clears through a third party as well. And they all had this issue. And of course, their response was</p>
<p>they kind of threw their clearing firm under the bus. So obviously, we&rsquo;re not going to do that</p>
<p>because our clearing firm is Robinhood Securities. But I think understanding the space a little bit</p>
<p>better since Robinhood Securities is a subsidiary of my company, I realized these clearing firms</p>
<p>had to do what they did. It&rsquo;s non-negotiable to meet your deposit requirements. Of course,</p>
<p>we can ask, what can we do? Are these deposit requirements sensical? What can we do to drive</p>
<p>change in the system? And I think that&rsquo;s where my&hellip; Who sets those?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that? Who sets those requirements? That&rsquo;s the clearing house, right? Is that the DTCC?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the DTCC. And a lot of this stuff is actually spelled out in Dodd-Frank. So if</p>
<p>you look at Dodd-Frank, you&rsquo;ll see descriptions of the VAR charge and the various special charges</p>
<p>there. But I do think one thing that I&rsquo;m very excited about is not going beyond just talking</p>
<p>about our problems, right? I&rsquo;ve talked about our problems a lot, but talking about solutions and</p>
<p>how we can create a better financial system in the future. And I really think if you understand</p>
<p>the underbelly of what T plus 2 settlement is, you immediately ask yourself, why aren&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>settling trades in real time? And I wrote a post on that. I had a tweet storm. I&rsquo;d also say some</p>
<p>of the feedback that I&rsquo;ve gotten is, here&rsquo;s Vlad from Robinhood telling us about trying to change</p>
<p>T plus 2 so that he can meet, he can lower his deposit requirements. I think there&rsquo;s lots of</p>
<p>other systemic issues that fall out of that. In particular, right now you can short sell more</p>
<p>a stock than the shares that are outstanding, right? So some of these stocks had 140% short</p>
<p>interest, right? So more shares were shorted than actually outstanding. And I just think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pathological. And it stems from the fact that these shares are tracked on pieces of paper.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re basically not tracked and someone can – I can lend you my shares. You can short them.</p>
<p>The person that&rsquo;s buying them from you can lend them again and you can do that multiple times</p>
<p>and you end up with this situation that could destabilize the financial markets, right?</p>
<p>Okay, so moving from T plus 2 to T plus 0, that&rsquo;s one issue. Where do you think margin?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I was going to ask. Where is your margin?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts on margin?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, so margin wasn&rsquo;t involved in this particular situation. In fact,</p>
<p>there was an escalation path. Not a lot of people noticed until Thursday, but</p>
<p>pretty much all the brokers, including Robinhood, were ratcheting up the margin requirements for</p>
<p>all of these securities until they got to 100%. So by the beginning of the week, they were pretty</p>
<p>much all at 100%, which means you can&rsquo;t use margin to buy them. You have to have them 100% covered.</p>
<p>So do you guys have a more specific question on margin?</p>
<p>Well, I meant more like – so for example, I think it&rsquo;s true, but you tell me if this is not true.</p>
<p>You guys paid like a $65 million fine to the SEC for gamifying Robinhood, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly true, but go ahead.</p>
<p>Okay. Do you want to just tell us what the truth is?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, so the fine wasn&rsquo;t for gamifying Robinhood. It was for payment for order flow</p>
<p>and business model related things. The gamification one is the Massachusetts</p>
<p>securities one, which is a separate thing. And look, on the SEC thing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a fast growing company. We obviously scaled a lot between the period in question.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Securities and Exchange Commission felt like we could have done things better. And</p>
<p>I own that. I think that we&rsquo;re fine being held to higher standards. We have to hold ourselves to</p>
<p>higher standards. And what we can do is just do some of the things we&rsquo;ve done. Staff up our</p>
<p>compliance team, staff up our legal team. We brought on a new chief legal officer who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>former SEC commissioner, two new chief compliance officers for Robinhood Securities and Financial</p>
<p>who had decades of experience and the level to which we&rsquo;re investing in compliance. I mean,</p>
<p>the goal is to build the finest legal and compliance team that the financial industry has</p>
<p>seen. Let me tie it back flat to what we were talking about before. So do you think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay, if we&rsquo;re trying to build a generation of investors, to give them access to margin</p>
<p>as easily as some apps, including Robinhood does, and then separately allows them to trade</p>
<p>highly transactional high vol instruments like options. On top of that with margin,</p>
<p>what do you think about that just as a general philosophy, forget business building for a second?</p>
<p>Well, and then also, can you say what the margin you allow is for a new account? Because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think people understand what that is. Maybe a little definition there.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a couple of things I want to clear up. Number one, you can&rsquo;t trade options on margin.</p>
<p>So options are all fully paid for. Margin is not suitable for everyone. I&rsquo;ll admit that. You have</p>
<p>to understand it. And you also have to be a Robinhood Gold customer, which means you have</p>
<p>to sign up and pay $5 a month. Most brokers don&rsquo;t gate margin behind a premium offering.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re already a little bit more restrictive on that front. You have to have $2,000 in your</p>
<p>account before you can borrow. And in December, we did lower our margin rates to 2.5%, which is a</p>
<p>very competitive low rate. But let me tell you a use case for margin that I actually think is quite</p>
<p>powerful. So obviously, one use case is kind of the typical one of buying more stock with your</p>
<p>money. But if you build a large portfolio, you can actually use margin as a line of credit.</p>
<p>And we offer this feature with our debit card. You can turn on what&rsquo;s called margin spending.</p>
<p>And what that means is if you invest in your portfolio, you can borrow collateralized by</p>
<p>your portfolio at a very low rate, which is one-tenth of what you would borrow</p>
<p>through a credit card. So I actually think it&rsquo;s a powerful tool. Certainly,</p>
<p>customers have to understand it and be suitable for it. But it unlocks a type of borrowing,</p>
<p>not just for buying stocks, but for meeting your daily purchasing needs that I think is very useful.</p>
<p>If somebody puts $2,000 in Vlad, can they trade $4,000, $6,000, $8,000? And does it</p>
<p>matter what equities they&rsquo;re holding? How does it work?</p>
<p>Yeah, the actual calculations are – there&rsquo;s no blanket formula I can give you because it does</p>
<p>depend on the securities that you buy. So the example I gave was, for example, GME and some</p>
<p>of these other meme stocks. We raise the requirement on those to 100%. So those have</p>
<p>to be fully paid for. Other stocks have an initial requirement as low as 25% if it&rsquo;s one that is</p>
<p>deemed by the operational staff and our processes as not being super volatile. And it can go in</p>
<p>between. So 25% initial requirement all the way up to 100%.</p>
<p>So you can trade four times your money if it&rsquo;s a really blue-chip, secure stock?</p>
<p>More or less, yeah, with some nuance around that.</p>
<p>Time and again, Vlad, there are studies that show that it&rsquo;s really difficult to beat the market and</p>
<p>make money trading in an efficient market like the market we have for stocks or options or what</p>
<p>have you. There&rsquo;s a lot of players. There&rsquo;s a lot of liquidity. There&rsquo;s a lot of people with</p>
<p>information. It&rsquo;s these great fund managers over time underperform just the S&amp;P, right?</p>
<p>And I think I mentioned this when we had that pod a few ago that I was involved in a Forex</p>
<p>trading company and 60% of accounts eventually ran out of money. Can you share with us what</p>
<p>percent of Robinhood accounts run out of money? And do we mask generally, and I&rsquo;m not accusing</p>
<p>Robinhood specifically of this, but do we mask the idea of investing in businesses</p>
<p>as a way of hiding that people are really just using this to trade in and out and try and make</p>
<p>money in the short term? And ultimately, the majority of them end up losing most of their</p>
<p>money because the fees and the spread and the margin or whatever it is that kind of adds up,</p>
<p>wipes out the account. That&rsquo;s what I saw at this Forex company I was involved in.</p>
<p>Can you share with us in a very candid way how many accounts do eventually go bankrupt at Robinhood</p>
<p>and how much of that do you really see? First of all, I&rsquo;d say Forex is a little bit</p>
<p>different because the leverage you get in Forex is like orders of magnitude higher.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll admit to that. It was like 10 to 50 to 1 leverage. So you&rsquo;re totally right. Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>So I do think the businesses are a little bit different. Most of our customers don&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>leverage. Most of our customers aren&rsquo;t active traders or trading options. And if you look at</p>
<p>some of the features that we&rsquo;ve rolled out, the theme of this year has been how do you turn a</p>
<p>first time investor into a long term investor? So fractional shares, recurring investments, drip.</p>
<p>These tools allow someone to create a diversified portfolio of individual stocks and</p>
<p>recurringly buy into them over time. But is that the majority of users today or the minority?</p>
<p>How many accounts do you see cycle down to zero over what period of time?</p>
<p>I think a very small percentage of accounts have that property. I mean, I think if you look back</p>
<p>in 2020, we had a huge increase in growth and interest in investing right at the bottom of</p>
<p>the market crash in March. And I think people have taken advantage of that. And our customers</p>
<p>in general have benefited from the recovery very, very significantly. So I would reject the meme</p>
<p>that Robinhood customers are active traders that are just churning their accounts and losing all</p>
<p>of their money. That&rsquo;s just simply not what we&rsquo;re seeing. I know Sachs has a question,</p>
<p>but one question I had with the conspiracy there is that I would just love to hear a yes,</p>
<p>no to. Sure.</p>
<p>Did Citadel call you and say, stop this madness, because they had exposure through one of their</p>
<p>hedge funds with GameStop? And did Sequoia call you and say, hey, stop this madness?</p>
<p>Or Joe Biden, you forgot the White House one. No, no. This was a formulaic decision</p>
<p>made by Robinhood Securities due to deposit requirements.</p>
<p>So Citadel didn&rsquo;t call and ask. Sequoia didn&rsquo;t call and ask.</p>
<p>Did the SEC call you and say this has to stop?</p>
<p>No. But the clearinghouse did, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, they called and they said, here are the deposit requirements,</p>
<p>and we worked with them to lower the risk so that we could meet the deposit requirement.</p>
<p>Got it. And so just let me pick up on that. So at the same time that was happening,</p>
<p>and I know this wasn&rsquo;t Robinhood, this is not your company, but Discord and Reddit were receiving</p>
<p>reports that the WallStreetBets forum was engaged in hate speech. And there was an organized effort</p>
<p>to get them censored and taken down. And Discord basically fell for it and took down WallStreetBets.</p>
<p>Reddit, to their credit, did not. Do you have a take on what happened there? And I mean,</p>
<p>I assume you don&rsquo;t think WallStreetBets was engaged in hate speech.</p>
<p>Well, so that happened Wednesday, I believe. And yeah, we were watching it. It was first,</p>
<p>it was like, oh, wow, Discord, Discord shut down. And then I think WallStreetBets</p>
<p>went dark on Reddit for a little bit as well, but I&rsquo;m not quite sure of the reasoning behind that.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I disavow hate speech, misinformation. I&rsquo;m not, you know, judging</p>
<p>which of the posts are hate speech or not. I think that&rsquo;s the social media companies that</p>
<p>should take a look at that. The mods, I think the mods closed down Reddit for like,</p>
<p>a little bit and then turned it back on. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, a lot of these things get triggered</p>
<p>if 10 people reported at the same time, it just, it sets off a circuit breaker.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems to me that, and certainly this is, if you want to call it a conspiracy theory,</p>
<p>it seemed like you had this WallStreetBets group, they were on one side of the trade,</p>
<p>you had these WallStreet hedge funds that are on the other side of the trade.</p>
<p>And there was an effort to weaponize the speech rules of Reddit and Discord to cut off the lines</p>
<p>of communication of WallStreetBets. Because the only way that WallStreetBets as a decentralized</p>
<p>group of millions of traders can stick together and compete with these hedge funds is if they</p>
<p>can communicate with each other by these services. And so, you know, it seems like there was an</p>
<p>organized effort to try and take them down at the exact same time that they were frozen out</p>
<p>of the buy side of the trade. Vlad, do you think that there should be</p>
<p>more transparency in the financial markets, meaning everything from payment for order flow,</p>
<p>how much money companies make lending out their stock, which company is short, which stock,</p>
<p>which company is long, which stock on a more frequent basis, how much margin people are</p>
<p>running? Do you think like we should move to perfect transparency in the financial markets?</p>
<p>I do think that there should be more transparency. And I&rsquo;m glad you brought up payment for order flow</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m trying to take on. You guys might have noticed I published a</p>
<p>post on payment for order flow. I started a tweet storm that is meant to just start the conversation</p>
<p>around it. I want to understand kind of the misconceptions and the theories and knock them</p>
<p>out one by one. And I think that&rsquo;ll lead to some positive discourse around it. And there certainly</p>
<p>might be things that&rsquo;ll have to change. And I think that the first step is actually engaging</p>
<p>in the conversation and kind of connecting the people that understand the details with the people</p>
<p>that have issues with it. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s been happening enough. So for sure.</p>
<p>But what about stuff like margin shorting, you know, short, like, do you think that we</p>
<p>should move all of this stuff so that it&rsquo;s just out out front for everybody to see?</p>
<p>Well, I think I think if we if we migrate to a better settlement infrastructure</p>
<p>and move to real time settlement, you get a lot of that stuff for free. Right. So you do get and</p>
<p>I know a lot of the crypto people came out after I published my post and said, you know, crypto</p>
<p>solves this. You could just put it on on a block chain and everyone could see publicly what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on and which share which shares are being being held short where they are, who&rsquo;s owning them.</p>
<p>So I think I would be in favor of more transparency. I&rsquo;m not sure at what point</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of like negative secondary effects. I haven&rsquo;t kind of unspun the thread fully,</p>
<p>but I think we can we can keep taking it one step at a time and see more transparency generally,</p>
<p>I think, is much better. Hey, Vlad, when you guys go public,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about having a listing at some point here soon. Why would you not have all</p>
<p>of your shares sold in the IPO through Robinhood to your retail users? Why would you sell any</p>
<p>shares to institutional investors? Wow, good question.</p>
<p>It is an interesting question. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one that I probably that&rsquo;s probably the one I can&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>too much detail on. Hopefully you guys understand my recommendation, if you&rsquo;re going to democratize</p>
<p>access, do it all the way. Fuck the hedge funds and the big guys. If that&rsquo;s the if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point and you give retail equal access, you know, in all these transactions, as you know,</p>
<p>institutions get get all the access and the retail is paying the price.</p>
<p>Have your entire listing done through retail. It would be it would be a game changing transaction.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, I mean, a lot of this it&rsquo;s really interesting that this turned into,</p>
<p>you know, individuals versus hedge funds, because I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful story.</p>
<p>But you also have large institutions like Fidelity that are holders of all these stocks,</p>
<p>right? You have individuals on a lot of platforms that were short selling them</p>
<p>as well. Not Robinhood, because Robinhood actually doesn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t allow short selling</p>
<p>by individuals. But a lot of the other brokers do. And you have you had statistics, statistics</p>
<p>coming out that actually show retail versus institutional. And, you know, there was some</p>
<p>counterintuitive results. So I think if you actually look deep into the plumbing, the story</p>
<p>of, you know, long individuals, short institutions on opposite sides, I think there&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>more nuance to it than that. Vlad, if you had to do it over, or actually forget about the past,</p>
<p>think about the future. What do you change inside the company?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see. I think the 3.4 billion in extra capital certainly helps. I think I&rsquo;m very proud</p>
<p>of the transition that we made between Thursday and Friday. So Thursday, we had the blunt hammer</p>
<p>of PCOing these stocks, right, which obviously was not ideal. By Friday, we had moved to a much</p>
<p>more sophisticated system where intraday we adjust the position limits in, it was up to 50 stocks,</p>
<p>and we published that on our website. So that that gave us a lot more granular control over it</p>
<p>and is a better system. And we&rsquo;re going to only improve that and kind of take the learnings to</p>
<p>other parts of the business. So I think the great thing about, you know, these sorts of crises is</p>
<p>sort of months and years worth of work get compressed and people are just like super</p>
<p>aligned on the key priorities we need to do to move the business forward. And we saw that.</p>
<p>And then the third thing I&rsquo;d put is just maybe you guys have seen, you know, I feel like I</p>
<p>evolved as the chief executive and as a leader, I didn&rsquo;t used to be on social media telling our</p>
<p>story very much. But I&rsquo;m out there trying to encourage more transparent, I would say much</p>
<p>better today than with Elon, much better with Elon than Sorkin. So progress has been made. I have</p>
<p>just a basic question. I know we got to wrap soon when things get superheated, and you have this</p>
<p>viral momentum where I don&rsquo;t know how many people tried to sign up on that day. But maybe you could</p>
<p>give us an idea on that Wednesday or Thursday, was it, you know, five figures, six figures or</p>
<p>seven figures worth of new accounts? Why not throttle the new accounts and say, hey, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the waitlist, we onboard 10,000 people a day, your day is going to be next Thursday,</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t get caught in this. You know, everybody uses the fact that it&rsquo;s friction free</p>
<p>to sign up to do an emotional bat in a, you know, let&rsquo;s call it mob behavior, right? Like,</p>
<p>this turned into a mob. And I guess some people believe it&rsquo;s a good mob to go up against the</p>
<p>hedge funds. But it could have equally been something, you know, something more deranged,</p>
<p>and even more edge case is going to happen. So when that does happen, and a million or 10 million</p>
<p>people sign up, can&rsquo;t you just pause it and say, we&rsquo;re not going to do any new accounts today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve reached our limit. We actually did do that. So we have been pausing new account approvals</p>
<p>off and on, depending on on the load. And, you know, customers have been experiencing,</p>
<p>in some cases, short delays, with account approvals, obviously not an ideal solution</p>
<p>from our standpoint. But, you know, if we have to do that, we will do it. And we have done it.</p>
<p>How many people signed up on that Wednesday, like just ballpark,</p>
<p>like, was it hundreds of 1000s? Millions? Jason, are we are we running an ad for Robinhood? Stop?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just glad last night. None of us cares. None of us cares. flat last question.</p>
<p>Hit me. Hey, listen, if you had to pick two different CEOs reactions to how you dealt with</p>
<p>it, let&rsquo;s say Tim Cook on one end of the spectrum and Zuck on the other. How do you think they would</p>
<p>score what Robinhood did and what they are doing? Tim Zuckerberg?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not sure. I think that</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m proud of, of how the firm navigated this. I think, obviously, there&rsquo;s ways to improve</p>
<p>upon it. I think that, you know, anytime you get a phone call in the middle of the night saying you</p>
<p>have to put up $3 billion, all sorts of things run through your head, right? I&rsquo;ve had it happen. I</p>
<p>know. And that was just money from the cage for poker. I got a lot of people reaching out to me.</p>
<p>I got a lot of people reaching out to me, which was amazing.</p>
<p>If you had to do it over again, why not just post a blog that morning saying,</p>
<p>hey, we got a call in the middle of the night, we have to do this. Is that is that the thing you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>do over again? No, because he&rsquo;d be throwing his own company under the bus. He&rsquo;d have to say</p>
<p>Robinhood Securities is telling Robinhood the broker to post this money because Robinhood</p>
<p>Securities is being told by their downstream clearing. So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>a possible situation. But you&rsquo;re saying it now. So better to say it at the time it all happened</p>
<p>and it would have diffused the whole crisis, right? Well, first of all, I&rsquo;m not throwing</p>
<p>anyone under the bus. We did. The team did what they had to do. I don&rsquo;t think there was any way</p>
<p>to navigate that differently. I think the automated emails that went out to customers saying</p>
<p>your stocks are you&rsquo;re restricted from buying these stocks probably could have been handled a</p>
<p>little bit better. We probably could have offered more detail into that with the foresight that</p>
<p>maybe customers would think that a hedge fund forced us to do it or something like that.</p>
<p>So certainly, certainly there&rsquo;s areas we can improve upon across the board. And</p>
<p>when an early investor called me throughout this and said, hey, chin up, you know, navigating a</p>
<p>crisis successfully unlocks the next level of value creation for the company. And I&rsquo;ve had that</p>
<p>in mind the entire time. And I&rsquo;m just doing what I can to to make that for sure a reality,</p>
<p>both for Robin Hood and for the financial system. I think that this could lead to some</p>
<p>really positive change industry wide. Yeah. And I&rsquo;ll just this one last softball here.</p>
<p>This is not about what happened that with GameStop. We&rsquo;ve had a debate on this pod.</p>
<p>It got kind of heated between Chamath and Jason about the nature of Jason&rsquo;s investment in Robin</p>
<p>Hood. Can you tell us, can you tell us your side of the story of what happened at Antonio&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Nuthouse and how much how much stumbling was involved precisely? Okay. I&rsquo;m very glad you</p>
<p>brought this up because I&rsquo;ve been meaning to call Jason out on it. He has this great story of how,</p>
<p>you know, we met at Antonio&rsquo;s Nuthouse and he wrote a check. I think that the real story is that</p>
<p>on Robin Hood launch day, which was a Saturday, and we violated every rule of PR and marketing by</p>
<p>launching inadvertently on a Saturday. I got a reach out from from Launch, who was one of the</p>
<p>first one of the first outlets to cover our launch on Saturday. And Jason&rsquo;s friend, Simon,</p>
<p>ex-employee who ended up running social for us for a bit, was a big fan of Robin Hood. So</p>
<p>he joined us as kind of our first social person. He introduced me to Jason. I met Jason at Sequoia,</p>
<p>Jason, where you agreed to invest. And then six months later, we met at Antonio&rsquo;s Nuthouse when</p>
<p>we were raising our Series A. And I think you gave me the advice to go with Index Ventures.</p>
<p>No, no, I said Sequoia all the way. Don&rsquo;t get me in trouble. I&rsquo;m team Sequoia. I promised. Michael</p>
<p>Moritz, Doug Leone, whoever&rsquo;s watching, I told them Sequoia. Sequoia was great. They unfortunately</p>
<p>passed on our Series A, as did a lot of other funds. Ouch. Wow. All right, listen, thanks for</p>
<p>coming on the pod. We really appreciate you taking the time and continued success. Vlad, I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>glad we didn&rsquo;t give you a job offer back in 2008. Sounds like it was the right move for you.</p>
<p>Funny how things worked out. Yeah, apparently I interviewed him in 2008 for a job and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the job. It was you and Alex. Alex Michalka was my main interviewer. But it&rsquo;s funny, I</p>
<p>graduated with a math degree, right? I was doing pure math, which in 2008 made me unemployable.</p>
<p>We were the only people hiring at that point. Yeah, yeah. You were the only people that would</p>
<p>interview me. Yeah. Everyone else was like, where&rsquo;s your computer science degree? Can you</p>
<p>code? So I ended up going to math grad school, which was one of the few options that I had,</p>
<p>and ended up dropping out, and here I am. So funny how things work. Well, good for you.</p>
<p>All right, continued success, and thanks for coming on the pod. We&rsquo;ll see you soon.</p>
<p>Thanks, Vlad. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Wait, Vlad&rsquo;s back? Wait, Vlad&rsquo;s back. Sorry, I thought I was supposed to leave. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you guys want to meet. No, you can stay. I was saying, you can stay. I was saying after</p>
<p>a year of Jason asking us to run ads, he&rsquo;s found a way of trying to make this a 45-minute</p>
<p>infomercial for Robinhood. Absolutely. Listen, I&rsquo;m ride or die, Vlad. You know that. I&rsquo;m ride</p>
<p>or die with my founders. I didn&rsquo;t ask for that and I don&rsquo;t need it. We&rsquo;re just trying to keep</p>
<p>everything up and let all the people safely in who have been banging on our door.</p>
<p>How much have you been sleeping, Vlad? Have you been able to sleep? I mean, this has got to be</p>
<p>exhausting. Oh, my God. Really? Can you ask him something like at least semi-fucking challenging?</p>
<p>Honestly. That&rsquo;s not my job. That&rsquo;s why you guys are here. If you&rsquo;re walking down the road and a</p>
<p>Robinhood customer, this is a tough one. I&rsquo;m sorry. You thought you were over this, but you</p>
<p>logged yourself back in. So, and a Robinhood customer that lost all this money when they</p>
<p>got locked out of trading that day comes up to you and screams and cries, I lost all my money.</p>
<p>What do you say to him? I got completely destroyed. My life savings is wiped out. I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a bunch of these comments on different boards and so on. What do you say? Because I know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tough one to swallow. And I know that we&rsquo;ve heard the story around what happened. But</p>
<p>what do you say to that person? Well, first of all, I&rsquo;d be very, very empathetic. I probably</p>
<p>want to understand how someone could lose money when they couldn&rsquo;t buy a stock at the all-time</p>
<p>high. So, I think the details around that, I mean, if you look back, and obviously this had</p>
<p>nothing to do with the decision, right? But Thursday was the all-time high.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. But the reason for that is because the ability of Wall Street bets to continue the trade</p>
<p>was basically interrupted, right? They were engaged in a short squeeze against these big hedge funds.</p>
<p>And in order for this to keep driving the squeeze up and up and up, they needed it</p>
<p>basically to be able to buy. And then once they got frozen out of all the online broker accounts,</p>
<p>not just you guys, but all of them, that broke the trade, right?</p>
<p>Maybe. I mean, hypothetically.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what they were so upset about is because they got locked out of the buy side</p>
<p>of the trade. They weren&rsquo;t locked out of the sell side, right? They got locked out of the buy side.</p>
<p>And that allowed the big hedge funds 24 hours to regroup and cover the trade. The price went down.</p>
<p>And that basically cracked the whole thing, right?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure about the exact details there on the hedge fund side or what happened. Look,</p>
<p>what I can say is we&rsquo;re going to do our best to make sure that we get better and we serve</p>
<p>our customers whenever they want to buy stocks. And we&rsquo;ll do that and we&rsquo;re going to get better</p>
<p>and better every day. And the truth is, if you had had the money in the bank account to for DTCC to</p>
<p>be compliant, you would have been like you weren&rsquo;t trying. I mean, you&rsquo;re in the business of letting</p>
<p>people without question. Yeah. Yeah. You make nothing if people stop trading, you need people</p>
<p>to trade. It&rsquo;s the core of the business, right? Yeah, this wasn&rsquo;t, you know, a value judgment or</p>
<p>some kind of moral stance. And we weren&rsquo;t pressured into doing it by anything other than our regulatory</p>
<p>deposit requirements. What do you think is the future of payment for order flow and revenue</p>
<p>sharing on sort of like the ways in which like meaning, how much do you think of that payment</p>
<p>for order flow revenue? Should you share with customers? Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question. I mean,</p>
<p>this is all highly regulated, and it&rsquo;s become the industry standard business model, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re excited to have a conversation about it. I do think exchanges</p>
<p>are here to stay. Market making is here to stay. Market making is a profitable enterprise. And so</p>
<p>some level of revenue share between the market maker and the broker makes sense. And it is</p>
<p>regulated. So I&rsquo;m not quite sure what if any changes need to come, but hopefully this will</p>
<p>be part of the conversation that we can help create and work through. I think part of the</p>
<p>problem is just the opacity of it. You know, it&rsquo;s kind of like interchange. Does anyone know that</p>
<p>interchange is this sort of like hidden piece of revenue every time you transact with a debit card</p>
<p>or a credit card? It&rsquo;s sort of analogous in a way, right? Well, I think more people do just</p>
<p>because the technology companies that have come around, like, you know, Stripe and others will</p>
<p>eventually just try to take it to zero. And so if anything, I think what the business model,</p>
<p>or at least the business strategy of all these companies is when you find to your point, these</p>
<p>opaque pools of revenue, the innovation is just to give consumers power by taking these costs to zero.</p>
<p>If you Vlad decided tomorrow to do Robin Hood Pro, you know, higher level than gold and charge</p>
<p>50 bucks a month for 50 trades, and then $5 each trade after that would solve anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>misgivings about this, right? You could just offer both options.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s payment for order flow enabled commission free trading, right? It helps</p>
<p>cover the costs of the business that that that leads to our ability to offer commission free</p>
<p>trading. And moreover, it allows smaller investors to participate. So certainly, I think</p>
<p>that model would work, but the consequence would be smaller investors would not benefit, right?</p>
<p>If the option is there, it&rsquo;d be like Facebook saying we have an option for you to pay and not</p>
<p>see ads and be tracked, right? It would just be great option.</p>
<p>What do you think is the difference between investing and trading? And what do you think</p>
<p>has to happen so that, you know, back to where you started, if you want people to</p>
<p>close the inequality gap? How do you allow them to do it? Trading versus investing?</p>
<p>Well, I think the difference between trading and investing, investing is a little bit more</p>
<p>about accumulation. So typically, you&rsquo;re buying more stock and building up positions over time.</p>
<p>Trading comes into play. I think when when you&rsquo;re selling, right, when you&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>sort of strategically, and you&rsquo;re doing it not driven by outside needs for the for the capital,</p>
<p>but more for for sort of like, intrinsic needs. So I think the question is, would we</p>
<p>would we ever prevent people from selling? Ideally not. I mean, people have various needs that</p>
<p>that they could have for getting out of positions. And I think as a platform, we have to allow for</p>
<p>that. Awesome. Your PR people are literally going to come freaking out breaking your glass in your</p>
<p>house. Your PR person is literally running from HQ. She&rsquo;s gonna be start banging on the back window,</p>
<p>you cannot be on the spot. Great job, Vlad. And remember, use the order code, bestie and get</p>
<p>kind of your first free month.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for having me, gentlemen.</p>
<p>All right. Thanks, man. Great job. Take care. Thanks. Thanks for answering our questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you for coming.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna log back in in 10 minutes, right?</p>
<p>Come back for the Chess of Budin and Gavin Newsome recall news,</p>
<p>your PR people will be delighted if you comment on that.</p>
<p>Are we going to do a debrief?</p>
<p>The debrief, from my opinion is that I think that there have they have to really tighten</p>
<p>two things. One is they need to make a decision. How do they want to make money? Because I think</p>
<p>this is the third time these issues have come up. It&rsquo;s probably not going to be the last</p>
<p>and because there&rsquo;s going to be more market volatility, not less. And so you just got to</p>
<p>decide how you want to make money because there is no amount of money that&rsquo;s possible. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to build a successful business and run into these margin constraints, right? You can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no amount of money that you could have. Meaning, if you look at the folks that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get called were folks that have like Schwab accounts. Why? Because Schwab is investing.</p>
<p>And if you look at the folks that did have these margin issues, because Robin Hood wasn&rsquo;t the only</p>
<p>one, they&rsquo;re all the trading and, and sort of like high frequency shops. And so, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a decision. And then it&rsquo;s back to what David said, which is like, once you make a decision,</p>
<p>you have to be able to tell people like, this is what you want to stand for. And you have to have</p>
<p>the right internal controls and governance. And so, you know, if he gets these things, right,</p>
<p>maybe they can be on the other side of it. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re just going to continually</p>
<p>step on this stuff. And I think that the, you know, if folks lose enough money, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be pretty upset. I think sounded to me like David. Freeberg, you had a good point about</p>
<p>offering the the Robin Hood consumer base, the ability to buy the shares, I think 100% of it</p>
<p>should go to the retail investors. He didn&rsquo;t say no. And he kind of I kind of got the inclination</p>
<p>that he was going to do that. 100% he will not. Yeah, this came out in the past where he said</p>
<p>they were going to offer some of the IPO shares to Robin Hood customers. And so that was a few</p>
<p>months ago. I think I said publicly on Twitter, why don&rsquo;t you offer all your shares to IPO</p>
<p>customers? Like why take any of them direct? I mean, could he technically become a clearinghouse</p>
<p>and IPO people, but then what is it like partnership in it? Yeah, like, why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just take, you know, if fidelity wants to buy shares, let them buy shares on the open market,</p>
<p>like all the retail customers are forced to do. And then the fidelity argument is, well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re buying 50 $100 million blocks at a time. So we don&rsquo;t want to have to be in the market doing</p>
<p>that. But the marginal cost of buying a single share versus the marginal cost of buying a million</p>
<p>shares is much, much higher. And you know, that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the challenge with, you know, with</p>
<p>retail access in financial markets that Robin Hood has set out to solve, as have many others.</p>
<p>And it would be a really powerful statement if they said, you know what, we&rsquo;re going to show</p>
<p>the world that the market can all go direct and be efficient, and actually make all of their IPO</p>
<p>shares available. And then you know what, if the big block trade guys want to buy some,</p>
<p>go ahead and buy it from the retail guys in the open market, or do 5050, you know,</p>
<p>offer everybody who&rsquo;s a Robin Hood shareholder, I just think that they would if they could fill</p>
<p>their demand, their demand on their book for their IPO from retail, do that. And let anyone</p>
<p>else let fidelity sign up for Robin Hood account and buy their shares through Robin Hood, you know,</p>
<p>like, the fact is, the big block buyers always get a discount, right? They pay wholesale pricing in</p>
<p>these markets. And that&rsquo;s also part of why it&rsquo;s so difficult for retail to actually find a footing.</p>
<p>And so it would be a really powerful statement for them to kind of go all the way. Sure,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost certain they&rsquo;re going to get some of the shares available in the IPO</p>
<p>to Robin Hood customer. It&rsquo;s a great, it&rsquo;s a great kind of, you know, publicity point,</p>
<p>but, but it would be really powerful if they shifted the whole the whole thing.</p>
<p>I mean, years ago, when I was at Google, we did the IPO, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember this,</p>
<p>but it was the first time we tried to do this Dutch auction. So the reverse pricing of anyone,</p>
<p>any individual, any retailer, and retail customer and any institution could bid on Google shares.</p>
<p>And then there was a clearing price that was hidden, everyone got their shares at the same</p>
<p>time. So there wasn&rsquo;t this order book that was built by going to the big guys that the banks</p>
<p>all know and love like Fidelity and Tiro and so on, selling a big discounted shares, it was a it</p>
<p>was a it was a true market auction. And the direct listing is the new model for this that totally</p>
<p>democratizes access to the shares, creates fair and transparent pricing for everyone. And so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t end up with these like discounted shares that pop 80% on day one. Okay, Saks, what is your</p>
<p>debrief on the Vlad appearance? So I think Vlad did a pretty good job handling our questions,</p>
<p>answering some B minus, answering some deflecting some, I think that look, I think I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>Vlad&rsquo;s a bad guy. I think he&rsquo;s a good guy. I think Robinhood wanted to do the right thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they had any reason to want to freeze their own users out of their accounts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they wanted to do what they did. I think that there was a little bit of a blind spot</p>
<p>there on his part in terms of understanding the consequences of that freeze out, right? Because</p>
<p>it did break the buy side of the trade for Wall Street bets. And then that that basically allowed</p>
<p>the hedge funds to recover. And that was that moment, you know, and so that was that was a</p>
<p>big deal. I think the consequences of that decision were a big deal. But it&rsquo;s a counterfactual,</p>
<p>right? We don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll never know. Of course, look, it was it was that Thursday,</p>
<p>where the short squeeze ended because Wall Street bets couldn&rsquo;t keep buying,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t keep engineering their side of the trade. Obviously, that&rsquo;s why it cracked,</p>
<p>right? And Robinhood was a big part of that whole thing collapsing. Now, it was going to collapse</p>
<p>at some point. There&rsquo;s no question that the air was going to go out of the balloon.</p>
<p>Right. But would it have gone to five or 600 is the question?</p>
<p>Yeah. But how much money the hedge funds were going to lose, whether they&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>busted out of the game for good, and who was going to get left holding the bag? Those were</p>
<p>all questions that got answered in a completely different way. Because Robinhood did what it did.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t believe that they had a choice. I think they did it because they were forced to do</p>
<p>it. But it did have huge consequences. I thought he did. He&rsquo;s doing a better</p>
<p>and better job explaining this highly technical stuff. And, you know, obviously, if they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talk about their IPO, that does tell you certain things. I don&rsquo;t have any inside information. But</p>
<p>he obviously there&rsquo;s thing what I get from this is there are things he can talk about,</p>
<p>and there are things he can&rsquo;t talk about, there might be either things with the IPO,</p>
<p>or things with confidentiality between them and some of these parties, like,</p>
<p>I have a feeling people are not allowed to talk about this DTCC and what goes on there.</p>
<p>Because there might be I would have liked that that was an area where I really wanted to hear</p>
<p>more details and get more clarity. Because, I mean, I believe that look, the order came down</p>
<p>in the middle of the night from the DTCC. Right. And so that&rsquo;s why I kept asking, why wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just say to the DTCC, give me that order in writing. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s allowed to</p>
<p>talk about them. Okay, fair enough. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m reading into it. And I don&rsquo;t think I think</p>
<p>it might be one of these non disclosures, where you can&rsquo;t mention the non disclosure,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve all been involved in. Maybe, but see, that was the heart of my question is if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ordered by somebody in the middle of the night to take an action that is, you know,</p>
<p>adversarial to your own users, well, I would ask them for that in writing and posted on your</p>
<p>website, posted on your blog, so to show that you don&rsquo;t have a choice. I mean, I believe that he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a choice. But why didn&rsquo;t he say that from the very beginning? Right? I mean, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what caused all the problems for them. Yeah. All right. They have folks everybody go to</p>
<p>the syndicate.com slash all in boys. I love you. I gotta go. Great job. Talk to you soon.</p>
<p>Talk to you guys later. Love you guys. Love you, bestie. All right. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time.</p>
<p>Bye bye rain man David</p>
<p>we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
