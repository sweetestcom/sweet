<p>Eric earth</p>
<p>hey guys we&rsquo;re back it&rsquo;s in the morning</p>
<p>9 o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;m here to take your calls</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do a little Q&amp;A I have so</p>
<p>many questions and I can&rsquo;t even get so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go right to the first column</p>
<p>all the way if you want to know the</p>
<p>number you can&rsquo;t see it eight six six</p>
<p>five six one four two nine two you have</p>
<p>a burning question you ever beg you look</p>
<p>at the top earning gave us a call</p>
<p>so Alejandro you are calling from</p>
<p>Michigan I think I remember your name</p>
<p>from a while ago you had a question uh</p>
<p>potassium go ahead yeah okay all right</p>
<p>okay and like having every day like yeah</p>
<p>the only thing is for certain people you</p>
<p>can increase or oxal√° long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing enough lemon juice to counter the</p>
<p>oxygens we have aqua and then you can</p>
<p>lock the stones possibly if you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>citrus like lemon juice juice and you</p>
<p>consume that a regular basis</p>
<p>should be fine so yeah then you can do</p>
<p>just is really healthy for you so yeah</p>
<p>hey Brooke you&rsquo;re on the air yeah paper</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so so let&rsquo;s start with the stevia</p>
<p>question you you you probably saw</p>
<p>somewhere where it causes infertility</p>
<p>yeah someone tells me that it does</p>
<p>called infinitely in large quantities is</p>
<p>that true good question so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>cover this so the first question I</p>
<p>always ask when people hear things like</p>
<p>that is who told you that do you</p>
<p>remember the person who told you that</p>
<p>yes it was a doctor he&rsquo;s a nutritionist</p>
<p>he actually does nutrition response</p>
<p>yeah and so when you hear something like</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of like bizarre how could</p>
<p>I like a stevia cause infertility you</p>
<p>want to find out where they heard it</p>
<p>from what research I&rsquo;ve never ever found</p>
<p>any connection of taking studio to</p>
<p>infertility at all it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>safe now the problem of stevia there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of times when you buy it it comes</p>
<p>with multiple dextran that&rsquo;s the big</p>
<p>problem so we want to stay away from</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one video that I did</p>
<p>recently someone made a comment and I</p>
<p>recommended stevia in the raw and then I</p>
<p>found out I actually that person</p>
<p>reminded me that I had multi duction so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending anything with multi</p>
<p>dextra in fact I don&rsquo;t even know and had</p>
<p>it in there until I looked at the label</p>
<p>so these things tend to creep up and ya</p>
<p>know it doesn&rsquo;t cause infertility so I</p>
<p>would like to see the reference and yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>where you got to find out the source and</p>
<p>really pull the string and see if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true then you had another question I</p>
<p>think you had about muscle response</p>
<p>testing nutrition response testing yes</p>
<p>have you ever done it is it real doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work or the fake yeah muscle response</p>
<p>testing I was developed by Fred Yulin</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who he came to my seminar I went to his</p>
<p>seminar I personally don&rsquo;t use muscle</p>
<p>response testing nutrition response</p>
<p>testing yeah I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t use it yeah</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use it I basically go by I take</p>
<p>your data I take your history take the</p>
<p>testing and I crunch the numbers and I</p>
<p>do like a real good evaluation sometimes</p>
<p>when you do muscle testing you get mixed</p>
<p>readings because the you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little subjective it&rsquo;s not a subjective</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just my point</p>
<p>yes fever and yeah there my friend had a</p>
<p>baby this is a long time ago that my</p>
<p>friend had a baby and her father didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe in doctors and she had fun and</p>
<p>because of them and they put the baby in</p>
<p>a hot bath and it died and I&rsquo;ve heard of</p>
<p>presidents and people in hot as favor</p>
<p>and some people that&rsquo;s crazy you know</p>
<p>your sediment off but I was just</p>
<p>wondering if you&rsquo;re gonna come cure</p>
<p>naturally things how can you make down</p>
<p>you know not 9 good question so Burke</p>
<p>asked a question about putting a baby in</p>
<p>the fever I started putting a baby in</p>
<p>hot water in the bath when fever yeah</p>
<p>that would be a problem I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend it the thing is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dangerous you know so like having high</p>
<p>temperatures with infants and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna raise it more and I can see</p>
<p>in an adult taking a hot bath one of the</p>
<p>best things for kids that have fevers</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s all related is simple</p>
<p>simple simple calcium lactate in fact if</p>
<p>you have kids infants if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a child go to the toughest or get</p>
<p>calcium lactate it&rsquo;s a non dairy type of</p>
<p>calcium it works like magic for kids any</p>
<p>type of problem with kids</p>
<p>fevers viral infections you give the</p>
<p>child a little calcium lactate</p>
<p>BAM it just seems to put the virus back</p>
<p>on mission pretty fast it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing I use kind of the secret remedy</p>
<p>for like 80% of problems and you kids</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cheap its quick and get rid of</p>
<p>fevers so check that out hey let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Karen for do you care do you have any</p>
<p>questions if you find any questions on</p>
<p>any of your laptop devices here I have a</p>
<p>lot of questions I also first want to</p>
<p>address the sound issue where we realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sound issue I really</p>
<p>appreciate you guys saying that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been an issue we&rsquo;re working on it some</p>
<p>of you have no issue now so I&rsquo;m still a</p>
<p>slight echo but we get it we&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>on it and hopefully that remedies okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see so I had an interesting</p>
<p>question here I thought I would throw at</p>
<p>you asking does walk in while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating change fat-burning or help in</p>
<p>keto diet oh that was interesting okay</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a valid question</p>
<p>you can probably kill two birds with one</p>
<p>stone I like to eat while I&rsquo;m driving</p>
<p>but the point is that I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things that are really really important</p>
<p>and things that are not significant</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of trivial as far as making</p>
<p>a difference you know people let me give</p>
<p>you an example of one that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trivial that&rsquo;s kind of a big deal</p>
<p>where Oh</p>
<p>recent study found that if you digit</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re watching TV you&rsquo;ll burn an</p>
<p>extra one or two calories per hour</p>
<p>first of all that&rsquo;s so insignificant so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to actually lose weight</p>
<p>by visiting lying or watching TV eating</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re walking I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>would influence things good or bad I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to create a huge</p>
<p>change I don&rsquo;t it I think you can try I</p>
<p>think it might if you specially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re doing any type of</p>
<p>exercise and you&rsquo;re eating you have to</p>
<p>realize when you exercise all the</p>
<p>digestive enzymes in the nervous system</p>
<p>that connects to the digestive system</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work as well when you&rsquo;re resting</p>
<p>and sitting there eating so I think for</p>
<p>that reason I would just you know eat at</p>
<p>the table and that wok while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating it&rsquo;s probably not gonna help you</p>
<p>any more powers okay all right so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to the next question we have another</p>
<p>question from Oklahoma on think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called uh Anastasia you had a question</p>
<p>about you know is it good for high</p>
<p>cholesterol high and these numbers are</p>
<p>really really high and then I need to</p>
<p>you know watch what I&rsquo;m eating meat</p>
<p>mostly vegetables before yeah but you</p>
<p>know I really good question I mean here</p>
<p>you are doing this great thing you lose</p>
<p>weight else in the cluster goes on the</p>
<p>doctor says you gotta stop eating all</p>
<p>these fats well not only can you tell me</p>
<p>with your class professor you happen to</p>
<p>have those numbers available like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your total cholesterol okay 48 degree my</p>
<p>one little side point that I want to</p>
<p>mention everyone watching I have a lot</p>
<p>of information on fasting health you</p>
<p>to the channel you&rsquo;re trying to find</p>
<p>something and Here I am talking about</p>
<p>something late in the chain of events</p>
<p>you might not get the whole thing so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing if you&rsquo;re watching on</p>
<p>Facebook what I did is I created a</p>
<p>really simple quite a mini course it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really course anyone could eat it of</p>
<p>course and what I want you to do is this</p>
<p>down below and that&rsquo;s key to the course</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll send you the course you just do</p>
<p>the basic four videos and then learn the</p>
<p>basics from A to Z</p>
<p>how do you know because you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to be catching a video that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the basic YouTube on the course so</p>
<p>you can clip that and then at least give</p>
<p>you the basics this is really good for</p>
<p>you click the link above the course</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the deal you&rsquo;re gonna lose fat</p>
<p>but the fat cells composed by the way of</p>
<p>fat in the combination of cholesterol</p>
<p>and this right that&rsquo;s what least from</p>
<p>your body from your fat cells it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>have to be mobilized and gotten rid of</p>
<p>to through the liver into the</p>
<p>gallbladder to the intestines so your</p>
<p>cholesterol will go up your</p>
<p>triglycerides will go up temporarily and</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll come down because that has</p>
<p>to come out this is why I always</p>
<p>recommend keep your vegetables high when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it so you can flush and</p>
<p>counter all the cholesterol stuff coming</p>
<p>out it&rsquo;s not an unhealthy situation it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not gonna clog up the arteries because</p>
<p>the whole thing that you should probably</p>
<p>watch the video I have on YouTube</p>
<p>related to LDL</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a pathogenic thing it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>dangerous thing at all it&rsquo;s just coming</p>
<p>out of your body</p>
<p>the dangerous thing is when you do</p>
<p>carbohydrates and refined sugars that</p>
<p>end up creating inflammation in the</p>
<p>arteries and the cholesterol comes in</p>
<p>and tries to heal it that way as a</p>
<p>and you it was a problem but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing keto and you&rsquo;re cutting out the</p>
<p>carbs we have to get that fat out of</p>
<p>there let&rsquo;s just take another point</p>
<p>about I don&rsquo;t know about 30 years ago</p>
<p>the normal cholesterol was 225 that was</p>
<p>normal cholesterol the arbitrarily load</p>
<p>it lowered it to 200 so the fact that</p>
<p>your cholesterol total cholesterol to 27</p>
<p>is basically normal triglycerides are</p>
<p>high you&rsquo;re gonna find the longer you do</p>
<p>this the triglycerides are going to come</p>
<p>down I think one of the best factors to</p>
<p>focus on overtime is triglycerides</p>
<p>because that if you could have the</p>
<p>sugars that&rsquo;s gonna come down if you</p>
<p>increase the sugars it&rsquo;s gonna go up but</p>
<p>the fact that you just started keto you</p>
<p>have nothing to worry about okay so but</p>
<p>just study study some of my videos on</p>
<p>LDL and I think you&rsquo;ll get the whole</p>
<p>picture but I know it&rsquo;s kind of scary</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna answer one more question</p>
<p>Arleen your the question from Delaware I</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m trying to represent the people</p>
<p>on YouTube and Facebook here so those of</p>
<p>you on Facebook just hold on we&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>to you and I gotta take hey Arlene you</p>
<p>had a question you&rsquo;re from Delaware your</p>
<p>question about prescriptions versus</p>
<p>digestif I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead yes good how</p>
<p>are you I&rsquo;m good I&rsquo;m good I have a</p>
<p>question you told me what to do oregano</p>
<p>oil but he&rsquo;s still coughing a lot so I</p>
<p>was wondering if he&rsquo;s dealing with a</p>
<p>digestive problem should he start taking</p>
<p>this medicine because he takes next year</p>
<p>and I heard a lot of bad things about</p>
<p>next year so I was wondering if your</p>
<p>digester so we&rsquo;ll replace that to see if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s little coughing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and also uh and also</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking their gold about a full</p>
<p>minute sometimes I get indigestion -</p>
<p>should I take that and also you sold me</p>
<p>about Candida and I was wondering it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the symptoms of Candida fever and</p>
<p>can you test this and I&rsquo;m taking the</p>
<p>grapefruit oil how do I know the candy</p>
<p>here is gone and is there any test that</p>
<p>I can take to you know find out if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still there</p>
<p>I still got some of the white tongue</p>
<p>okay okay so you have a lot of good</p>
<p>questions so that&rsquo;s about a it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be about a 3-hour answer so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to stand longer to answer although</p>
<p>just kidding</p>
<p>as far as take coming up next with that</p>
<p>but and it probably will take a lot of</p>
<p>stress off the ball as far as this is</p>
<p>always missing because you as you age</p>
<p>every decade you tend to lose stomach</p>
<p>acids I mean if you just did one thing</p>
<p>for everyone over the age of 50 you can</p>
<p>see protein better genetic as far as</p>
<p>getting rid of candy and make sure that</p>
<p>you cut this sugar out that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>biggest thing and probably milk as well</p>
<p>and I have a video so that&rsquo;s my answer</p>
<p>with that</p>
<p>and now let&rsquo;s face book you need a</p>
<p>question Karen yes facebooking YouTube</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna say some people are fine</p>
<p>with your audio now some people are</p>
<p>still hearing an echo and it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>work on the phone sound is not on I</p>
<p>appreciate your advice and we have some</p>
<p>great great production team here</p>
<p>so sorry I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s irritating but</p>
<p>we are working on it anyway I wanted to</p>
<p>represent Facebook in YouTube because</p>
<p>there are so many questions</p>
<p>interestingly dr. Berg there are a lot</p>
<p>of questions this morning on sex sex you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>it is a very important subject so there</p>
<p>some questions across the board here but</p>
<p>one has to do several times this kind of</p>
<p>with regard to the potency of sperm or</p>
<p>fertility and can the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>assist in fertility either for a man or</p>
<p>women can you well first of all what</p>
<p>really will kill the sperm is high</p>
<p>levels of insulin so and low levels of</p>
<p>testosterone so what happens typically</p>
<p>with testosterone in men is you get the</p>
<p>situation where you have high levels of</p>
<p>estrogen or insulin or cortisol those</p>
<p>are the three hormones that will shut</p>
<p>down libido potency sperm count</p>
<p>fertility is let me cover them estrogen</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s the female hormone but a</p>
<p>lot of men are getting it because the</p>
<p>food supply you&rsquo;re doing the the eating</p>
<p>of animal products with the sword that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why you organics whatever so we have</p>
<p>estrogen particularly of course that is</p>
<p>asleep you lower stress over long walk</p>
<p>sleep also depletes your autumn of that</p>
<p>in a couple formulas he support which I</p>
<p>use</p>
<p>I mean this is a big topic frequent you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find your fertility will</p>
<p>improve so those are the three that</p>
<p>would give you Karen oh you call that</p>
<p>Facebook we&rsquo;re gonna use that Facebook</p>
<p>so I I&rsquo;m gonna get this is I&rsquo;m gonna get</p>
<p>attention to my production crew and just</p>
<p>track one more thing try one more thing</p>
<p>and see if my mic volume is too loud</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s still some I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really irritating for you guys we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually gonna tunnel right now okay so</p>
<p>I know there are so many callers you</p>
<p>guys are calling in and you&rsquo;re waiting</p>
<p>patiently but we can&rsquo;t neglect these</p>
<p>these YouTube and Facebook guys there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many great questions and I had one</p>
<p>and there was a little distracted hold</p>
<p>on because these guys are awesome here</p>
<p>oh we had some questions about</p>
<p>ingredients I&rsquo;m gonna throw some of</p>
<p>these hats so several people get get</p>
<p>attention one is about milk thistle</p>
<p>mm-hmm one is about chia yeah and the</p>
<p>keto diet and um Wow another about chia</p>
<p>okay the other one with all with all the</p>
<p>sound a little milk thistle isn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>amazing herb for liver</p>
<p>support and rejuvenation there&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>little cells in the liver called the</p>
<p>podocytes</p>
<p>and milk thistle basically repairs the</p>
<p>liver so if you have a cirrhosis of the</p>
<p>liver or a fatty liver or liver damage</p>
<p>milk thistle is what I would be taking</p>
<p>if I were you and you can get it in a</p>
<p>tea or a supplement chia seed is very</p>
<p>good for increasing essential fatty</p>
<p>acids which help dry skin hormonal</p>
<p>health youthfulness anti-aging they have</p>
<p>a lot of other properties like</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory but she is a really</p>
<p>good omega-3 fatty acid and you can even</p>
<p>sprout the seeds as well here&rsquo;s one more</p>
<p>ingredient real fast real fast combo the</p>
<p>last two questions does soy milk affect</p>
<p>my sex drive yeah yeah the answer is yes</p>
<p>it does so you want to avoid soy because</p>
<p>soy increases estrogen estrogen</p>
<p>decreases testosterone and the other</p>
<p>point is that a lot of soya is GMO which</p>
<p>you do not want to consume because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>loaded with glyphosate which is the</p>
<p>herbicide so even if it&rsquo;s organic the</p>
<p>only time I&rsquo;d recommend doing organic</p>
<p>soy is if you do it sparingly and if you</p>
<p>want increase your estrogen let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you have a hot flash all right good so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to move right along to</p>
<p>Christopher here from San Antonio you</p>
<p>depression about a kilo diet and weight</p>
<p>gain I work a quick dessert which is</p>
<p>pretty much your cake with chocolate</p>
<p>kale powder and some of the</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s calling kale kale mix and all that</p>
<p>up and that&rsquo;s my heel oh so I can say</p>
<p>that when we&rsquo;re looking pretty much I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just having trouble gaining weight and I</p>
<p>do hit kitchen</p>
<p>first of all San Antonio I was there in</p>
<p>1980 or over yeah</p>
<p>forts Fort Sam it&rsquo;s a country club in</p>
<p>the army I was there being trained as a</p>
<p>medic in the Army Reserve so I had great</p>
<p>great memories of Fort Sam Houston but</p>
<p>the point is that you want to you want</p>
<p>to gain weight and you want to do a</p>
<p>fasting one meal a day it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>of a situation because typically going</p>
<p>to lose weight you&rsquo;re gonna have to go</p>
<p>up on everything like a little bit more</p>
<p>fat of course the data might knock you</p>
<p>out of that I mean it&rsquo;s probably good</p>
<p>for weight gain but it&rsquo;ll knock you out</p>
<p>ketosis but for you you might be okay</p>
<p>with it but I would probably go with the</p>
<p>green bananas because it&rsquo;s high in</p>
<p>resisting starch which basically even</p>
<p>though the carbohydrates are high it</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t increase your blood glucose level</p>
<p>very much so it will counter things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s resistance starch so green</p>
<p>bananas but I would do didn&rsquo;t sound like</p>
<p>you did enough protein add a little bit</p>
<p>more protein a little more fat spread it</p>
<p>up within four hours and then as far as</p>
<p>your workouts go you want to gain weight</p>
<p>you want to do higher weights low reps</p>
<p>but of course you have to work up to</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to hurt yourself so</p>
<p>slowly do with all your body weights</p>
<p>pull resistant type workouts and then</p>
<p>gradually go into heavier weights</p>
<p>low reps okay and that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>to do if you wanted to gain weight</p>
<p>good I&rsquo;m jumping in here sorry I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>jumping in here because there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>things one I want to say the cabbies</p>
<p>frozen dessert is available on dr.</p>
<p>Berger comm just go to the shop a lot of</p>
<p>people asking how to get that it is</p>
<p>available already so there you go the</p>
<p>other thing a lot of people asking this</p>
<p>is a common question what happens if I</p>
<p>into two different body types or what</p>
<p>you alright so good questions good now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a caller from well first of</p>
<p>all want to talk about the first of all</p>
<p>one ingredient cuz there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>question people have it&rsquo;s like they</p>
<p>wonder why I have tapioca isomalt</p>
<p>illegal sack right so I carry a little</p>
<p>illegal right</p>
<p>I so both illegal so this is this is</p>
<p>kind of a supreme erotic fiber which</p>
<p>basically means it&rsquo;s used as a sweetener</p>
<p>in the fibre bacteria can ferment it</p>
<p>break it down they can actually eat it</p>
<p>and help help you it does have you know</p>
<p>if I seem to Connexus about thirty three</p>
<p>point six six which means it&rsquo;s not very</p>
<p>high not zero like retort all that when</p>
<p>we experimented with ice cream and took</p>
<p>that out it destroyed the whole texture</p>
<p>and the taste so and the other thing is</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s certain bars that use</p>
<p>isomalt oligosaccharides by the way i</p>
<p>make amazing maple syrup with like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>also you can&rsquo;t even pronounce it canyon</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ice so volatile illegal soccer</p>
<p>right but anyway here&rsquo;s the thing when</p>
<p>you actually use that it&rsquo;s not zero but</p>
<p>you users all knows it&rsquo;s gonna be okay</p>
<p>for example you see some of these bars</p>
<p>out there they&rsquo;re using like 40 grams of</p>
<p>this erotic we use like so right now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in the middle of testing ice cream on</p>
<p>medications and so far so good it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>raising so anyway it has a sugar content</p>
<p>and then if you&rsquo;re a mix body type and I</p>
<p>just want to cover this because this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t in the book this is a we did the</p>
<p>first version now we do the second</p>
<p>version which is going to make this look</p>
<p>right here</p>
<p>many people are Missoni type there is no</p>
<p>way you&rsquo;re gonna have a really damaged</p>
<p>weak adrenal and then happy thyroid</p>
<p>gland</p>
<p>behold a chain and it&rsquo;s all connected</p>
<p>but the point is where do you start to</p>
<p>bring everything up well everyone in</p>
<p>this book is gonna start with a basic</p>
<p>plan it&rsquo;s the same thing for one or two</p>
<p>weeks and then what you&rsquo;ll do is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna branch out into the other work so</p>
<p>you can actually try and see if it works</p>
<p>to determine what your real words if you</p>
<p>support the far right hi it&rsquo;s Warren</p>
<p>fondling hi I have a really bad sweet</p>
<p>tooth and I was reading the book and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like pancakes and brownies and</p>
<p>like that he might have that or didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to wait okay good okay started this</p>
<p>is the perfect reason why I put all the</p>
<p>recipes for pancakes and the treats and</p>
<p>someone like you that you starting out</p>
<p>you have sweet tooth you need an</p>
<p>alternative he said it&rsquo;s like no sugar</p>
<p>in these recipes so make them keep it in</p>
<p>the fridge rater and put them into your</p>
<p>diet at in meal as a treat and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>feel very satisfied but what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen over the next two weeks your</p>
<p>cravings are gonna go down your hunger</p>
<p>is gonna go down the need for those will</p>
<p>down to the point where you don&rsquo;t often</p>
<p>but yeah these recipes want you to think</p>
<p>of long-term solutions ago I ate one C</p>
<p>under 7.0 trust early sometimes but my</p>
<p>question is because they&rsquo;re so hard for</p>
<p>me to lose weight my highest weight was</p>
<p>248 which was a couple months ago I put</p>
<p>it down there well yes I got on the</p>
<p>scale I was 239 and this just started</p>
<p>since I stopped eating meat I stopped</p>
<p>eating meat two weeks ago okay I just</p>
<p>wanted to see what my body would do so</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m interested but I don&rsquo;t know if I</p>
<p>need me to do keto got it or can a</p>
<p>vegetarian okay good yeah every morning</p>
<p>but I ain&rsquo;t one started doing it before</p>
<p>every meal that I listen to you the</p>
<p>other days it takes um before each meal</p>
<p>yeah let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s cover these real</p>
<p>quickly first of all this the fact you</p>
<p>have a gallbladder out tells me probably</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some digestive weaknesses and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably why you have a hard time</p>
<p>digesting meat because the stomach</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the pH and so you probably</p>
<p>want to continue doing the opposite of</p>
<p>vinegar he</p>
<p>maybe the tablet form over a period of</p>
<p>time so you can acidify your stomach so</p>
<p>you can start pulling a more protein</p>
<p>yeah so if you don&rsquo;t do well the meat</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t dump to me some alternative</p>
<p>things I have a video on how to do keto</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re vegan I&rsquo;m gonna have you click</p>
<p>search set out and find it it&rsquo;s a common</p>
<p>question I&rsquo;m gonna have to do more</p>
<p>videos on that there are other</p>
<p>alternative sources of protein if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>vegan spirulina blue-green algae there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a whole bunch of them you can do some</p>
<p>nuts and peanut butter and some people</p>
<p>do fine</p>
<p>so I think with you your challenge is</p>
<p>probably weakness within the stomach</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not able to digest it so you</p>
<p>remove that often you feel better the</p>
<p>fact that you&rsquo;re doing this is great</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll actually bring a1c below</p>
<p>7.0 pretty A to B if you continue this I</p>
<p>want you to really work on intermittent</p>
<p>fasting like start to do the intimate</p>
<p>fasting portion of this which is just</p>
<p>the frequency of eating and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>see huge changes now you had a question</p>
<p>about Irish Irish moss that is really</p>
<p>good to fortify your blood if you take</p>
<p>it as a supplement you can also put in a</p>
<p>tea and it will it&rsquo;s a blood fortifier</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s high in certain nutrients that</p>
<p>actually build up blood and you have</p>
<p>more energy from it okay good care any</p>
<p>questions over there any questions at</p>
<p>all yes I&rsquo;m trying to combine some</p>
<p>things together because there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>questions between Facebook and YouTube</p>
<p>but first I want to take up this</p>
<p>conversation that&rsquo;s going on I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on YouTube about the sore throat I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s Jamal dr. Berg has a video go</p>
<p>to his video blog and what is it a sore</p>
<p>throat or singing I think I actually do</p>
<p>it on you but it&rsquo;s singers hoarseness</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s about versus singers just type</p>
<p>in singers hoarseness dr. Berg and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find the one on this that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the videos right so there you go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the sore throat kind of be able</p>
<p>to start singing to if you do that will</p>
<p>immediately become a singer it&rsquo;s double</p>
<p>whammy okay the other the other</p>
<p>questions that are</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to throw it you here have</p>
<p>to do with fruit one is bananas there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a conversation going on about bananas</p>
<p>being a great source of or a source of</p>
<p>potassium I want you to talk about that</p>
<p>because I know that that&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s their potassium solution</p>
<p>also questions about I have a smoothie</p>
<p>how much fruit can I use what kind of</p>
<p>fruit can I use what does that do to</p>
<p>Quito there you go</p>
<p>okay good and by the way I have a favor</p>
<p>to ask of all of you click the share</p>
<p>button on Facebook and also share on</p>
<p>YouTube because we want to get the word</p>
<p>out we want people to start using this</p>
<p>data and because of you you helped</p>
<p>helped us get the word out and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people getting great</p>
<p>results so definitely share this</p>
<p>information I really appreciate it</p>
<p>sore throats go to the video okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>simple it&rsquo;s a no-brainer it can really</p>
<p>help you the technique I mean its</p>
<p>borders on magic just try it don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>believe me just do it as far as bananas</p>
<p>go it&rsquo;s real simple it&rsquo;s like what is</p>
<p>the amount of potassium in event of an</p>
<p>entire pan medium sized it&rsquo;s 300</p>
<p>milligrams but your requirement is 40 so</p>
<p>how many times Karen it&rsquo;s 300 go into</p>
<p>4700 but the point is that those beet</p>
<p>leaves general vegetables are way higher</p>
<p>the problem with Anna is the sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna bump you want to keep this</p>
<p>in well it&rsquo;s worse than the banana is an</p>
<p>apple this I know actually 19 grams</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna totally can&rsquo;t do the green</p>
<p>banana okay</p>
<p>I recently</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>like it even tastes like banana but if</p>
<p>you take a plantain we&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>cooking you okay now we don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>fruit it&rsquo;s the only food you can have</p>
<p>which is berries hey Gloria I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>Gloria I apologize but I have to say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like nine billion people on</p>
<p>Facebook typing nothing but keto course</p>
<p>keto course please you have to address</p>
<p>that yeah yeah how does nine billion</p>
<p>yeah what you wanted to you want to type</p>
<p>Aquila course underneath on messenger</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna send you the course yeah</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re on Facebook type quito</p>
<p>poorest and you will automatically get</p>
<p>the kid of course if you&rsquo;re on youtube</p>
<p>you click the link below and yeah that</p>
<p>was my question and I&rsquo;m 63 years old and</p>
<p>on the adrenal thyroid type I&rsquo;m on an 18</p>
<p>hour fast six hour eating window so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating basically one meal and one snack</p>
<p>a day and I&rsquo;m at like 1,300 calories is</p>
<p>that enough calories because I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>losing weight I lost 15 pounds in the</p>
<p>first month and it&rsquo;s been seven months</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t lost an ounce but drop two</p>
<p>dress sizes</p>
<p>okay all right here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>question you 62 do you have other body</p>
<p>issues do you have loose skin do you</p>
<p>have any issue with</p>
<p>did you have like any type of sagging</p>
<p>skin in your body usually actually no I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m in pretty good shape I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>surprised that I have such a good</p>
<p>elasticity for having shrunk good so</p>
<p>much I&rsquo;ve always exercised my whole life</p>
<p>in a twill immune immune deficiency</p>
<p>problems and I got very sick and my</p>
<p>tongue was just like a white coat but on</p>
<p>the Keeler now my tongue is pink and</p>
<p>clean so I have benefited in so many</p>
<p>ways so I do take 75 milligrams of</p>
<p>centroid you the electrolyte powder</p>
<p>every day we crash use powder every day</p>
<p>advanced adrenal the gall bladder and</p>
<p>the sleep aid okay 63 not the macro</p>
<p>calories the nutrients nutrients in</p>
<p>those calories I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I would change too many things</p>
<p>other than just make sure the nutrient</p>
<p>dense how do you have nutritional</p>
<p>deficiencies like are you having any</p>
<p>issues with your energy are you feeling</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re losing hair is that you know</p>
<p>are you having any other symptoms that</p>
<p>are worse since you&rsquo;ve recently been on</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t sound like it you have all</p>
<p>these other benefits so in that case you</p>
<p>are getting all your nutrients so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it so you bet you</p>
<p>plateaued and probably what happened is</p>
<p>you improved your muscle density and</p>
<p>that and it&rsquo;s a little heavier than fat</p>
<p>so you lost two sizes which is in</p>
<p>credible and that&rsquo;s really a bet the</p>
<p>best indicators are your close fitting</p>
<p>loser are you shrinking are you getting</p>
<p>smaller and and if you&rsquo;re down to one</p>
<p>and a half miles a day and things are</p>
<p>improving and you start to keep</p>
<p>shrinking that&rsquo;s right if you plateau</p>
<p>with you&rsquo;re shrinking in size forget</p>
<p>about the weight then I would look at</p>
<p>other issues and that&rsquo;s what this book</p>
<p>covers all the other you probably</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t already but all the other body</p>
<p>issues like you said your thyroid issues</p>
<p>you know why do you have to take you</p>
<p>know you take it one step further add</p>
<p>more exercise try to get more sleep I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think the problem is not enough</p>
<p>calories I think you&rsquo;re doing great I</p>
<p>think I would ride the wave and tweak</p>
<p>your tweak your weakest link which is</p>
<p>your thyroid all right</p>
<p>good question okay so Karen you have any</p>
<p>questions for me I do I&rsquo;m gonna let you</p>
<p>guys know this sound some people are</p>
<p>fine with the sound we&rsquo;d have to kill</p>
<p>the show to debug it so we&rsquo;re writing it</p>
<p>out and I&rsquo;m sorry about that but what</p>
<p>was my question now okay oh no no no no</p>
<p>no several questions are on loose skin</p>
<p>you keep talking to the callers about if</p>
<p>someone has loose skin this and that but</p>
<p>can you specifically address will keto</p>
<p>the improved loose skin okay</p>
<p>so loose skin is a loss of collagen when</p>
<p>you have loss of college and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>protein and people think that you know</p>
<p>when you lose weight healthily the skin</p>
<p>should come back slowly but you might</p>
<p>still end up with a bit of loose muscle</p>
<p>tissue in the skin it&rsquo;s called atrophy</p>
<p>and that takes a while to heal it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a little thing it&rsquo;s a pretty big thing</p>
<p>and it could be purchased in activity</p>
<p>for years and years and years so what</p>
<p>you need to do is include not just a</p>
<p>keto but more</p>
<p>intermittent fasting if you can work to</p>
<p>two meals a day and even one meal a day</p>
<p>without snacking addition to that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find that you&rsquo;re going to go into</p>
<p>a condition called a top of G what does</p>
<p>that mean top of G is the state where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re cleaning up all the old damaged</p>
<p>cellular parts and protein and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>replacing with you know it&rsquo;s cleaning up</p>
<p>all the old bacteria fungus viruses</p>
<p>cleaning it up you&rsquo;re going to notice</p>
<p>your skin tighter and tighter and</p>
<p>tighter growth</p>
<p>well what kills that is the frequent</p>
<p>eating and the snacks in between so stay</p>
<p>really consistent with your one two</p>
<p>meals even one meal a day which hope I</p>
<p>mean every single Skype that I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>so far in it and I quite a few urban is</p>
<p>doing one the other day and you got to</p>
<p>work up to that but they don&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>adding a little more little food here</p>
<p>and there do the one or two meals and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cheat okay and you&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>your skin tighten up better than</p>
<p>anything else</p>
<p>all right hey Cindy you&rsquo;re from Idaho</p>
<p>and you had a question</p>
<p>Oh your son&rsquo;s arrested I want to hear</p>
<p>about this yes okay yes okay so my son</p>
<p>is a high school wrestler very</p>
<p>competitive very athletic weight or</p>
<p>cutting or extreme calories and</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve been talking to him</p>
<p>instead of that doing keto and I was</p>
<p>wondering how healthy is it for a</p>
<p>fifteen-year-old very athletic very</p>
<p>little body fat boy - no question I was</p>
<p>wrestler I did it all wrong my body</p>
<p>weight for years that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s ended</p>
<p>my growth fixed you brother six seven</p>
<p>eight five my mom but the point is that</p>
<p>you can really mess you up if you try to</p>
<p>cut weight unhealthily and the wrestlers</p>
<p>are notorious for this they do all sorts</p>
<p>of things</p>
<p>just basically they&rsquo;re not looking at</p>
<p>the quality food you know I did a video</p>
<p>on how for wrestlers how to cut weight</p>
<p>the healthy way you know is super</p>
<p>healthy so what you need to do is apply</p>
<p>a combination of Kido and when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to cut weight because that way</p>
<p>you nutrition and you won&rsquo;t drop energy</p>
<p>I was barely a week starving a nutrition</p>
<p>of course I was eating the breads in the</p>
<p>positive sugar so the big huge and then</p>
<p>a moderate amount of protein and then go</p>
<p>up with the fat you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>really lean and you can lose weight</p>
<p>healthy on that and if you need to</p>
<p>really do the cutting you start putting</p>
<p>on the mat you&rsquo;ll use seriously</p>
<p>hopefully highly recommended it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to make you tired is all the sugar in</p>
<p>the diet in the carbs right watch that</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t you care you have a question I</p>
<p>have questions I have another questions</p>
<p>first there&rsquo;s another clarification on</p>
<p>yeah I think although it&rsquo;s not being</p>
<p>said there&rsquo;s question on eating</p>
<p>during the fasting I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a spoonful of rice yeah it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>chia pudding or something like that so</p>
<p>address that and also know that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be doing some recipes in the fall</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve been in a slacker in the</p>
<p>math department and we definitely are</p>
<p>lining up some similar recipes and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had a bunch of surveys and we heard you</p>
<p>and Luke the single guy who detest</p>
<p>cooking we&rsquo;re gonna handle it okay now</p>
<p>so please answer the question on Shia</p>
<p>good another one all right so then we</p>
<p>can definitely start next week I knew</p>
<p>that recipe right okay good you heard it</p>
<p>okay she&rsquo;s he</p>
<p>during the passing you know it really</p>
<p>depends i would not suspect that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to increase your insulin very much</p>
<p>especially give you a little bit but a</p>
<p>little bit of a snack if you do it as a</p>
<p>transition step go for out of all the</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s probably a release problem</p>
<p>but the point is that during the fasting</p>
<p>period what you want to do instead is at</p>
<p>that meal before it&rsquo;s add more fat you</p>
<p>know longer and longer that&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>goal so you have nothing between the</p>
<p>mail at all now you can do your one cup</p>
<p>of coffee in the morning one or if you</p>
<p>duty on TV or you do a little bit more</p>
<p>off that&rsquo;s fine we do wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder with water</p>
<p>on occasion I do shake too much but you</p>
<p>can use up one tea to drink it really</p>
<p>help you is gymnema tea that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good one between the meals and if you</p>
<p>drink that and try to eat anything sweet</p>
<p>you will not be able to taste sweet</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll destroy</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>and the book yeah cream of tarter is not</p>
<p>the best source of potassium you want to</p>
<p>get it from raw vegetables as far as an</p>
<p>infant taking cod liver oil kind of oil</p>
<p>is a pretty concentrated thing if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do cod liver oil just do very very</p>
<p>small amounts for the ideal C is to give</p>
<p>the infant&rsquo;s the breast milk and then</p>
<p>feed the cod liver oil to your wife that</p>
<p>would be the ideal scene but as the</p>
<p>infant becomes older into the toddler</p>
<p>cod liver oil is awesome awesome</p>
<p>providing an A and vitamin d3 I mean</p>
<p>your grandmother probably gave you cod</p>
<p>liver oil it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s such a great remedy</p>
<p>I would blue with a high-quality one</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one that I like it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>virgin olive oil you&rsquo;ve got an Amazon</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only like two companies that</p>
<p>sell it but it&rsquo;s really high quality</p>
<p>olive oil is awesome okay yes yes let me</p>
<p>find one you find me and I&rsquo;m gonna go to</p>
<p>salon from Michigan you had a question</p>
<p>about keto and trying to conceive yes</p>
<p>Alan how you doing afterwards I just I</p>
<p>just wanted to act</p>
<p>is it safe to do the Kyodai and is it</p>
<p>especially is it safe to do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting when trying to conceive and also</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re pregnant okay good so this</p>
<p>is a good question because I just did a</p>
<p>video on this so when you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>become more fertile and conceive think</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re doing with the keto</p>
<p>and people think it&rsquo;s dangerous simply</p>
<p>because there was a study out on mice</p>
<p>okay now humans that said that you can</p>
<p>now have no information of the organs if</p>
<p>you do a ketogenic diet right which is</p>
<p>so funny because if you look at what</p>
<p>these mice ate it&rsquo;s nothing that you</p>
<p>would ever eat it has to do with KC milk</p>
<p>protein crystal oil that&rsquo;s the fat</p>
<p>crystal that&rsquo;s trans fats</p>
<p>soy corn</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the Feeny that&rsquo;s their</p>
<p>ketogenic diet you guarantee if you</p>
<p>consume that your organs would be a</p>
<p>problem but the point is that no it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>healthy thing keto is just about getting</p>
<p>rid of the sugar and supplying healthy</p>
<p>fats and moderate protein a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables the type of keto that I</p>
<p>recommend is very very very healthy as</p>
<p>seen in all the reviews and videos that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing online but yeah because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re reducing insulin</p>
<p>resistance that&rsquo;s going to automatically</p>
<p>cause you to increase the nutrients in</p>
<p>the cell because in protein when you</p>
<p>have been some resistance that cell</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t pull in all the potassium and the</p>
<p>minerals and the vitamins and protein so</p>
<p>right there you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>nutritionally deficient guess what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen to the you know your</p>
<p>fertility it&rsquo;s gonna go down so this is</p>
<p>really good as a therapeutic thing to</p>
<p>improve your fertility and health the</p>
<p>health of your future baby I would</p>
<p>highly recommend and will also help you</p>
<p>once you actually become pregnant what I</p>
<p>probably do is I probably just do three</p>
<p>little snacking but when you do one the</p>
<p>other day I mean just to make sure but</p>
<p>you have to realize that when you become</p>
<p>pregnant your body will adapt and start</p>
<p>extracting as many nutrients as you can</p>
<p>but the goal is to consume the required</p>
<p>nutrients to make sure you&rsquo;re healthy in</p>
<p>fact the definition of food is comes</p>
<p>from so you can read this book and this</p>
<p>one as well it&rsquo;s all about just eating</p>
<p>healthy to lose weight now it was the</p>
<p>way to get healthy and keto is just one</p>
<p>way to do it because it drops this one</p>
<p>in a minute fasting is another way to do</p>
<p>it because you can have insulin so and</p>
<p>then when you&rsquo;re breastfeeding this new</p>
<p>community today no snacking and</p>
<p>recommending and you are going to baby</p>
<p>one point about you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>conceive the two main vitamins vitamin</p>
<p>categories that are usually always</p>
<p>deficient in minerals so in the</p>
<p>supplement is one that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>and the other one is the fats vitamins</p>
<p>consume you the convoy or healthy grass</p>
<p>and butter to get the nutrition for the</p>
<p>vitamins which is the other thing that</p>
<p>always is important to consume you know</p>
<p>your story about money too reminded me</p>
<p>of the time that you were you had three</p>
<p>crates of mice in the basement and you</p>
<p>were feeding them all different things</p>
<p>like when you were feeding not seven</p>
<p>another you were feeding wheat bread and</p>
<p>in another cage you were feeding them</p>
<p>just puff cereal you remember that yeah</p>
<p>and right after you started the whole</p>
<p>experiment you left town oh right I had</p>
<p>to feed the mice and and and the past</p>
<p>serial mice actually ate each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heads mice it just came back in a you</p>
<p>know full-color and they didn&rsquo;t escape</p>
<p>well I find that when you you eat the</p>
<p>head off anything to escape its</p>
<p>decreases here&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m with mice</p>
<p>real quick I wanted to see what would</p>
<p>happen if you fed mice mice food whole</p>
<p>wheat bread Wonder Bread I didn&rsquo;t season</p>
<p>us well the nice food checkout take a</p>
<p>wild guess and I want you guys to type</p>
<p>in the comments right now sake well yes</p>
<p>tell me when they do that what food</p>
<p>created the most damage okay what</p>
<p>correct look what what a category of</p>
<p>food created in most destructive thing</p>
<p>in this what is it the my food was it</p>
<p>the wheat bread whole wheat bread was it</p>
<p>the white Wonder bread or was it the</p>
<p>organic go ahead and tell me when they</p>
<p>start to type yeah so type that in there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna answer the question after</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>after I talk to Howard I want them to</p>
<p>type it in there I want to see what they</p>
<p>think what food created the most</p>
<p>destruction of this place okay I&rsquo;ll come</p>
<p>back answer hey Howard you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Florida Keys your question about you hit</p>
<p>keto diet Plateau go ahead almost three</p>
<p>weeks I am showing you no power okay so</p>
<p>are you noticing your stomach is</p>
<p>shrinking at all yeah okay good here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening Howard you are burning</p>
<p>fat but it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re also gaining muscle</p>
<p>mass when you actually start doing keto</p>
<p>and fasting your muscles start to be</p>
<p>preserved like you start developing more</p>
<p>muscle as you lose fat and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have a net zero weight loss almost</p>
<p>everyone that&rsquo;s why the best indicator</p>
<p>is to measure your waist if the waist is</p>
<p>shrinking which it should be you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>closing looser then you are burning fat</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t ethos as it is working you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting energy you&rsquo;re slowing down</p>
<p>better that means it&rsquo;s working so I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re right on track and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I wanted to because I don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>to think you&rsquo;re going and stop because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working ride the wave and start to</p>
<p>actually add more than fascinating and I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re gonna notice the weight</p>
<p>loss will start kicking in once you</p>
<p>start preserving the muscles because a</p>
<p>lot of people have this exact same thing</p>
<p>thanks for your question okay</p>
<p>the answers okay and hello back to Wells</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>most people are saying red white or</p>
<p>wheat bread</p>
<p>a few people that were really paying</p>
<p>attention you know got the message on</p>
<p>the puffed wheat but do you remember</p>
<p>what happened to the guys they were</p>
<p>eating the week yeah</p>
<p>I was I know that wasn&rsquo;t it the first</p>
<p>group of mice that started basically the</p>
<p>pastoralism Paul stick called beating</p>
<p>the blue giants was released called</p>
<p>alloxan and we created damage so it was</p>
<p>fine one the second group had a problems</p>
<p>was the holy bread and that was because</p>
<p>of the amount of chemicals they use use</p>
<p>retardants for mold and fungus and</p>
<p>chemicals to start slow down the</p>
<p>microbial growth directly so Adderley is</p>
<p>chemical they had the chemicals in there</p>
<p>so that is the problem and then the</p>
<p>white bread and then I mean it was</p>
<p>incredibly bread and you think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a healthiest thing to do it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really not and of course sprout it if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not trying to lose weight you</p>
<p>know sprout about his best Ezekiel bread</p>
<p>is good but just make sure that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>organic and read the labels make sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these chemicals in there and</p>
<p>you remember though the bread guys got</p>
<p>really fat and really low they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>yeah yes so if you want a fat like your</p>
<p>mice he been bred for the seeds the</p>
<p>seeds and the nuts guys they had like</p>
<p>this sleek hair and they speedy and</p>
<p>running around you know I I had a really</p>
<p>good so what what is the absolute food</p>
<p>that everyone loves ice cream no if you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s nuts no right so now what is</p>
<p>the big problem</p>
<p>when people are eating that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>biggest problem is everybody&rsquo;s here</p>
<p>digestion bloating sort of because</p>
<p>terminated right because the enzyme</p>
<p>inhibitors are there and the phytic acid</p>
<p>which prevents the absorption of</p>
<p>nutrients right right so but what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem about germinating seeds nuts it</p>
<p>you have to do it overnight then you get</p>
<p>a drying out for 12 to 24 hours it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pain in the butt so and no one wants to</p>
<p>do that so I said you know I thought of</p>
<p>an idea yeah I just went to the company</p>
<p>where we do the dehydration of the the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice and they have a system</p>
<p>the only one in the world that can</p>
<p>actually dry things without heating</p>
<p>things like 160 degrees I&rsquo;m gonna ask</p>
<p>them I&rsquo;m gonna call them up and see if</p>
<p>they can dry you hydrate nuts it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit thicker but if they can do</p>
<p>that you imagine consuming dried nuts</p>
<p>that are low temperatures I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be incredible you guys know you</p>
<p>have now participated in my every</p>
<p>morning Karen I have an idea I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be revolutionary now in the circle</p>
<p>everybody you&rsquo;re in the circle this is</p>
<p>it just got this incredible seats and</p>
<p>nuts that are dry perfectly I mean oh my</p>
<p>gosh I&rsquo;m so crunchy I can&rsquo;t wait I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming this this doesn&rsquo;t mean like</p>
<p>rodeo or yeehaw it I think this is like</p>
<p>rabbit hey guys well thanks for your</p>
<p>wonderful calls I hope you had a couple</p>
<p>tips thank you Karen for answering these</p>
<p>questions yeah thanks for the YouTube</p>
