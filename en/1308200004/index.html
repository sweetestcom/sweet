    <p>Hello, dear listener. I&rsquo;m Megan, host of this series. And before we get into the show,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a minute to tell you about our sponsor, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual</p>
<p>Rights and Expression. We live in a moment when free speech, the bedrock of our democracy</p>
<p>and of all free societies, is often viewed as suspect, where many argue that the right</p>
<p>to free speech is too dangerous, and that even listening to ideological opponents is</p>
<p>morally wrong. Many people just don&rsquo;t see a problem with using the law, corporate power,</p>
<p>and even extraordinary social pressure to censor viewpoints they disagree with. But</p>
<p>many of us feel the costs of all this in our everyday lives. We feel it when we self-censor,</p>
<p>afraid to say what we really think, sometimes even in private conversations with friends</p>
<p>or loved ones. We feel it when we opt out of a growing number of public discussions,</p>
<p>afraid of the potential cost to our jobs and even our relationships. FIRE shares a mission</p>
<p>with this show, to remind us why a culture of free speech and open dialogue matters.</p>
<p>And regardless of how loud the calls for censorship are, FIRE&rsquo;s defense of that culture is unshakable</p>
<p>and invaluable. And if you want to remember why we choose freedom, even for people we</p>
<p>strenuously disagree with, you can learn more about FIRE&rsquo;s incredible work at thefire.org.</p>
<p>And now, on to the show.</p>
<p>This episode contains language that might not be suitable for children.</p>
<p>So, for someone who&rsquo;s never heard the term TERF, trans-exclusionary radical feminist,</p>
<p>what is a TERF? Where does that term come from and what does it describe?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;re getting quite how offensive a term it is to many people.</p>
<p>Journalist Helen Lewis, staff writer at The Atlantic and author of the book Difficult</p>
<p>Women, A History of Feminism in 11 Fights.</p>
<p>Think about it like the word queer, which some people are very happy to self-describe</p>
<p>as. And for other people, it&rsquo;s the term that, you know, someone with a skinhead shouted</p>
<p>at them before trying to beat them up outside a nightclub. And that&rsquo;s how a lot of women</p>
<p>feel about TERF. You know, some feel that they&rsquo;ve reclaimed it. Others feel this is</p>
<p>a word that they associate with people who want to slit their throat. So it&rsquo;s one that</p>
<p>I would handle with tongs, as it were.</p>
<p>It stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist, and it kind of doesn&rsquo;t mean any of those things</p>
<p>anymore. I&rsquo;m often called a TERF, even though I&rsquo;ve written in print that I think trans-women</p>
<p>are women. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, though. It just means this is a bad woman. You don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to know any more about her. I mean, TERF is basically witch.</p>
<p>I had been becoming increasingly concerned about the way in which women were being shut</p>
<p>down. Women who I felt had some very valid concerns. I was starting to see activists</p>
<p>behaving in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings. Like, what were they doing?</p>
<p>They were banging and kicking on windows. Very threatening. They were masked. I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>at an assault now on freedom of speech, freedom of thought, even freedom of association.</p>
<p>Fuck you! Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit! You look like you&rsquo;ve got your teeth knocked</p>
<p>out, you fucking fascist! Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares and you will die</p>
<p>alone! You will die alone and you will burn in hell!</p>
<p>Chapter 4. TERF Wars. Growing up, what did you understand feminism to be? Who were the</p>
<p>feminists that you looked up to and what did you see them fighting for?</p>
<p>I was very feminist in my late teens, early 20s. And I was reading books that even then</p>
<p>were a little outdated. People like Kate Millich, Germaine Greer, Simone de Beauvoir, obviously,</p>
<p>who was long dead by the time I came to her book. I would describe myself now and probably</p>
<p>then too as an idealist, definitely, but never really an ideologue. I was, and always</p>
<p>have been, passionately concerned about the plight of girls and women, not only in the</p>
<p>West but further afield. J.K. Rowling was born in 1965 and that means that she lives</p>
<p>her youth through a particularly vibrant time for the UK feminist movement. In 1971, the</p>
<p>first women&rsquo;s refuge opened in Britain, in Chiswick in West London. And that was the</p>
<p>first time that women who had been beaten up by their partners, you know, had somewhere</p>
<p>to go. They had somewhere to leave. You&rsquo;re saying there weren&rsquo;t places like that until</p>
<p>1971? Yeah, the first one was founded by a woman called Erin Pitsy. Very shortly after</p>
<p>we started, women began to come and talk about the fact they were battered at home by their</p>
<p>husbands and they seemed to be able to get no help from the social services, from the</p>
<p>police or from their solicitors. And her stories about that first refuge are heartbreaking.</p>
<p>You know, women walking in covered with bruises, covered in cigarette burns. Nobody seemed</p>
<p>to be doing anything constructive to help. They just seemed to be sending these women</p>
<p>back to the men who beat them and some back to be killed. In 1971, when Rowling would</p>
<p>have just been a young girl heading off to primary school, the world was seeing the development</p>
<p>of something that women in my generation grew up largely taking for granted. A place to</p>
<p>go when you&rsquo;ve been the victim of what we now call domestic violence.</p>
<p>He came home one day and he cut me right across the ear with a carving knife. I had to wait</p>
<p>until he collapsed and fell asleep, you know, before I could go to the hospital.</p>
<p>The things that people were going through in private behind closed doors during that</p>
<p>time are now quite horrifying to reflect on. He strangled me once and all I could remember</p>
<p>in the end was all this blood, thick, slimy blood, all coming out my mouth. I was on the</p>
<p>line between life and death. And it was part of a wider movement that decade</p>
<p>about the idea that you weren&rsquo;t just talking about what police used to euphemistically</p>
<p>called wife beating, which was usually done in response, you know, to nagging and was</p>
<p>therefore just a domestic. All of that language got swept away and people instead began to</p>
<p>talk about domestic violence and that the idea that this was a crime and that was something</p>
<p>that caused real harm and needed to be prosecuted.</p>
<p>The shelter not only gave women a safe refuge, but it also raised awareness of how often</p>
<p>these things were happening. And that paved the way for real changes in law enforcement</p>
<p>and social services. This is the founder of that first shelter, Erin Pitsy, speaking</p>
<p>in 2014. And the other problem also, unless she had</p>
<p>a family to go to who would protect her, there was no money because as soon as she tried</p>
<p>to go to get some kind of security money from social security, they&rsquo;d say to her, but your</p>
<p>husband in those days mostly, your husband wants you back. So therefore you&rsquo;re not entitled</p>
<p>to anything. Protecting women from both partner violence</p>
<p>and the poverty that could befall them if they tried to leave their husbands became</p>
<p>a primary focus of British feminism throughout Rowling&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>So that was a big theme of the seventies and eighties, as was Reclaim the Night.</p>
<p>Police are investigating the discovery of a woman&rsquo;s body on a playing field in the Chapel</p>
<p>Town district of Leeds. The woman who hasn&rsquo;t yet been identified was found by a milkman</p>
<p>on his early delivery round. Murder squad detectives&hellip;</p>
<p>So in 1977, you had Reclaim the Night, which was a response to the Yorkshire Ripper, who</p>
<p>was a serial killer of women. The Yorkshire Ripper. Like his Victorian predecessor,</p>
<p>Jack the Ripper, he mutilated his women victims. Sutcliffe murdered 13 women across Yorkshire</p>
<p>and the north-west of England between 1975 and 1980. He was also convicted of the attempted</p>
<p>murder of seven other women. And this provoked an enormous feminist backlash.</p>
<p>And the backlash really to the idea that women weren&rsquo;t safe in public spaces, you know,</p>
<p>that women were living under this constant threat of male violence and intimidation.</p>
<p>And that sparked marches all across the UK, in the world.</p>
<p>Night is magical for men. They hunt down random victims, find in the dark solace, sanction</p>
<p>and sanctuary. We will have to take back the night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much a feature of the culture in which I grew up, that women, by virtue of</p>
<p>their biology, are subjected to specific harms, specific pressures, and require certain protections.</p>
<p>And that that is inextricably linked with our biology. And we cannot fight for our rights</p>
<p>without naming and accurately describing what makes us different from men.</p>
<p>Rowling says that this was all foundational to her understanding of why feminism was necessary.</p>
<p>Because for generations, the reality of male violence and predation was a fact that had</p>
<p>been ignored, downplayed, and even excused, until feminists fought for it to be recognized</p>
<p>and remedied in as many ways as possible.</p>
<p>My feminism must remain grounded in the sex class and the oppressions my sex class suffer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basis for our oppression. That&rsquo;s my understanding of why certain things have</p>
<p>happened to me.</p>
<p>And of course, we now know that Rowling herself needed these protections and services in her</p>
<p>own life. And while watching these women fight for their rights, Rowling says she also watched</p>
<p>as they were constantly vilified for it.</p>
<p>British feminism faced all the same attacks that American feminism did, that it was being</p>
<p>carried out by ultra leftists, by overgrown student protesters, by people who were probably</p>
<p>lesbians or not normal women in some other sense.</p>
<p>Feminists were hugely disparaged across the mainstream. They were ugly. They didn&rsquo;t shave</p>
<p>their armpits. They were aggressive. They were butch. And I suppose I see real parallels</p>
<p>with now, with the slur that is TERF.</p>
<p>All the same tropes about a woman not behaving the way a woman is supposed to behave. You</p>
<p>know, all of the cliches.</p>
<p>Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit.</p>
<p>Which brings us to today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>This podcast is supported by Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>I am a person who can be pretty obsessive about my health. My routine typically includes</p>
<p>things like 10,000 steps a day and smoothies and strength workouts. And yes, I am even</p>
<p>one of those people who forces myself to take cold showers, even in the winter. But a lot</p>
<p>of that flew out the window when I had a baby six months ago. And I especially struggled</p>
<p>to make sure that I was getting good nutrition. That&rsquo;s why I was so excited to add AG1 from</p>
<p>Athletic Greens to my routine.</p>
<p>I love that I can get 75 vitamins, minerals, and nutrients from whole food sources just</p>
<p>by adding a scoop of AG1 to my smoothie in the morning, or mixing it with a glass of</p>
<p>cold water. It&rsquo;s a really simple habit to get into, and it&rsquo;s so much easier than</p>
<p>swallowing a bunch of pills, which is what I did for years and came to completely dread.</p>
<p>AG1 is different, and it makes me feel grateful that even during the most chaotic times in</p>
<p>my life, I can do this small, powerful thing to help me cover my nutritional bases every</p>
<p>day.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of decades, the fight for LGBT rights has experienced many landmark</p>
<p>victories.</p>
<p>Hugging, kissing, and toasting in the streets.</p>
<p>Most notably, the legalization of same-sex marriage in both the UK and the US.</p>
<p>An historic milestone for gay couples in England and Wales.</p>
<p>Just one of many same-sex unions today proudly under the banner of love, but now also under</p>
<p>the protection of the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Today we can say, in no uncertain terms, that we&rsquo;ve made our union a little more perfect.</p>
<p>Then, legal restrictions were dropped on same-sex couples&rsquo; ability to adopt children.</p>
<p>And a record number of LGBT candidates have been elected in races across the US.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of Fortune 500 companies protect their transgender employees.</p>
<p>Most major cities protect their transgender residents.</p>
<p>Starting today, transgender individuals may openly join the US military.</p>
<p>And in just the last decade, trans rights and acceptance in particular have come into</p>
<p>the spotlight.</p>
<p>Culturally, with the visibility of trans celebrities like Laverne Cox and Caitlyn</p>
<p>Jenner, but also through a series of big institutional wins, from the dropping of</p>
<p>restrictions on military service to the Bostock decision from the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has ruled that LGBT Americans are protected by the anti-discrimination</p>
<p>laws of this country.</p>
<p>Which in 2020, ruled that trans citizens have equal protection under the law and cannot</p>
<p>be discriminated against in areas like housing and the workplace.</p>
<p>This is a major civil rights opinion.</p>
<p>And yet‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Overnight, protesters taking their battle cry for transgender rights directly to the</p>
<p>White House.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also been a backlash to some of these gains.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s from President Trump, who overturned Obama-era protections for trans</p>
<p>health care and military service.</p>
<p>Or populist leaders across the world, figures like Viktor Orban in Hungary, who are stoking</p>
<p>attacks on the very legitimacy of LGBT identities altogether.</p>
<p>But that was not the fight that J.K.</p>
<p>Rowling would eventually step into.</p>
<p>I think the hardest thing for outsiders to understand is that there are two different</p>
<p>arguments going on.</p>
<p>One is the traditional conservative right argument, which is anti-LGBT.</p>
<p>So someone like Viktor Orban in Hungary doesn&rsquo;t think people should be allowed to transition</p>
<p>and, you know, wants to take away that right from them.</p>
<p>Which is part of a broader idea that kind of LGBT identities are decadent and postmodern</p>
<p>and, you know, are going to sort of sap the vital life force out of the country.</p>
<p>That is one criticism of modern LGBT politics.</p>
<p>The other one is a criticism from the left, in which it says sometimes male people and</p>
<p>female people have different interests, no matter how the male people identify.</p>
<p>And we need to work out those conflicts in policy and law.</p>
<p>Recently, a conflict has been growing within the political left, among many of the very</p>
<p>same people who have long fought for and cheered on these recent gains in LGBT rights.</p>
<p>A conflict about whether sometimes the fight for trans rights is ever at odds with the</p>
<p>hard-won gains of the women&rsquo;s rights movement.</p>
<p>That is very different from saying someone&rsquo;s a pervert or a degenerate, right?</p>
<p>It says you are perfectly free to live your life.</p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid identity to adopt.</p>
<p>However, there might be times when it comes into conflict with other identities.</p>
<p>Take, for example, women&rsquo;s sports.</p>
<p>Transgender swimmer Leah Thomas is breaking barriers and records.</p>
<p>Leah Thomas to the wall first.</p>
<p>And that is a new Ivy League meeting record.</p>
<p>Recently, a swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>who competed on the men&rsquo;s team as a freshman, sophomore and junior,</p>
<p>transitioned and began competing on the women&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>Leah Thomas dominated this weekend&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s swimming Ivy League championships.</p>
<p>Not only winning major championships, but also breaking women&rsquo;s swimming records.</p>
<p>Thomas is eligible to compete under NCAA rules, which require transgender athletes</p>
<p>to complete at least one year of testosterone suppression treatments.</p>
<p>This prompted many to come out and argue that it&rsquo;s unfair for someone who went</p>
<p>through male puberty to join the women&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>Because, they argued, the athletic advantages that come with male puberty</p>
<p>cannot be fully erased with hormone therapy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to be able to remove male physical advantage.</p>
<p>Not all of it.</p>
<p>You know, you may be able to remove a third of it,</p>
<p>or you may even be able to remove a half of it.</p>
<p>This included Olympic athletes like Sharon Davies, Michael Phelps.</p>
<p>I believe that we all should feel comfortable with who we are in our own skin.</p>
<p>But I think sports should all be played at an even playing field.</p>
<p>And Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
<p>It is just not fair.</p>
<p>And also, feminists.</p>
<p>At the heart of all of this, there really are just two issues that people feel strongly about.</p>
<p>Fairness in sports, on one hand,</p>
<p>and the importance of acceptance and inclusion on the other.</p>
<p>Many of these feminists point out that they have fought hard,</p>
<p>and are still fighting, for funding and resources for women&rsquo;s sports.</p>
<p>And they see a real conflict in interest here that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>But some trans athletes, like Thomas, ask,</p>
<p>how is this situation all that different from the fact that</p>
<p>there are real physical variations between all individuals?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a medical expert, but there&rsquo;s a lot of variation among cis female athletes.</p>
<p>Quick note, the term cis refers to people who are not transgender.</p>
<p>There are cis women who are very tall and very muscular</p>
<p>and have more testosterone than another cis woman.</p>
<p>And should that then also disqualify them?</p>
<p>And many trans advocates say that attempts to prohibit trans women and girls</p>
<p>from playing women&rsquo;s sports is a form of bigotry.</p>
<p>And this conflict becomes both more complicated and more contentious</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not women&rsquo;s sports at issue, but women&rsquo;s spaces.</p>
<p>Spaces like women&rsquo;s bathrooms, locker rooms, domestic violence shelters, and even prisons.</p>
<p>In recent years, that tension has become much more urgent,</p>
<p>especially for some feminists in the UK,</p>
<p>because of a proposed legal change that&rsquo;s often referred to as self-ID.</p>
<p>Well, campaigners are worried about potential changes to the Gender Recognition Act,</p>
<p>which would allow men and women to choose their own gender,</p>
<p>arguing it could enable predatory men to abuse women in single-sex spaces.</p>
<p>The legal suggestion that it was going to be made much easier to change your legal gender</p>
<p>was what made this not just an abstract discussion among feminists and queer theorists,</p>
<p>but a matter of quite urgent public policy in Britain.</p>
<p>For years in the UK, if a trans person wanted to be fully recognized by the government</p>
<p>as their preferred gender, they needed to go through a medical evaluation</p>
<p>and receive a diagnosis of gender dysphoria,</p>
<p>which essentially is an intense discomfort that people can feel</p>
<p>if their gender identity does not match their body.</p>
<p>But this proposed change would allow people to alter their legal sex or gender</p>
<p>based largely on, as the name suggests, their self-declared gender identity,</p>
<p>without any medical requirements or diagnosis at all.</p>
<p>It was a change some trans people wanted,</p>
<p>in part because they felt that the need for a diagnosis was stigmatizing.</p>
<p>The arguments came about the idea that, as it stands, the procedure involves gatekeeping.</p>
<p>You know, you need to prove to doctors that you&rsquo;re trans,</p>
<p>which is exactly what the trans activists hated about it,</p>
<p>the idea that someone else gets the final stamp on your very personal identity.</p>
<p>But the feminist argument was that some level of gatekeeping</p>
<p>was necessary in order to safeguard single-sex spaces.</p>
<p>In other words, the removal of that need for a medical diagnosis,</p>
<p>the elimination of that gatekeeping, concerned some feminists,</p>
<p>especially those shaped by movements like Take Back the Night.</p>
<p>They worried that predatory males would find some way to take advantage of these looser requirements</p>
<p>to harm women and girls.</p>
<p>They were concerned that, in a good faith effort to make things easier for trans people,</p>
<p>the government was aggravating risks to women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in it.</p>
<p>And I did a lot of reading around it.</p>
<p>And as this public debate grew, one of those concerned feminists was J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>So I was already aware that the activism was arguing for this kind of self-identification.</p>
<p>Therefore, an entirely male-bodied male can, by self-declaration, become,</p>
<p>in inverted commas, a woman.</p>
<p>Conceptually, as it were.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now conceptually a woman.</p>
<p>And I was troubled by that activism, because after a long life dealing with certain issues,</p>
<p>whether as a donor or an activist myself, or from being a woman,</p>
<p>I think I have a very realistic view, not a scaremongering view,</p>
<p>on what may happen when you loosen boundaries around single-sex spaces for women and girls.</p>
<p>So that troubled me.</p>
<p>Have you thought through what this could mean for women and girls?</p>
<p>I can already hear the screams of outrage.</p>
<p>You are saying that trans people are all predators.</p>
<p>Of course I am not.</p>
<p>Any more that I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happily married straight woman.</p>
<p>I know perfectly well all men aren&rsquo;t predators.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>I have good men in my life who are among my favorite people.</p>
<p>But I am also aware that 98 to 99% of sexual offenses are caused by those born with penises.</p>
<p>The problem is male violence.</p>
<p>All a predator wants is access.</p>
<p>And to open the doors of changing rooms or rape centers, domestic violence centers,</p>
<p>to open the doors to any male who says, I&rsquo;m a woman and I have the right to be here,</p>
<p>it will constitute a risk to women and girls.</p>
<p>Now, that actually has very little to do with trans people</p>
<p>and a lot to do with what we know are the risks from men to women.</p>
<p>But this is the flashpoint.</p>
<p>The activists who would argue against me, I&rsquo;ve seen them say, but these are now women.</p>
<p>And I say, well, here is where what a woman is becomes hugely important.</p>
<p>And I also asked myself a question I think is such a useful and basic question to ask yourself.</p>
<p>If you want to ascertain whether you&rsquo;re being intellectually honest,</p>
<p>what proof would I need to see to change my opinion?</p>
<p>And so I asked myself that question.</p>
<p>Okay, so I thought, well, it&rsquo;s being claimed that nobody has ever abused dressing as the</p>
<p>opposite sex and no trans woman has ever presented a physical threat to a woman in an intimate space.</p>
<p>Obviously, if I go looking and there&rsquo;s literally no evidence that&rsquo;s ever happened,</p>
<p>well, then clearly my fears are baseless.</p>
<p>So I went and looked and it&rsquo;s with no pleasure that I say that there was</p>
<p>very clear evidence that that had happened.</p>
<p>Our top story tonight, a transgender prisoner sexually attacked inmates in a female jail.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a famous case in England of a trans woman called Karen White who was</p>
<p>convicted of sexual offences and sent to a women&rsquo;s prison and then sexually assaulted two women.</p>
<p>The court heard how she used her transgender persona</p>
<p>to put herself in contact with vulnerable women.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d ended up in the female Newhall prison at Wakefield on remand</p>
<p>after a number of sexual offences, including rape.</p>
<p>Tonight, questions about how someone who&rsquo;d raped women and who claimed to be transgender</p>
<p>ended up in a female jail before undergoing any proper gender reassignment</p>
<p>and was able to abuse fellow inmates.</p>
<p>That happened and it was quite a big moment, I think, for UK feminism,</p>
<p>for all these people who&rsquo;d been told that this would never happen,</p>
<p>to finally have evidence that in fact it had happened.</p>
<p>Can you articulate where those on the opposing side of this debate are coming from?</p>
<p>Like, what is the steel man, good faith way to understand the argument that says</p>
<p>if your gender identity is female, then medical transition or not,</p>
<p>you should be housed in a women&rsquo;s prison?</p>
<p>There is a completely reasonable argument,</p>
<p>which is that trans women are particularly at risk of sexual violence in male prisons.</p>
<p>And that is a fact.</p>
<p>There are lots of groups who are vulnerable, particularly in male prisons.</p>
<p>Male prisons are, in any case, a really horrible place to be.</p>
<p>The conditions are horrible.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re violent, tense places to be.</p>
<p>And, you know, America, with its much greater rates of incarceration,</p>
<p>those problems are amplified.</p>
<p>So I do think there is a completely reasonable point to say,</p>
<p>if you are a trans woman who has been convicted of a non-violent crime,</p>
<p>is it going to be a huge risk to your safety to be put in a men&rsquo;s prison?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>And the conclusion that Britain has come to, really,</p>
<p>is that people with a gender recognition certificate,</p>
<p>that is people who have legally fully transitioned,</p>
<p>the presumption should be that they should be in the female estate.</p>
<p>And then for everybody else, it&rsquo;s an individual case conference.</p>
<p>But with the presumption that if you&rsquo;re convicted of a violent or sexual crime,</p>
<p>you cannot be safely held in the women&rsquo;s prison estate.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happened in America at all.</p>
<p>And the ACLU, the great liberal organisation,</p>
<p>have been fighting on behalf of trans women,</p>
<p>some of whom have been convicted of violent offences,</p>
<p>to stay in the women&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>And that is very alarming to me.</p>
<p>The ACLU has also been fighting on behalf of trans people</p>
<p>when it comes to bathroom access.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a similar argument playing out there.</p>
<p>Feminists are concerned when they hear of assaults by trans women,</p>
<p>or males who pose as trans women, in public bathrooms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one well-publicised example that involves an attack</p>
<p>on a 10-year-old girl in Scotland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare, but it does happen.</p>
<p>There are extensively documented cases of it.</p>
<p>However, we should be really careful that we shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>play into a moral panic narrative that says that,</p>
<p>you know, people are going to transition just to predate on people.</p>
<p>The thing I would say is that predators exploit any loophole that they can.</p>
<p>You know, and that is something that we should always be alert to.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing safeguarding,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have a kind of rosy view of humanity.</p>
<p>You have to look at what the worst that could happen is.</p>
<p>So I think while maintaining that it is rare,</p>
<p>I think you have to acknowledge that it happens.</p>
<p>Because assaults in bathrooms are so rare,</p>
<p>trans people often find it galling and humiliating</p>
<p>when decision-makers try to force them to use the bathroom of their sex at birth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just routine. Like, everyone goes to the restroom,</p>
<p>everyone gets out. It&rsquo;s nothing, nothing. It&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>Many trans people report that they avoid public bathrooms as it is</p>
<p>out of fear of being called out or even attacked.</p>
<p>And this makes it difficult for them to just be in public</p>
<p>at a concert or a stadium, but even more importantly, at work or at school.</p>
<p>And advocates ask, when the risk to others is low,</p>
<p>why impose interventions that could make this tough situation any harder?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>You go do your business, then you wash your hands, and then you leave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simple.</p>
<p>And when people make a big deal about it,</p>
<p>it just kind of gets blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>In an increasingly polarized world, gender issues have become the front line,</p>
<p>and it can be hard to know where to start, how to express an opinion,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s even okay to voice one.</p>
<p>Yet as the chasm between opposing views increases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vulnerable children who&rsquo;ve fallen into the abyss.</p>
<p>And finally, the issue that&rsquo;s brought this once-obscure debate</p>
<p>into the center of culture is the medical transition of young people.</p>
<p>Child transition.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s particularly acute because the composition</p>
<p>of the group of people trying to transition as children has changed,</p>
<p>and it has grown enormously.</p>
<p>Now, in recent years, there&rsquo;s been a huge increase</p>
<p>in the number of children reporting gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re talking about a difference in Britain</p>
<p>between a couple of hundred people a year,</p>
<p>two thousands a year in the last decade or so.</p>
<p>The clinics here and in London see 3,000% more patients than they did 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Among girls, referrals are up more than 5,000%.</p>
<p>Across the Western world, there has been a sharp rise</p>
<p>in the number of minors who are seeking to transition,</p>
<p>especially among young females.</p>
<p>And in just the U.S., the number of clinics that help young people transition</p>
<p>has grown from zero to more than 100 in just the past 15 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question this service is helping children</p>
<p>who feel distressed in their own bodies.</p>
<p>But the full impact of children making decisions about their gender</p>
<p>at such young ages may not truly be clear until much later in their lives.</p>
<p>5,000 children were referred to the clinic last year,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a 20-fold increase on the number a decade ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s huge, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely something going on there,</p>
<p>and whether or not those people are getting the right treatment is a big question</p>
<p>when the treatments are themselves so new.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very fraught question indeed.</p>
<p>One controversy related to child transition</p>
<p>is a treatment often referred to as puberty blockers.</p>
<p>Now, these drugs are not new.</p>
<p>For decades, they&rsquo;ve been used to treat a condition</p>
<p>where a child begins puberty early, sometimes as young as age 6 or 7.</p>
<p>Blockers halt that development,</p>
<p>and then a child can resume the process years later alongside their peers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very different use case than the modern way of using them for trans children,</p>
<p>which is to block puberty in your natal sex</p>
<p>and then go straight on to cross-sex hormones from the other sex.</p>
<p>Young people with gender dysphoria tend to be extremely distressed by their changing bodies,</p>
<p>so gender clinicians began using these drugs off-label to halt their puberty,</p>
<p>and then later might introduce cross-sex hormones.</p>
<p>So, for example, a female would grow facial hair, or a male would develop breast tissue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been concerned for some time that there are providers</p>
<p>who are not following the standards of care,</p>
<p>which historically have invoked the need for an individualized,</p>
<p>comprehensive biopsychosocial evaluation prior to the initiation of medicines.</p>
<p>This is Dr. Erica Anderson,</p>
<p>a psychologist who has worked extensively with transgender youth,</p>
<p>and who is herself a transgender woman.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also a former board member of WPATH,</p>
<p>the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.</p>
<p>As Dr. Anderson told me, WPATH recommends that</p>
<p>before prescribing interventions like puberty blockers,</p>
<p>clinicians should methodically evaluate a young person,</p>
<p>that they should take time with a minor and their parents to investigate any underlying conditions,</p>
<p>and make sure that this is the right treatment for each individual.</p>
<p>But puberty blockers have become a flashpoint in part because some clinicians</p>
<p>do not appear to be following those guidelines.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve seen in the USA, and this has been reported elsewhere,</p>
<p>is that there are some young people who are going to providers</p>
<p>and obtaining puberty blockers and hormones,</p>
<p>but not having a full mental health evaluation.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s sloppy and bad practice.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, it has become increasingly common for parents and doctors</p>
<p>to adopt an approach where they affirm a child when they say they&rsquo;re trans.</p>
<p>But Dr. Anderson says that some well-meaning clinics and doctors have gone further than that,</p>
<p>and that in their attempts to support gender non-conforming kids,</p>
<p>they have stopped asking important questions,</p>
<p>and often too quickly accept a child&rsquo;s self-assessment.</p>
<p>Some trans advocates argue that that&rsquo;s exactly what clinics should be doing,</p>
<p>as this popular TikTok video explains.</p>
<p>No one says that cisgender kids are too young to know that they are cisgender.</p>
<p>No, cisgender kids are pretty much always trusted to know their gender identity.</p>
<p>If cisgender kids are young enough to know that they are not transgender,</p>
<p>then transgender kids are young enough to know that they are transgender.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as simple as that.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson says that, especially when dealing with kids,</p>
<p>you need to ensure that you&rsquo;re diagnosing them correctly,</p>
<p>just as you would with any other medical condition.</p>
<p>But in addition, child and adolescent brains are still developing,</p>
<p>so rushing a young person into gender transition</p>
<p>without a full evaluation of other co-occurring conditions is bad practice.</p>
<p>And this, to me, flies in the face of the history of medicine,</p>
<p>clinical medicine and clinical psychology,</p>
<p>which the hallmark of which is an individualized evaluation before you provide treatment.</p>
<p>This concern on my part is further accentuated by the phenomenon</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve also seen in the last few years,</p>
<p>which is a flood of young people going to gender clinics expressing gender variance</p>
<p>way out of proportion to what we&rsquo;ve ever seen before</p>
<p>and in numbers that are not entirely understandable.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson and other clinicians still believe there are benefits</p>
<p>to using puberty blockers for some kids with gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>But they are also urging caution,</p>
<p>especially to doctors who offer these treatments</p>
<p>based largely on a young person&rsquo;s request for them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s partly because these treatments,</p>
<p>puberty blockers followed by hormone therapy,</p>
<p>can lead to infertility and,</p>
<p>for young males whose puberty is blocked in its early stages,</p>
<p>a high likelihood of never experiencing an orgasm.</p>
<p>She says that doctors need to ensure that these treatments</p>
<p>are being provided just to those who need them</p>
<p>and that they aren&rsquo;t misdiagnosing patients.</p>
<p>Ruby began identifying as male at 13 years old.</p>
<p>Now, 21, she&rsquo;d been planning to have surgery to remove her breasts.</p>
<p>But in May, she made the decision to come off testosterone</p>
<p>and detransition to identify as female her sex at birth.</p>
<p>Stories about young people who regret their decision to transition</p>
<p>have been well publicized in recent years.</p>
<p>They often say that, as children,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t capable of consenting to treatments with lifelong consequences</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t truly comprehend.</p>
<p>Others say they wish clinicians had spent more time</p>
<p>looking into their other mental health issues</p>
<p>before recommending medical transition.</p>
<p>One of these young women spoke with Sky News.</p>
<p>Ruby now feels her eating disorder was more of a factor</p>
<p>than she first realized in her gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>None of the therapists that I spoke to brought that up.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think that it was linked.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>I think so, yes, because they&rsquo;re both kind of based in how I feel about my body.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen similarities between the two.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s currently no data for how many in the trans community detransition</p>
<p>and to talk about it can be viewed as transphobic.</p>
<p>But people like Ruby say more discussion is needed</p>
<p>as well as more options for people with gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>Accounts like these have served as confirmation for those concerned</p>
<p>that young people are not getting the support they need.</p>
<p>At the same time, they&rsquo;ve been a source of deep frustration</p>
<p>to many trans advocates who say that regret is rare</p>
<p>and that we should trust kids to know that they are who they say they are</p>
<p>rather than putting them through months or years-long evaluations.</p>
<p>What complicates all of this is that the protocols for youth gender care are so new.</p>
<p>The current president of WPATH, Dr. Marcy Bowers,</p>
<p>cites a figure that about 80% of the research on youth gender medicine</p>
<p>has been done in just the last 10 years.</p>
<p>And though there are currently no authoritative long-term studies</p>
<p>about the phenomenon of detransition,</p>
<p>nor about the overall effectiveness of some of these treatments in minors,</p>
<p>Finland, Sweden, and the UK are all currently re-evaluating their youth gender treatments</p>
<p>and calling for more resources, more studies, and tighter protocols to be put in place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleasant as adolescence is.</p>
<p>I mean, I hated adolescence.</p>
<p>I do not romanticize adolescence.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a dreadful time.</p>
<p>I remember times of pure joy when I was with my friends and I remember fun.</p>
<p>But if you ask me, do you want to go back to being 13 tomorrow and live it all again,</p>
<p>I would say absolutely bloody not.</p>
<p>I want to stay exactly where I am.</p>
<p>But I do think that it is a necessary part of our development.</p>
<p>Rowling told me that watching this sharp rise in youth transition,</p>
<p>especially the rise among young females,</p>
<p>started to feel like a particularly feminist concern</p>
<p>and something that resonated with her from her own childhood.</p>
<p>I grew up in what I would say was quite a misogynistic household.</p>
<p>Like all young girls, I grew up with certain standards of beauty and ideals of femininity.</p>
<p>And I felt I didn&rsquo;t fit into either of those groups.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel particularly feminine.</p>
<p>And I certainly didn&rsquo;t feel, you know, that I looked the way I was supposed to look.</p>
<p>I looked very androgynous at 11 and 12.</p>
<p>I had short hair.</p>
<p>And I can certainly remember in adolescence feeling acutely anxious.</p>
<p>I think this is so common.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I know more women who have felt it than not.</p>
<p>I felt very, very anxious about my changing body.</p>
<p>Because you become aware it&rsquo;s attracting scrutiny that you don&rsquo;t welcome.</p>
<p>You know, I can remember the comments about your body,</p>
<p>the difficulty of dealing with periods, period shaming,</p>
<p>particularly from boys at school,</p>
<p>this sort of squeamish fascination that young men have with female bodies</p>
<p>that is a mixture of disgust and desire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to cope with that.</p>
<p>I question my sexuality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, well, I can tell my friends are pretty.</p>
<p>Does that mean I&rsquo;m gay?</p>
<p>Which I think is very common.</p>
<p>I grew up to be a straight woman.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never forgotten that feeling of anxiety around my body.</p>
<p>So is it your position that it&rsquo;s too big of a decision essentially for a child to make,</p>
<p>to transition and experience these long-term consequences that they can&rsquo;t yet comprehend?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t believe even a 14-year-old</p>
<p>can truly understand what the loss of their fertility is.</p>
<p>At 14, if you&rsquo;d said to me, do you want children?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have said, no, I don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>But it has been the most joyful, wonderful thing in my life.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I think everyone should have kids.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean I think to be a woman, you need to have kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking very personally.</p>
<p>For me, my children have been an unmatched joy and I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t have comprehended that at 14.</p>
<p>I would have had no idea what I was giving up.</p>
<p>And yet, as I sat with Rowling and listened to her views about youth transition,</p>
<p>it was clear that they aren&rsquo;t black and white.</p>
<p>My feeling is, and it&rsquo;s a feeling that was strongly expressed in the Potter books,</p>
<p>that as many diverse life experiences as possible should be explored and expressed.</p>
<p>And having felt like an outsider in several different ways in my life,</p>
<p>I have a real feeling for the underdog.</p>
<p>And I have a real feeling for people who feel they don&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>And I see that hugely, particularly among younger trans people.</p>
<p>I can understand that feeling only too well.</p>
<p>But seeing this recent surge in numbers seemed like something worth questioning soberly.</p>
<p>Gender dysphoria exists.</p>
<p>It causes massive distress.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>And I know there will be, I believe, a minority of people for whom this will be a solution.</p>
<p>But in the numbers we&rsquo;re currently seeing, particularly of young people coming forward,</p>
<p>I find cause for doubt and cause for concern.</p>
<p>So I did what I always tend to do when in that situation.</p>
<p>So I read a ton of books.</p>
<p>That is my instinct.</p>
<p>I, if I&rsquo;m interested&hellip;</p>
<p>Rowling said that she went out and bought some of the big best-selling memoirs by trans authors.</p>
<p>Out of this gender identity movement.</p>
<p>So Jacob Tobias, Sissy, Andrea Long Chu, brilliant writer, females.</p>
<p>Gender Games, The Trouble With Men.</p>
<p>She read essays.</p>
<p>Is Gender Fluid, Dr. Sally White.</p>
<p>And academic literature from influential thinkers like Judith Butler.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m reading countless blogs and articles.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to have your views challenged.</p>
<p>Completely, because I really want to understand what is the thinking</p>
<p>through personal experience, but also the philosophy, the ideology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at this, I&rsquo;m thinking, am I missing something?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>Before I married him.</p>
<p>I do not have a good history with plants.</p>

<p>And now that our daughter is four years old, I wanted to make sure that my</p>
<p>arboreal deficiencies aren&rsquo;t passed along for another generation.</p>

<p>Over the months and years that Rowling was immersing herself in queer theory</p>
<p>and memoirs of different trans thinkers,</p>
<p>this conflict between some feminists and trans activists continued to escalate.</p>
<p>The debates due to start in an hour and suddenly protestors come in wearing masks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting on an event tonight, we&rsquo;ve got all these young people in bandanas</p>
<p>trying to force their way in. They&rsquo;ve got faces covered.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually being aggressive and violent.</p>
<p>In the past few years, as the feminists have tried to organise meetings and debates</p>
<p>to discuss everything from women&rsquo;s sports,</p>
<p>to self-ID, to the proper treatment of gender dysphoria in kids,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been met with protestors trying to shut them down.</p>
<p>These are trans activists protesting outside a feminist meeting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shouting TERF. It stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists.</p>
<p>Across the country, clashes are erupting between the two groups.</p>
<p>These activists say that</p>
<p>trans women are women, full stop.</p>
<p>And to them, to engage in a debate at all is to engage in transphobic hate speech.</p>
<p>And then we come to the famous two-word slogan, the stock phrase,</p>
<p>no debate, no debate, no debate. We hear it all the time.</p>
<p>That alarms me, really alarms me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a purer instance of authoritarianism than no debate.</p>
<p>In fact, that is the attitude of the fundamentalist.</p>
<p>You may not challenge my ideas. That makes you evil.</p>
<p>I am righteous. I don&rsquo;t have to explain my righteousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to explain my righteousness.</p>
<p>And I am entitled, therefore, to bully you, to harass you, to silence you,</p>
<p>to take away your livelihood, all the way up to attacking you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had things thrown at me. I&rsquo;ve been accused of things I have never done or said.</p>
<p>People seem to have no concern about evidence or even about libel.</p>
<p>Many of the feminists labeled as TERFs have been attacked and received death threats,</p>
<p>along with accusations that, despite what they say, they are actually Nazis and fascists.</p>
<p>There have been physical assaults. A woman called Maria McLaughlin,</p>
<p>she was at Speaker&rsquo;s Corner in London, which is an infamous site for freedom of speech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where people can go say whatever they like, pretty much.</p>
<p>And she went there to a feminist meeting and she was physically assaulted.</p>
<p>By a trans woman called Tara Wolf, who was convicted of assault,</p>
<p>who had said online before going to that meeting, I want to fuck up some TERFs.</p>
<p>You know, when I cover this subject, I often say that afterwards I need to relax by covering</p>
<p>something uncontroversial like Israel-Palestine or abortion, right? It&rsquo;s extremely fraught.</p>
<p>This is Michelle Goldberg, reporter and columnist at The New York Times.</p>
<p>And one reason it&rsquo;s extremely fraught is that you have two groups of people who feel,</p>
<p>legitimately feel, extremely embattled.</p>
<p>You wrote about this conflict in The New Yorker in 2014 in an article called,</p>
<p>What is a Woman? And even back then, you talked about how intense the threats</p>
<p>and intimidation tactics were towards feminists who were voicing these views.</p>
<p>You quote some of the online threats in the article, which said things like,</p>
<p>Kill TERFs 2014. How about slowly and horrendously murder TERFs in saw-like</p>
<p>torture machines and contraptions? A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with a caption,</p>
<p>Fetch me a TERF. Such threats, you write,</p>
<p>have become so common that radical feminist websites have taken to cataloging them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, those quotes that you just read,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think those people are representative of the trans rights movement.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, there&rsquo;s a lot of feminists who feel like aggrieved at people kind of</p>
<p>constantly saying, if you don&rsquo;t recognize me as a woman, I&rsquo;m going to rape you.</p>
<p>They just, they feel like there is this very vicious online dialogue in which</p>
<p>a really brute sort of misogyny is dressed up in progressive clothes. And so, you know,</p>
<p>to add insult to injury, you&rsquo;re not even supposed to complain about it within feminist spaces.</p>
<p>It should be possible to have a discussion where there are a range of different people</p>
<p>who can enter into a dialogue about this.</p>
<p>These feminists believe that their views are not only inside the bounds of respectable discourse,</p>
<p>but also that the accusations that they are violent transphobes feels less like a sincere</p>
<p>criticism and more like an attempt to smear them so that no one will listen to them.</p>
<p>I mean, what we&rsquo;re seeing in the world is more and more people shutting down free speech. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>censoring ideas. You&rsquo;re shutting down controversy.</p>
<p>And in a democratic society, that&rsquo;s how we come to a better understanding of each other.</p>
<p>And beyond just online insults, this approach from activists has had real-life consequences.</p>
<p>Women expressing these views have lost their jobs. In publishing, in academia, in journalism,</p>
<p>and the arts. Women athletes have been dropped by advertisers. Authors dropped from book deals.</p>
<p>For voicing her concerns, Dr. Erica Anderson, a trans woman who&rsquo;s helped dozens of kids medically</p>
<p>transition, has been labeled a TERF and disinvited from public events.</p>
<p>Michelle, from your reporting on this over the years, what is the best way to understand the</p>
<p>side of the protesters in this conflict? The people who are calling to silence these debates,</p>
<p>where are they coming from? And what do they feel is at stake in all of this?</p>
<p>Well, look, what&rsquo;s at stake for a lot of people is just the ability to</p>
<p>live their lives with any sort of dignity and security. And again, I just want to emphasize,</p>
<p>and I hope this makes it into the podcast, that that is why I think the temperature of this is</p>
<p>so high. Because, you know, especially in the United States, trans people are so embattled.</p>
<p>You know, you have these sweeping oppressive laws.</p>
<p>119 anti-transgender bills have been introduced in state legislatures this year alone.</p>
<p>Suing the state of Alabama after the governor signed it.</p>
<p>Making their way through Ohio&rsquo;s legislature.</p>
<p>Arkansas passing a bill blocking gender-affirming care for trans.</p>
<p>Activists are calling the move an attack on the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>Despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that protects transgender Americans from discrimination,</p>
<p>and despite President Biden overturning the Trump-era policies against trans healthcare</p>
<p>and military service, there have been hundreds of proposed or recently passed laws that have</p>
<p>sought to limit trans people&rsquo;s access to bathrooms, their participation in girls'</p>
<p>and women&rsquo;s sports, and to restrict medical transition for minors.</p>
<p>And some of the laws come with severe penalties.</p>
<p>Last week, Alabama became the third state in the nation to pass a measure restricting</p>
<p>gender-affirming care for transgender and non-binary youth. But it&rsquo;s the first state</p>
<p>to actually impose criminal penalties. The law would make providing that care a felony,</p>
<p>punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Additionally, online, just as there are some trans advocates who send violent and harassing</p>
<p>threats toward the people they call TERFs, there are also many others, often coming from</p>
<p>the right and the alt-right, who send violent and harassing threats towards trans activists</p>
<p>and their allies. Some based on accusations that any attempt to teach kids about trans identities</p>
<p>is actually a smokescreen for a desire to sexually exploit young children.</p>
<p>And in this climate, many activists feel that feminists calling for open dialogue and good</p>
<p>faith debate are really just opening them up to greater harm.</p>
<p>I think that what is so painful for them is that, you know, they feel like these issues</p>
<p>of daily survival are being treated as secondary to culture war flashpoints, you know, around</p>
<p>these kind of relatively few handful of cases involving women&rsquo;s sports. These few cases where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really hard calls about things like prisons or domestic violence shelters. And</p>
<p>people that I&rsquo;ve spoken to feel that the intense focus on these issues is itself kind of undermining</p>
<p>them, right? That like they feel so under siege. And when people are really scared and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really under siege, then they don&rsquo;t want to have a kind of searching, probing conversation about the</p>
<p>legitimacy of their identity for kind of obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t want to hear debates about, you know, nuanced issues when they feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fighting for basic rights. Right. I mean, I think you&rsquo;ll often hear</p>
<p>people say, you know, I&rsquo;m not going to debate my basic humanity. And part of the difficulty</p>
<p>is that there are indeed certain issues which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively</p>
<p>with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate. And I think that part of</p>
<p>what is so difficult about this issue is that there are certain people who think that this</p>
<p>kind of consensus can be imposed maybe as opposed to evolve organically. And so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sort of desperately trying to shore it up in the hopes, I think, that if they can, they</p>
<p>will enjoy the same sort of assumed protection as other groups whose rights we&rsquo;ve decided</p>
<p>are not up for public conversation. I think the problem is that we don&rsquo;t actually have</p>
<p>a consensus about what gender means or what makes someone a boy or girl or woman or man.</p>
<p>And so you still have to talk these things out and have these conversations. And I think</p>
<p>there are plenty of trans people who believe that. But the people who are policing the discourse</p>
<p>have maybe outsized visibility. Okay. So let&rsquo;s go back to 2016, 2017.</p>
<p>You obviously are a very public person. You are not shy in general about speaking your mind.</p>
<p>And it seems like you&rsquo;ve had really strong views about what you were reading and you had done a</p>
<p>ton of reading and research and thinking. Did you want to join the public conversation at the time?</p>
<p>Did I want to join the public conversation? Yes. Why did I want to join it? Because I was watching</p>
<p>women being shut down. And it was as though there was no woman perfect enough to say her piece.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s a regular woman with no particular platform, she&rsquo;s a bigot. That&rsquo;s that. You&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>bigot. If she&rsquo;s an informed woman who is working in a sphere where this will really have an impact,</p>
<p>and for example, I saw a prison governor speaking out, this is not okay. These are already</p>
<p>traumatized women. Huge abuse hurled at her. Shut up. You don&rsquo;t really understand. What do you know</p>
<p>about being a trans woman? It seemed there was always a way to shut down women&rsquo;s voices. People</p>
<p>are terrified, terrified of speaking up. So I really was starting to feel this moral obligation.</p>
<p>I knew what was coming, but I thought other people, there are people who probably, if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>honest, probably could speak and don&rsquo;t want to speak. They&rsquo;re not going to lose their livelihoods.</p>
<p>But there are a ton of women who are being forced not to speak because they literally won&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>rent. So I actually wanted to join the conversation and speak up earlier than I did.</p>
<p>And I was not held back. I&rsquo;m not saying that I couldn&rsquo;t have done it anyway,</p>
<p>but there were people close to me who were begging me not to do it. I think out of concern</p>
<p>of what that would mean, they&rsquo;d watched what had happened to other public figures.</p>
<p>And there was certainly a feeling of this is not a wise thing to do. Don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m living in this state, once again, actually, I&rsquo;m living in what I feel is a duplicitous state.</p>
<p>I have this massive concern. I&rsquo;m watching women being shut down and bullied. Their employers</p>
<p>being targeted by a movement that I see as authoritarian, illiberal. I&rsquo;m hugely concerned</p>
<p>about young people, often the kind of young people who found a refuge in my books.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s a feeling of empathy there because I was one of those young people myself.</p>
<p>And I absolutely can say that I was living in a state of real tension, similar to when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>planning to leave my ex-husband, because although I am not physically in danger,</p>
<p>I feel I am lying by omission. I should speak up. I feel the right thing here is to try and</p>
<p>force this conversation because on behalf of people I&rsquo;m seeing shut down, who do not have my</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>Insulation, right?</p>
<p>It is insulation. It is. Privileged white woman. Absolutely. I am protected in ways I never</p>
<p>dreamt I would be protected. Of course, I&rsquo;m also exposed to threats that other people sometimes</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t exposed to. But it&rsquo;s more than that. Whatever happens, if everyone decides you</p>
<p>are an evil witch, we will never buy your books again. I can feed my family. We all know I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>My world doesn&rsquo;t crash. My kids don&rsquo;t go hungry. I once lived that life. You know, that was the</p>
<p>potential of making a bad financial decision and spending two pounds too much one week.</p>
<p>So I reached a point of high tension and I have to say something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying you felt obligated.</p>
<p>Yeah, there did come a point where I felt obligated because I felt,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m being contacted by women. And by the way, these women aren&rsquo;t even saying to me,</p>
<p>do it, do it, you do it. No one&rsquo;s trying to coerce me into it. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>these conversations and the climate of fear was scaring me more than speaking out. You know,</p>
<p>what are we letting happen here? This is insane that there&rsquo;s this much fear around a woman</p>
<p>arguing that she has the right to describe her life and her body in any way she chooses. This</p>
<p>is insanely regressive. But also I did reach a point where I thought I can&rsquo;t keep living with</p>
<p>myself if I don&rsquo;t say something. So it was personal as well. I have to speak. I just have to.</p>
<p>Believe you me, I did not feel any sense of joy in that. I didn&rsquo;t think, yippee,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for this. This is going to be amazing. I really thought this is going to be</p>
<p>horrible, but I&rsquo;ve got to do it. I cannot look myself in the mirror if I don&rsquo;t do it. So I did.</p>
<p>More to come next time.</p>
