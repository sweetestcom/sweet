    <p>The following is a conversation with Anika Harris,</p>
<p>author of Conscious,</p>
<p>a brief guide to the fundamental mystery of the mind.</p>
<p>And is someone who writes and thinks a lot</p>
<p>about the nature of consciousness and of reality,</p>
<p>especially from the perspectives</p>
<p>of physics and neuroscience.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Wealthfront for investing,</p>
<p>BetterHelp for mental health,</p>
<p>Blinkist for nonfiction,</p>
<p>Onnit for supplements and Indeed for hiring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Wealthfront,</p>
<p>savings and automated investing accounts</p>
<p>to help you build wealth and save for the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for good design.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that make me love Wealthfront</p>
<p>is that they have a beautifully designed</p>
<p>and streamlined interface for the investing process.</p>
<p>As a quick side note,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very loud lawnmower outside of where I&rsquo;m recording.</p>
<p>And that lawnmower is not only outside,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also inside my mind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s playing all kinds of games with my mind.</p>
<p>And I wonder if you hear it at all.</p>
<p>And I wonder if it&rsquo;s even real.</p>
<p>I just wanted to acknowledge the obvious</p>
<p>in case you do hear it.</p>
<p>And also acknowledge the obvious psychological complexity</p>
<p>of talking into a microphone while you&rsquo;re sitting alone</p>
<p>with all the world boiling up all around you</p>
<p>in this beautiful chaotic turmoil</p>
<p>that defines our reality.</p>
<p>Given that turmoil,</p>
<p>you may want to invest in your future.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Wealthfront is good at.</p>
<p>Nearly half a million people are using it.</p>
<p>I should mention in a faint attempt at expertise</p>
<p>that federal interest rates have been going up this year.</p>
<p>So the 2.55% API savings account</p>
<p>is quite an impressive feat,</p>
<p>which is exactly what Wealthfront offers.</p>
<p>You can check them out by going to wealthfront.com slash legs</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a $50 bonus with a $500 deposit.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by BetterHelp,</p>
<p>spelled H-E-L-P Help.</p>
<p>Speaking of the lawnmower that&rsquo;s outside of my house,</p>
<p>clearly the problem is not with the lawnmower.</p>
<p>The problem is with my mind.</p>
<p>And that problem can be solved through many methods.</p>
<p>But one of the most powerful is talk therapy.</p>
<p>And if you care to try that kind of thing,</p>
<p>you should make it super easy.</p>
<p>You should make it private, obviously,</p>
<p>and it should be affordable</p>
<p>and available to you wherever you are.</p>
<p>So it should be remote.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what BetterHelp offers,</p>
<p>an exploration of the demons that live inside your mind,</p>
<p>all of our minds, inside the shadow,</p>
<p>in the younging shadow of our mind.</p>
<p>You should explore them with a licensed professional</p>
<p>at BetterHelp, betterhelp.com slash legs.</p>
<p>And if you go there to that specific website slash legs,</p>
<p>you will save on your first month.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Blinkist,</p>
<p>my favorite app for learning new things.</p>
<p>Blinkist takes key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books</p>
<p>and condenses them down into 15 minutes</p>
<p>that you can read or listen to.</p>
<p>I am going on a run now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m doing a long 12 plus hour run.</p>
<p>On that run, I will be listening to a nonfiction book.</p>
<p>In fact, the book I will be listening to was picked by me</p>
<p>by first checking out the summary of that book on Blinkist.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not just a summary,</p>
<p>you know, like a Cliff Notes summary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a condensation of the key ideas,</p>
<p>which is fundamentally different to me than a shallow summary.</p>
<p>It somehow feels deep,</p>
<p>even though it takes a very short amount of time</p>
<p>to consume it.</p>
<p>Like I said, 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent way to choose a book</p>
<p>that you want to read in full.</p>
<p>First, get the key insights, read in full,</p>
<p>and again, return to the insights time and time again</p>
<p>to remind yourself to refresh the lessons</p>
<p>that you learned from the book when you first read it.</p>
<p>You can claim a special offer for savings</p>
<p>by going to blinkist.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Onnit,</p>
<p>which is a nutrition supplement and fitness company.</p>
<p>They make AlphaBrain, a nootropic</p>
<p>that helps support memory, mental speed, and focus.</p>
<p>Obviously, all of those things are things I care about</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m going through a difficult deep work session.</p>
<p>Deep work is something that one of the people</p>
<p>I really admire, a friend, Cal Newport, talks a lot about.</p>
<p>And these are sessions when you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>putting your mind to the test in terms of the focus,</p>
<p>in terms of the depth of the chain of thoughts,</p>
<p>unbroken, that you take yourself on.</p>
<p>And for me, that happens when I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>any kind of programming.</p>
<p>For me, that happens when I&rsquo;m doing design type of thinking,</p>
<p>so thinking through the early steps</p>
<p>of a programming project of how to solve</p>
<p>a particular problem.</p>
<p>And all of that just is very mentally</p>
<p>and intellectually straining.</p>
<p>And for that, your mind has to be in a really good place.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Annika Harris.</p>
<p>In your book, Conscious, you described evidence</p>
<p>that free will is an illusion</p>
<p>and that consciousness is used to construct this illusion</p>
<p>and convince ourselves that we are in fact</p>
<p>deciding our actions.</p>
<p>Can you explain this?</p>
<p>I think this is chapter three.</p>
<p>First of all, I really think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to make a distinction between free will and conscious will,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get into that in a moment.</p>
<p>So free will in terms of our brain as a system in nature,</p>
<p>making complex decisions</p>
<p>and doing all of the complex processing it does,</p>
<p>there is a decision-making process in nature</p>
<p>that our brains undergo that we can call free will.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine to use that shorthand for that.</p>
<p>Although once we get into the details,</p>
<p>I might convince you that it&rsquo;s not so free,</p>
<p>but the decision-making process is a process in nature.</p>
<p>The feeling, our conscious experience</p>
<p>of feeling like consciousness is the thing</p>
<p>that is driving the behavior,</p>
<p>that is, I would say in most cases, an illusion.</p>
<p>And usually when we talk about free will,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s in conjunction</p>
<p>with the decision-making process,</p>
<p>but for the most part, when we use the term free will,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about this feeling that consciousness,</p>
<p>that we have a self, that there&rsquo;s this concrete thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s separate from brain processing</p>
<p>that somehow swoops in and is the cause of our decision</p>
<p>or the cause of our next action.</p>
<p>And that is in large part,</p>
<p>if not in its entirety, an illusion.</p>
<p>So conscious will is an illusion</p>
<p>and then we can try to figure out.</p>
<p>Free will, I would say, is good shorthand</p>
<p>for a process in nature,</p>
<p>which is a decision-making process of the brain.</p>
<p>But decisions are still being made.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, if you ran the universe over again,</p>
<p>is there, would it turn out the same way?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe, I&rsquo;m trying to sneak up to like,</p>
<p>what does it mean to make a decision</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s almost, that means something?</p>
<p>So, right.</p>
<p>So this is where our intuitions get challenged.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about some new examples for this</p>
<p>just because I talk about it a lot.</p>
<p>And the truth is, most of the things I write about</p>
<p>and talk about and think about are so counterintuitive.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really what my game is,</p>
<p>is breaking intuitions, shaking up intuitions</p>
<p>in order to get a deeper understanding of reality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often, even though I&rsquo;ve thought about this for 20 years</p>
<p>and think about it all the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an obsession of mine, really.</p>
<p>I have to get back into that mind frame</p>
<p>to be able to think clearly about it</p>
<p>because it is so counterintuitive.</p>
<p>How long does that take?</p>
<p>How hard is that?</p>
<p>Depends on if there are kids around</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m alone or if I&rsquo;ve been meditating.</p>
<p>But what I was going to say, actually,</p>
<p>I felt like we needed to just take one step back</p>
<p>and talk a little bit,</p>
<p>just because I think the importance</p>
<p>of shaking up intuitions for scientific advancement</p>
<p>is such an important piece of the scientific process.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve reached a point in consciousness studies</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very difficult to move forward.</p>
<p>And usually that&rsquo;s a sign</p>
<p>that we need to start shaking up our intuitions.</p>
<p>So throughout history, the huge breakthroughs,</p>
<p>the things that have really shifted our view</p>
<p>of the universe and our place in the universe</p>
<p>and all of that, those almost always,</p>
<p>if not always, require that we, at the very least,</p>
<p>shift our intuitions, update our intuitions.</p>
<p>But many of them, we just have to let go of intuitions</p>
<p>that are feeding us false information</p>
<p>about the way the world works.</p>
<p>Well, the weirdest thing here is that</p>
<p>here we&rsquo;re looking at our own mind.</p>
<p>So you have to let go of your intuitions</p>
<p>about your own intuitions.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very meta and makes it hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s part of the reason why doing interviews for me</p>
<p>feels so difficult, aside from the fact</p>
<p>that I just have social anxiety in general.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>because I took mushrooms just before we started.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in this journey together.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So where do we take a step backwards to, Leslie?</p>
<p>I was going to say, I mean,</p>
<p>this leads into the point I was going to make,</p>
<p>but what I was going to say is,</p>
<p>I mean, also just for me,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m not as good at speaking as I am at writing,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m clearer in my writing.</p>
<p>And because these topics are so difficult</p>
<p>to get our minds around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to kind of get to any real conclusion in real time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually how I started writing my book,</p>
<p>was just writing for myself.</p>
<p>I decided that I needed to spend some time</p>
<p>writing down all of my thoughts</p>
<p>in order to get clear about how I think about them.</p>
<p>So you write down a sentence and you think,</p>
<p>in the silence, in the quiet.</p>
<p>Paragraphs.</p>
<p>Paragraphs, and you just.</p>
<p>And then I see if that makes sense.</p>
<p>And then I check it with my intuitions,</p>
<p>which is really the scientific process.</p>
<p>And I really, in many ways,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m a physicist at heart.</p>
<p>All of my inquiry, all of my career,</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m interested in,</p>
<p>actually going back to being a child,</p>
<p>is just deep curiosity about how the world works,</p>
<p>what this place is, what it&rsquo;s made of, how we got here.</p>
<p>Just being amazed at the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m having an experience over here</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having one over there,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in this moment of time.</p>
<p>And what does that all mean?</p>
<p>My interest in consciousness really came out</p>
<p>of originally an interest in physics.</p>
<p>And I guess that the two were always side by side,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t really connect them until I was older.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always been really interested</p>
<p>in just understanding the nature of reality</p>
<p>before I even had language to describe it.</p>
<p>You talked about sort of laying down</p>
<p>and looking up at the stars,</p>
<p>sort of trying to let go of the intuition</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a ground below us,</p>
<p>which is a really interesting exercise.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many exercises of this sort you can do,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a really good one.</p>
<p>Well, and I think scientists and children</p>
<p>who will become scientists</p>
<p>or just kind of scientists at heart</p>
<p>really enjoy that feeling</p>
<p>of breaking through their intuitions.</p>
<p>And I remember the first time it happened, actually,</p>
<p>I was playing with marbles.</p>
<p>And marbles have all these different shapes.</p>
<p>Each one is unique, and they&rsquo;re all the,</p>
<p>it looks like there&rsquo;s liquid inside them.</p>
<p>And I remember asking my father</p>
<p>how they got the liquid inside the glass ball.</p>
<p>And he said, actually, it&rsquo;s solid all the way through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all glass.</p>
<p>And I had such a hard time imagining,</p>
<p>it just didn&rsquo;t seem right to me.</p>
<p>I was very young when I,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a complicated person,</p>
<p>but he was wonderful in this way</p>
<p>in that he would kind of entertain my curiosity.</p>
<p>And so he said, let&rsquo;s open them up.</p>
<p>And he got a towel,</p>
<p>and we put the marbles on the towel and got a hammer,</p>
<p>and he smashed them all.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, it was all glass.</p>
<p>And I remember,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the first time I had that feeling</p>
<p>of realizing, wow, the truth was so different</p>
<p>from what I expected.</p>
<p>And I like that feeling.</p>
<p>And of course, we need to be able to do that</p>
<p>to understand that the Earth is flat,</p>
<p>to understand the germ theory of disease,</p>
<p>to understand long processes in nature like evolution.</p>
<p>I mean, we just can never really intuit</p>
<p>that we share genes with ants.</p>
<p>Did you just say the Earth is flat?</p>
<p>You mean the Earth is not flat.</p>
<p>Did I say that?</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>But I actually like to think about-</p>
<p>Exactly, see, this is why I need to write and not speak.</p>
<p>Well, I actually really like conspiracy theories and so on.</p>
<p>I really like flat Earth,</p>
<p>people that believe the Earth is flat,</p>
<p>or not believe, but argue for the Earth is flat.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because you can see,</p>
<p>I mean, the intuition is so strong.</p>
<p>I just said it.</p>
<p>The thing I love about folks who argue for flat Earth</p>
<p>is they are thinking deeply.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re questioning, actually,</p>
<p>what has now become intuition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become the mainstream narrative</p>
<p>that the Earth is round,</p>
<p>where people actually don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>yeah, don&rsquo;t think, actually,</p>
<p>how crazy it is that the Earth is round.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a ball.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking out at the space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really humbling,</p>
<p>because I think the basic intuition,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re walking on the ground,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an underlying belief</p>
<p>that Earth is the center of the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of feeling</p>
<p>like this is the only world that exists.</p>
<p>And you kind of know that there&rsquo;s a huge universe out there,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really load that information in.</p>
<p>And I think flat Earthers are really contending</p>
<p>with those big ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, and I think, I mean,</p>
<p>the truth is that when those observations were first made,</p>
<p>when the celestial observations were made</p>
<p>that revealed this fact to us,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember how long it took,</p>
<p>but I think it was close to 100 years</p>
<p>before it was actually accepted as common knowledge</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re no longer the center of the universe,</p>
<p>or, of course, we never were.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true almost every time</p>
<p>we have a breakthrough like that</p>
<p>that challenges our intuitions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually a period of time where we have to,</p>
<p>and this is an important part of the process,</p>
<p>because often our intuitions give us good information.</p>
<p>And so when the science goes against,</p>
<p>when our scientific observations go against our intuitions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for us to let that in</p>
<p>and to see which side is gonna win.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s clear that the evidence is winning,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s this period of time</p>
<p>where we have to grapple with our intuitions</p>
<p>and shift the way we frame our worldview</p>
<p>and go through that process.</p>
<p>But free will.</p>
<p>Free will&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>So here we are, still in consciousness studies,</p>
<p>pretty stuck, at least in terms of the neuroscience.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I started thinking more deeply about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a lot of scientists right now</p>
<p>are actually interested in studying consciousness,</p>
<p>where it was very taboo before.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re at this really interesting turning point,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s wonderful,</p>
<p>but it will require that we shake up our intuitions a bit</p>
<p>and reframe some things</p>
<p>and look at what the neuroscience is telling us.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of questions.</p>
<p>We have more questions than answers.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I think if we&rsquo;re going to make progress</p>
<p>in consciousness studies,</p>
<p>we need to start really looking at the illusions</p>
<p>and false intuitions that are getting in our way.</p>
<p>Do you think studying the brain can give us clues</p>
<p>about free will, like some of these questions?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think it already has.</p>
<p>And I think many facts that have come out of neuroscience</p>
<p>are still barely seeping into the culture.</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is going to be a long process.</p>
<p>So part of my work is really just looking at areas</p>
<p>where we already know some of our intuitions are wrong</p>
<p>and starting to accept them and starting to let them in</p>
<p>and starting to ask questions about,</p>
<p>well, what does this mean then</p>
<p>about the nature of consciousness?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to actually get at this question</p>
<p>of free will and conscious will.</p>
<p>I have, my intuitions here are, I mean, I&rsquo;m a human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, I mean, I approach it from two aspects.</p>
<p>One is a human being, and two, from a robotics perspective.</p>
<p>And I wonder how big the gap between the two is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a useful, from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>is another perspective that&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>and helpful to take on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are we really so different, you and I,</p>
<p>the robot and the human?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to believe so,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t exactly see where the difference is.</p>
<p>Research into AI and just the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s entered our consciousness</p>
<p>at the level of stories and film</p>
<p>and all of these questions that it&rsquo;s raising</p>
<p>is facing us with that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like the zombie experiment</p>
<p>is coming to life for us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more and more looking at human-like systems</p>
<p>and wondering, is there an experience in there</p>
<p>and how can we figure that out?</p>
<p>When you were talking about your experience</p>
<p>of looking at robots, it reminds me of how I,</p>
<p>for many years, have been looking at plants.</p>
<p>Because the plant behavior,</p>
<p>and actually, this is the example.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll just try it out.</p>
<p>It may not work.</p>
<p>This is an example I was thinking of recently</p>
<p>because I was reading back on the work of Mark Jaffe,</p>
<p>who did this research with pea tendrils.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he did many other plant studies,</p>
<p>but this is the one I was reading about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hoping this analogy, I&rsquo;ll just set it up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that this analogy will be something</p>
<p>that we can keep coming back to as we move forward</p>
<p>because as we shake up our intuitions and get confused</p>
<p>and then we come back to our intuitions</p>
<p>and say, no, that just can&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>I think this analogy might be helpful.</p>
<p>What kind of plant was he working on?</p>
<p>Pea tendrils, so a pea plant has these tendrils.</p>
<p>You can picture them, they coil.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know what year this research was done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing in the 80s, but some.</p>
<p>But pea tendrils have been around long before that.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, and the research may have happened</p>
<p>long before the 80s.</p>
<p>In fact, they might be doing the research on the humans,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So, pea tendrils, as a system,</p>
<p>generally, there are a few more things they can do,</p>
<p>but generally they can behave in two ways.</p>
<p>They can grow in a straight line slowly,</p>
<p>or they can grow in this coil form more quickly.</p>
<p>And what happens is when they are growing</p>
<p>in a straight manner and they encounter a branch</p>
<p>or a pole or something else that it can wrap itself around</p>
<p>to gain more stability, when it senses a branch there,</p>
<p>that gives it the cue to start growing at a more rapid pace</p>
<p>and to start coiling instead of growing straight.</p>
<p>So, it has these two behaviors.</p>
<p>As a system, it&rsquo;s capable of growing straight</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s capable of coiling.</p>
<p>One interesting thing, actually, I&rsquo;ll just add this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not totally relevant,</p>
<p>but one interesting thing is Mark Jaffe&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>So, he cut a pea tendril.</p>
<p>He was curious to see if it could do this on its own,</p>
<p>separate from the rest of the plant.</p>
<p>So, he cut a pea tendril off the plant.</p>
<p>If you keep it in a moist, warm environment,</p>
<p>it will continue to behave in these ways.</p>
<p>So, it will continue to coil.</p>
<p>He noticed that if he touched one end of it,</p>
<p>if he rubbed one side of it, that gave it enough of a cue</p>
<p>that it would start to coil.</p>
<p>And then he noticed that it needed light</p>
<p>to perform this action.</p>
<p>So, in the dark, when he rubbed the edge of the tendril,</p>
<p>it did not coil.</p>
<p>In the light, it would.</p>
<p>And then he recognized this further fact,</p>
<p>which was that the pea tendril that he rubbed in the dark,</p>
<p>that was still straight,</p>
<p>if he brought it out into the light,</p>
<p>and this could be hours later, it would start to coil.</p>
<p>It has a primitive form of memory</p>
<p>where it has the sensation</p>
<p>and then it holds onto that information.</p>
<p>And as soon as there&rsquo;s light, it acts on that information.</p>
<p>But also in a kind of distributed intelligence,</p>
<p>because you can separate it from the main part.</p>
<p>Like if you chop off a human arm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna keep growing.</p>
<p>Even if you keep it in a moist, warm environment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna reach out for the cup of coffee</p>
<p>when you come in with Starbucks.</p>
<p>Maybe in the correct environment.</p>
<p>Maybe we just haven&rsquo;t found the environment.</p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a separate fact.</p>
<p>But anyway, so if you just use the analogy of a pea tendril,</p>
<p>and if you imagine, which is something I like to do a lot,</p>
<p>if you imagine this plant</p>
<p>has some kind of conscious experience,</p>
<p>of course it doesn&rsquo;t have complex thought,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have anything like a human experience,</p>
<p>but if it were possible for a plant</p>
<p>to have some felt experience,</p>
<p>you can imagine that when it comes into contact</p>
<p>with a branch and starts to coil,</p>
<p>that that feeling could be one of deciding to do that,</p>
<p>or that it feels good to do that, or kind of wanting.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s too complex, that&rsquo;s anthropomorphizing,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a way in which you could imagine</p>
<p>this pea tendril, under those circumstances,</p>
<p>suddenly wants to start coiling.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re saying you try to meditate</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;s like to be a pea tendril, a plant.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s required here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have to empathize with a plant,</p>
<p>or with another organism that&rsquo;s not human.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you don&rsquo;t actually need that for this analogy,</p>
<p>the larger analogy that I&rsquo;m getting at,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s an interesting piece to keep in mind,</p>
<p>that you could imagine that, in nature,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a conscious experience</p>
<p>associated with a pea tendril,</p>
<p>that at that moment, what that feels like</p>
<p>is a want to start moving in a different way.</p>
<p>So, you wanna imagine that without anthropomorphizing,</p>
<p>so without projecting the human experience,</p>
<p>but rather sort of humbling yourself</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just another plant with more complexity.</p>
<p>Yes, in a way.</p>
<p>Like, trying to see where-</p>
<p>Exactly, so that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going with this.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And when you start making that connection,</p>
<p>you can see where there are a few points</p>
<p>at which there&rsquo;s room for an illusion to come in,</p>
<p>for our own feelings of will.</p>
<p>So, when we move from a pea tendril</p>
<p>to human decision-making,</p>
<p>obviously, human decision-making,</p>
<p>human brains are many, many, many times more complex</p>
<p>than whatever&rsquo;s going on in a pea tendril.</p>
<p>I mean, the brain is actually the most complex thing</p>
<p>we know of in the universe thus far.</p>
<p>So, there is the genes that help develop the brain</p>
<p>into any particular brain into what it is.</p>
<p>There are all the inputs.</p>
<p>There are countless factors that we could never,</p>
<p>I mean, it may as well be an infinite number of factors.</p>
<p>And then in that particular moment,</p>
<p>whatever the inputs are to a brain,</p>
<p>the brain is capable of almost an infinite number</p>
<p>of outputs, right?</p>
<p>So, if I walked in here this morning and you said,</p>
<p>would you like water or tea?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a simple decision for me to make.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a passive-aggressive way of telling me</p>
<p>I should have offered you some tea.</p>
<p>But yes, go on.</p>
<p>No, I wanted water.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>I actually asked for water.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, great.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t have any free will anyway,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hold you responsible for any of it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I was just running an algorithm deterministically.</p>
<p>You give me this decision, right, to make water or tea.</p>
<p>Go back to the pea tendril for a second.</p>
<p>The pea tendril is capable of growing</p>
<p>in a straight line slowly or in a coil quickly.</p>
<p>My brain is capable of all kinds of responses</p>
<p>to that question, even though you&rsquo;ve given me two options.</p>
<p>You could offer me water or tea,</p>
<p>and I could just run out of the room screaming</p>
<p>if I wanted to, right?</p>
<p>It happens to me all the time with dates.</p>
<p>Never mind, I don&rsquo;t wanna do this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The fact that the brain is capable,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s so many inputs,</p>
<p>and then the brain is capable of so many outputs,</p>
<p>as a system, what it&rsquo;s hard for us to get our minds around</p>
<p>is that it may not be capable of any behavior</p>
<p>in every moment in time.</p>
<p>So as a system, it&rsquo;s capable of doing all kinds of things.</p>
<p>And the point I&rsquo;m making is that</p>
<p>if we could see all of the factors</p>
<p>leading up to the moment where I chose water</p>
<p>or where I ran screaming from the room,</p>
<p>we could, in fact, see that there was no other behavior</p>
<p>I was going to or could have exhibited in that moment,</p>
<p>in the same way that when the P tendril hits the branch,</p>
<p>it starts coiling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a parallel, which is very interesting in robotics,</p>
<p>with fish and water.</p>
<p>So you could see, they&rsquo;ve experienced with dead fish,</p>
<p>and they keep swimming.</p>
<p>So the fish is capable of all kinds of complicated movements</p>
<p>as a system, but in any one moment,</p>
<p>the river, the full complexity of the river</p>
<p>defines the actual movement of the fish.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sufficient.</p>
<p>Well, and I should also, I mean,</p>
<p>this brings up another point,</p>
<p>which is that there is a difference</p>
<p>between voluntary and involuntary behavior.</p>
<p>So of course, we have reflexes,</p>
<p>and it is a different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different brain processing in action</p>
<p>when I make a decision about water or tea</p>
<p>than there is if my behavior is forced from the outside,</p>
<p>or if I have a brain tumor that&rsquo;s causing me</p>
<p>to make certain decisions or feel certain feelings.</p>
<p>And so the point is that at bottom,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all brain processing and behavior,</p>
<p>but the reason why certain actions feel will,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good reason why it feels that way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s to distinguish our own self-generated behavior</p>
<p>based on thinking and possibly weighing</p>
<p>the different results of different things.</p>
<p>I already had caffeine today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want more.</p>
<p>There are all these processes,</p>
<p>things that we can point to and things that we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>things I&rsquo;m affected by at a subconscious level.</p>
<p>And that is very different from an unwilled action</p>
<p>or reflex or something like that.</p>
<p>And so some people, I can imagine,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used the pee tendril example,</p>
<p>but I can imagine they wouldn&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>because the pee tendril sounds more to them like a reflex,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t address the question</p>
<p>of a much more complex decision-making process.</p>
<p>But I think at bottom, that is what it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really where the illusion of free will</p>
<p>and the illusion of self,</p>
<p>which I think is they&rsquo;re kind of two sides</p>
<p>of the same coin, come from.</p>
<p>So even when we intellectually understand</p>
<p>that everything we&rsquo;re feeling, everything we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is based on our brain processing and brain behavior,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a physicalist, you&rsquo;ve bought into that.</p>
<p>Even when you intellectually understand that,</p>
<p>we, and I include myself in this,</p>
<p>we still have this feeling that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that stands outside of the brain processing</p>
<p>that can intervene.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the illusion.</p>
<p>I was tweeting with someone recently,</p>
<p>which I almost never do, but we&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>in the TED documentary that I&rsquo;m making right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working on the episode on free will.</p>
<p>So I was allowing myself to go back and forth</p>
<p>in a way that I don&rsquo;t usually on Twitter.</p>
<p>Like arguing?</p>
<p>About free will.</p>
<p>It was a friendly debate.</p>
<p>Gonna go into the reasons why I&rsquo;m not crazy about Twitter,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s leave that for another time.</p>
<p>I mean, talk about how hard it is to have this conversation</p>
<p>when we have as many hours as we like,</p>
<p>trying to do it in soundbites over Twitter.</p>
<p>See, I like how you made the decision now</p>
<p>not to talk about Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a road less traveled.</p>
<p>That was one of the things I said to this person was,</p>
<p>because someone chimed in and said,</p>
<p>you said I, what do you mean by I?</p>
<p>And so, actually that&rsquo;s another point I could make,</p>
<p>which is, first, my response to that was,</p>
<p>well, people tend to get creeped out when I say</p>
<p>the system that is my brain and body</p>
<p>that we call Annika recommends.</p>
<p>Why do you get freaked out?</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like in your personal life?</p>
<p>Oh, instead of I.</p>
<p>Instead of like never saying I, yeah.</p>
<p>Always, you know, but I always referred to you</p>
<p>as the brain and body we call Lex.</p>
<p>Yes, well, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s kind of charming in a way.</p>
<p>Alleged brain.</p>
<p>So, I and you are very useful shorthand,</p>
<p>even though at some level they&rsquo;re illusions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very useful shorthand for the system of my brain,</p>
<p>really, and my body, the whole system.</p>
<p>That I is useful for that, but the illusion is when</p>
<p>we feel like there&rsquo;s something outside of that system</p>
<p>that can intervene, that is free,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somehow free from the physical world.</p>
<p>I can have the thought,</p>
<p>yeah, I&rsquo;m really not crazy about having intellectual</p>
<p>back and forth on Twitter, and then feel like I decide</p>
<p>to not follow that thought, right?</p>
<p>And the feeling, that&rsquo;s the feeling</p>
<p>where the illusion comes in, because it really feels</p>
<p>as if, sure, my brain had that original thought,</p>
<p>and then I came in and made a different decision.</p>
<p>But of course, the truth is, it was just further</p>
<p>brain processing that got me to decide</p>
<p>not to go down that path.</p>
<p>How much is that feeling of conscious will</p>
<p>is culturally constructed shorthand?</p>
<p>So, I and you is, you could say,</p>
<p>a culturally constructed shorthand.</p>
<p>How much of that affects how we think?</p>
<p>So, our parents say I and you, I and you,</p>
<p>and then we start to believe in I and you,</p>
<p>or is that fundamental to the human brain machine that we?</p>
<p>I think it goes very deep, I think it&rsquo;s fundamental,</p>
<p>and I think it probably, some form of feeling like a self</p>
<p>goes as deep as cats and dogs, and it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I mean, if consciousness does go down to the level of cells,</p>
<p>or however far down you wanna take it, worms,</p>
<p>or I think any system that&rsquo;s navigating itself</p>
<p>that kind of has boundaries</p>
<p>and is navigating itself in the world,</p>
<p>my guess is that it&rsquo;s an intrinsic part of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I imagined that the pee tendril</p>
<p>would have this feeling.</p>
<p>And so, we use the word I,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, first of all,</p>
<p>that the way we talk about things</p>
<p>affects our intuitions about them</p>
<p>and how we feel about them,</p>
<p>and so there are other cultures who are more open</p>
<p>to breaking through these illusions than others, for sure,</p>
<p>just because of their belief sets, the way they talk.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;m not a linguist,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even speak a second language,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t speak to it, but if there were a language</p>
<p>that framed who we are differently in everyday language,</p>
<p>I mean, in our everyday communication,</p>
<p>I would think that would have an effect.</p>
<p>Yeah, language does affect things,</p>
<p>and I mean, just knowing Russian</p>
<p>and the history of the Soviet Union in the 20th century,</p>
<p>obviously, it lived under communism for a long time,</p>
<p>so your conception of individualism is different,</p>
<p>and that reflects itself in the language.</p>
<p>You could probably have a similar kind of thing</p>
<p>within the language in terms of how we talk about I</p>
<p>and we and so on, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>certain countries or maybe even villages</p>
<p>with certain dialects that let go of the individualism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inherent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there must be a range,</p>
<p>but I do think that it&rsquo;s pretty deep,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s also a difference</p>
<p>between the autobiographical me</p>
<p>and then this more fundamental me that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>or that I&rsquo;m pointing to as the illusion,</p>
<p>so in my book, I talk about if someone wakes up with amnesia</p>
<p>if they have brain injury and suddenly have amnesia</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t remember anything about their lives,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t remember their name,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recognize people they&rsquo;re related to,</p>
<p>they would have lost their autobiographical self,</p>
<p>but they would still feel like an I.</p>
<p>They would still have that basic sense of I&rsquo;m a person.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;d be speaking that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember my name.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where I live.</p>
<p>You still, it goes very deep, this feeling</p>
<p>that I am a single entity that is somehow</p>
<p>not completely reliant upon the cause and effect</p>
<p>of the physical world.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a pothead question?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you, would you rather lose all your memories</p>
<p>or not be able to make new ones?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m asking you as a human</p>
<p>in terms of happiness and preference.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t answer that.</p>
<p>You like both?</p>
<p>You like both features of the organism that you embody?</p>
<p>Well, one is intellectual and one is psychological, really.</p>
<p>I mean, I would have to choose the memories</p>
<p>only because, I mean, the memories of the past,</p>
<p>only because I have children and a family</p>
<p>and it would just be, it wouldn&rsquo;t just be affecting me,</p>
<p>it would be affecting them.</p>
<p>It would just be too horrible.</p>
<p>No, but you would make new ones, right?</p>
<p>If I lost my memory of the 13 past 13 years</p>
<p>of my life?</p>
<p>You think you would lose, this is a dark question.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, wasn&rsquo;t that the question?</p>
<p>Maybe I misunderstood.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, you understood it perfectly,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t, sorry for the dark question,</p>
<p>but the people you love in your life,</p>
<p>if you lost all your memory of everything,</p>
<p>do you think you would still love them?</p>
<p>Like you show up, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a roll of the dice.</p>
<p>I mean, not in the way that I do.</p>
<p>Right, so some deep aspect of love</p>
<p>is the history you have together.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, and this gets to an interesting point, actually,</p>
<p>which I think a lot about, which is memory.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t go into this yet,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just plant a flag here that memory is,</p>
<p>yeah, memory is obviously related to time,</p>
<p>and time is something that I&rsquo;m fascinated with.</p>
<p>And for this project I&rsquo;m working on now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mostly been speaking to physicists</p>
<p>who are interested in consciousness.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s partly because of this link</p>
<p>between memory and time,</p>
<p>and all of these new fascinating theories</p>
<p>and thoughts around the different interpretations</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics, and looking at,</p>
<p>the thing that I&rsquo;ve always been looking for</p>
<p>is really the fundamental nature of reality,</p>
<p>and why my questions about consciousness</p>
<p>lead me to wonder if consciousness</p>
<p>is a more fundamental aspect of the universe</p>
<p>than we previously thought,</p>
<p>and certainly I previously thought.</p>
<p>And so memory, but memory is tied to so many things.</p>
<p>I mean, even basic functions in nature,</p>
<p>actually, so the P-tendril, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>memory comes into play there, and that&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>And there is no sense of self without memory,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re starting from scratch,</p>
<p>as you said, with amnesia.</p>
<p>If you truly couldn&rsquo;t lay down any new memories,</p>
<p>I think you would, then that sense of self</p>
<p>would begin to disintegrate,</p>
<p>because the sense of self is one of a concrete entity</p>
<p>through time, and if each moment,</p>
<p>if you really were stuck in the present moment,</p>
<p>eternally, you&rsquo;d basically be meditating.</p>
<p>And in meditation, this is a very common experience,</p>
<p>is losing that sense of self, that sense of free will,</p>
<p>that those illusions more easily drop away in meditation,</p>
<p>and I would say for most people who meditate long enough,</p>
<p>they do drop away, and there&rsquo;s actually an explanation</p>
<p>at the level of the brain as well.</p>
<p>The default mode network is circuitry in the brain</p>
<p>that neuroscientists don&rsquo;t completely understand,</p>
<p>but know is largely responsible</p>
<p>for this feeling of being a self,</p>
<p>and when that circuit gets quieted down,</p>
<p>which it does in meditation,</p>
<p>and also does with the use of psychedelic drugs,</p>
<p>and there are other ways to quiet down</p>
<p>the default mode network,</p>
<p>people have this experience of losing this illusion</p>
<p>of being a self.</p>
<p>They no longer feel that they&rsquo;re a self</p>
<p>in the way that they usually do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the autobiographical self</p>
<p>is connected to the sense of self.</p>
<p>Through the memory, and then you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>that the solution to that lies in physics,</p>
<p>not just neuroscience.</p>
<p>Like ultimately consciousness and the experience,</p>
<p>the conscious will, is a question of physics.</p>
<p>I may have said something misleading</p>
<p>because I was connecting too many dots.</p>
<p>Half the things I say are misleading.</p>
<p>Let us mislead each other.</p>
<p>I just got, I got excited when memory came up</p>
<p>because I love talking about time.</p>
<p>So you mentioned a project you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>a couple of times.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>I think you said Ted is involved.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re interviewing a bunch of people.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the topic?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m working on an audio documentary about consciousness,</p>
<p>and it picks up where my book left off.</p>
<p>So all of the questions that were still lingering for me,</p>
<p>and research that I still wanted to do,</p>
<p>I just started conducting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done about 30 interviews so far,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not totally clear what the end result will be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently collaborating with Ted,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun creating a pilot with them.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll see where it goes,</p>
<p>but the idea is that it&rsquo;s a narrated documentary.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a series.</p>
<p>A series, it&rsquo;ll be a 10-part series.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unclear, oh, you already know the number of parts?</p>
<p>Sorry, in my mind, it&rsquo;s a 10-part series.</p>
<p>It may end up being eight, or 11, or 12.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Listen, I am very comforted by the numbers zero and one</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>About 10.</p>
<p>I like the confidence of 10.</p>
<p>So, and you&rsquo;re not sure what the title,</p>
<p>like not the title, but the topic.</p>
<p>Will there be consciousness, or something bigger,</p>
<p>or something smaller?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s my, so at the end of my book,</p>
<p>I kind of get to the place where I&rsquo;ve convinced myself,</p>
<p>at least, that this question about whether consciousness</p>
<p>is fundamental is a legitimate one.</p>
<p>And then I just start spending a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about what that would mean,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s even possible to study scientifically.</p>
<p>So I mostly talk to physicists, actually,</p>
<p>because I really think, ultimately,</p>
<p>this is a question for physics,</p>
<p>if consciousness is fundamental.</p>
<p>I think it needs to be strongly informed by neuroscience,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, yeah, if it&rsquo;s part of the fabric of reality,</p>
<p>it is a question for a physicist.</p>
<p>So I speak to different physicists</p>
<p>about different interpretations of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>so getting at the fundamentals.</p>
<p>So string theory and many worlds,</p>
<p>I spoke to Sean Carroll,</p>
<p>had a great conversation with Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so generous, because he clearly doesn&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with me about many things.</p>
<p>But he has a curious mind,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s willing to have these conversations.</p>
<p>And I was really interested</p>
<p>in understanding many worlds better,</p>
<p>and if consciousness is fundamental,</p>
<p>what the implications are.</p>
<p>So that was where I started, actually,</p>
<p>was with many worlds.</p>
<p>And then we had conversations about string theory</p>
<p>and the holographic principle.</p>
<p>I spoke to Lee Smolin and Brian Green and Jan Eleven</p>
<p>and Carlo Rovelli, actually.</p>
<p>Have you had Carlo on?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s great, also, and fun to talk to,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s just endlessly curious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing audio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all audio, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in the format of a documentary,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m narrating it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of telling the story</p>
<p>of what questions came up for me,</p>
<p>what I was interested in exploring,</p>
<p>and then why I talk to each person I talk to.</p>
<p>By the way, I highly recommend Sean Carroll&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Mindscape podcast, I think it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things,</p>
<p>when he interviews physicists, it&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>but any topic, his aim is.</p>
<p>But one of my favorite things</p>
<p>is how frustrated he gets with panpsychism.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s still like, it&rsquo;s like a fly towards the light.</p>
<p>For some reason, he can&rsquo;t make sense of it,</p>
<p>but he still struggles with it,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s the sign of a good scientist,</p>
<p>who is struggling with these ideas.</p>
<p>I totally agree, and yes, that&rsquo;s what I appreciate in him,</p>
<p>and many scientists like that.</p>
<p>Who has the craziest, most radical ideas</p>
<p>that you talk with currently?</p>
<p>So you can go either direction.</p>
<p>You can go like, panpsychism,</p>
<p>consciousness permeates everything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far you can go down that direction.</p>
<p>Or you could say that,</p>
<p>what would be the other direction?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>Well, there isn&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>The problem is they&rsquo;re all crazy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all crazy.</p>
<p>Each one is crazier than the next.</p>
<p>All of us are crazy.</p>
<p>And my own, I mean, my own thoughts.</p>
<p>Now, I have to be very careful about the words I choose,</p>
<p>because, I mean, it&rsquo;s just like talking</p>
<p>about the different interpretations of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Once you get deep enough, it&rsquo;s so counterintuitive,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so beyond anything we understand,</p>
<p>that they all sound crazy.</p>
<p>Many worlds sounds crazy.</p>
<p>String theory, I mean, these are things</p>
<p>we just cannot get our minds around, really.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the realm I love to live in,</p>
<p>and love to explore in.</p>
<p>And the realm that, to my surprise,</p>
<p>my interest in consciousness has taken me back to.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question on that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just a side tangent.</p>
<p>How do you prevent, when you&rsquo;re imagining yourself</p>
<p>to be a petandro, how do you prevent from going crazy?</p>
<p>I mean, this is kind of the Nietzsche question</p>
<p>of like, you have to be very careful</p>
<p>thinking outside the norms of society,</p>
<p>because you might fall off.</p>
<p>Like mentally, you&rsquo;re so connected as a human</p>
<p>to the collective intelligence,</p>
<p>that in order to question intuitions,</p>
<p>you have to step outside of it for a brief moment.</p>
<p>How do you prevent yourself from going crazy?</p>
<p>I think I used to think that was a concern.</p>
<p>And then you became crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned so much about the brain.</p>
<p>No, and I&rsquo;ve had experiences of deep depression,</p>
<p>and I struggled with anxiety my whole life.</p>
<p>I think in order to be a good scientist,</p>
<p>and in order to be a truthfully, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>to allow yourself to be curious and honest</p>
<p>in your curiosity, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable</p>
<p>that lots of ideas and theories and hypotheses</p>
<p>will just sound crazy.</p>
<p>And that is always how we&rsquo;ve advanced science.</p>
<p>And maybe, you know, nine out of 10 ideas are crazy,</p>
<p>and crazy meaning they&rsquo;re actually not correct.</p>
<p>But all of, I mean, it&rsquo;s, as I said,</p>
<p>all of the big scientific breakthroughs,</p>
<p>all of the truths we&rsquo;ve uncovered</p>
<p>that are the earth-shattering truths that we uncover,</p>
<p>they really do sound crazy at first.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think one necessarily leads</p>
<p>to a type of mental illness.</p>
<p>I see mental illness in a very different category.</p>
<p>And I think some people are more susceptible</p>
<p>to being destabilized by this type of thinking.</p>
<p>And that might be a legitimate concern for some people,</p>
<p>that kind of being grounded in everyday life</p>
<p>is important for my psychological health.</p>
<p>The more time I spend thinking about the bigger picture</p>
<p>and outside of everyday life,</p>
<p>the more happy I am, the more expansive I feel.</p>
<p>I mean, it feels nourishing to me.</p>
<p>It feels like it makes me more sane, not less.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a happiness.</p>
<p>But in terms of your ability to see the truth,</p>
<p>you can be happy and completely.</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t see mental illness</p>
<p>necessarily being linked to truth or not truth.</p>
<p>So we were talking about minimizing mental illness.</p>
<p>But also, truth is a different dimension.</p>
<p>So you have to, you can go crazy in both directions.</p>
<p>You can be extremely happy, and they are.</p>
<p>Flat earthers, you can believe the earth is flat.</p>
<p>Because, actually, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s good books on this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s somehow really comforting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun and comforting to believe you&rsquo;ve figured out</p>
<p>the thing that everybody else hasn&rsquo;t figured out.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what conspiracy theories</p>
<p>always provide people.</p>
<p>Why is it so fun?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>Except when it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>But even then, it&rsquo;s probably fun.</p>
<p>But then you shouldn&rsquo;t do it, because it&rsquo;s unethical.</p>
<p>Anyway, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of following.</p>
<p>Well, that makes one of us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There is probably a fascinating story</p>
<p>to why conspiracy theories are so compelling</p>
<p>to us human beings, as deeper than just fun internet stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very interested</p>
<p>in why they&rsquo;re so compelling to some people and not others.</p>
<p>I feel like there must be some difference</p>
<p>that at some point we&rsquo;ll be able to discover.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because some people are just not susceptible to them,</p>
<p>and some people are really drawn to them.</p>
<p>Because I feel like the kind of thinking</p>
<p>that allows for you to be open to conspiracy theories</p>
<p>is also the kind of thinking that leads</p>
<p>to brilliant breakthroughs in science.</p>
<p>Sort of willingness to go to crazy land.</p>
<p>Something that seems like crazy land.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I see it the opposite way.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, you don&rsquo;t see the connection</p>
<p>between thinking the Earth is flat</p>
<p>and coming up with special relativity.</p>
<p>Thinking the Earth is flat is following your intuitions</p>
<p>and not being open to counterintuitive ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very closed way of viewing things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way you feel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s information that tells us</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something else going on.</p>
<p>And that type of person will say,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s the way it feels to me.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>But wait a minute.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mainstream narrative of science</p>
<p>that says the Earth is round.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think a flat Earth,</p>
<p>see, I admire the very first step of a flat Earth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t admire the full journey.</p>
<p>But the first step is-</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re open to evidence,</p>
<p>then the evidence clearly takes you in one direction.</p>
<p>Right, but you have to ask the question.</p>
<p>You have to ask, to me,</p>
<p>this is like first principles thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The Earth looks flat.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna look around here.</p>
<p>How crazy is it that the Earth is round</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a thing called gravity</p>
<p>that operates between objects</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to the mass of the object?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Yes, the truth is often crazier</p>
<p>than what the situation feels to be.</p>
<p>A good step is to question what everyone is saying.</p>
<p>And then you learn a little bit.</p>
<p>I know what you mean.</p>
<p>To be skeptical about the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the authority factor.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think that,</p>
<p>and the authority in not in some kind of weird current</p>
<p>where everyone questions institutions,</p>
<p>but more like the authority of the senior scientists.</p>
<p>The junior scientists coming up,</p>
<p>wait a minute.</p>
<p>Why have we been doing things this way?</p>
<p>And at that first step,</p>
<p>I feel like that rebelliousness</p>
<p>or that open-mindedness</p>
<p>or maybe like resistance to,</p>
<p>maybe curiosity that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that is not affected</p>
<p>by whatever the mainstream science says of today.</p>
<p>Cass, I feel like mainstream science</p>
<p>has never been mainstream</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always a struggle for science to become mainstream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the reason why I started doing the work</p>
<p>of being open-minded and actually helping scientists</p>
<p>make their work more accessible</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s usually not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s advice for scientists.</p>
<p>Be more interesting and much more important,</p>
<p>be less arrogant.</p>
<p>So arrogance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little money in science.</p>
<p>And so everyone is fighting for that money</p>
<p>and they become more and more arrogant and siloed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I will say that the scientists I know,</p>
<p>and some of them are very well-known,</p>
<p>very famous scientists,</p>
<p>are the least arrogant people I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>That scientists in general,</p>
<p>their personalities are more open,</p>
<p>more humble,</p>
<p>more likely to say they just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been involved a lot in the science writing</p>
<p>and how the media portrays.</p>
<p>So one of scientists,</p>
<p>the scientific community&rsquo;s greatest frustration</p>
<p>is how their work gets presented in the media.</p>
<p>And a lot of the time,</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s the main frustration</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s some new breakthrough,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>And the scientists will be saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take five years.</p>
<p>And no one likes to write a story about something</p>
<p>that may or may not be true.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna take five years testing it.</p>
<p>And so the headline will be,</p>
<p>neuroscientists discovered they want this sensational.</p>
<p>And so I think the public often gets the false impression</p>
<p>that the scientists are arrogant.</p>
<p>And I really don&rsquo;t find that to be the case.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve worked with all kinds of people,</p>
<p>artists and my life path has taken a strange.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve met some incredible people.</p>
<p>You work with some incredible people.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, the crazy topic of free will.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, we have to link on this</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the plant, all right, can you try to steel man the case</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something really special about humans?</p>
<p>That there is a fundamental difference</p>
<p>between us and the petandral?</p>
<p>You know, humans are clearly very special</p>
<p>in the evolution of organisms on Earth.</p>
<p>Could that have been the magic leap?</p>
<p>Could consciousness been like the invention</p>
<p>of the eukaryotic cell or something like this?</p>
<p>Well then, I mean, so I have to get clear</p>
<p>on what you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>So are you coming from a place of wondering</p>
<p>if we are the only conscious mammals?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you really think that&rsquo;s a question?</p>
<p>Can you make a case for it?</p>
<p>Do you really think that&rsquo;s a question?</p>
<p>Take one step back.</p>
<p>We look out at the universe.</p>
<p>At this point in our scientific understanding,</p>
<p>we know that essentially we&rsquo;re all made</p>
<p>of the same ingredients, right?</p>
<p>There are atoms in the universe doing their thing.</p>
<p>They find themselves in different configurations</p>
<p>based on the laws of physics.</p>
<p>And then the question is if we look out</p>
<p>at all of the configurations of atoms in the universe</p>
<p>and ask which of these entail conscious experiences?</p>
<p>Which of these have a felt experience</p>
<p>of being the matter they are?</p>
<p>And there are really only two, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>there are really only two assumptions to make here.</p>
<p>And the first one is the one that science has taken</p>
<p>and that I have for most of my career as well</p>
<p>and that in many ways makes the most sense,</p>
<p>which is electrons aren&rsquo;t conscious, tables aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no felt experience there.</p>
<p>But at a certain point in complex processing,</p>
<p>that processing entails an experience</p>
<p>of being that processing.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s just a fascinating fact all on its own</p>
<p>and I love to spend time thinking about that.</p>
<p>So the question is does consciousness arise at some point?</p>
<p>Are some of these collections of atoms conscious?</p>
<p>Or are all of them?</p>
<p>Because we know the answer isn&rsquo;t none.</p>
<p>I know that I&rsquo;m at least having a conscious experience.</p>
<p>I know that conscious experiences exist in the universe.</p>
<p>And so the answer isn&rsquo;t none.</p>
<p>So the answer has to be all or some.</p>
<p>And this is a starting assumption</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really kind of forced to make</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s all or some.</p>
<p>All or some or one.</p>
<p>I would say one is some also.</p>
<p>We either need an explanation</p>
<p>for why there&rsquo;s non-conscious matter in the universe</p>
<p>and then something happens for consciousness</p>
<p>to come into being.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s part of the fundamental nature of reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also if consciousness is a fundamental property</p>
<p>of reality, it could also choose to not reveal itself</p>
<p>until a certain complexity of organism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that means.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that means either.</p>
<p>Like the flame of consciousness does not start burning</p>
<p>until a certain complexity of organism</p>
<p>is able to reveal it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we can look at consciousness that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I mean many people like to try</p>
<p>to make that argument that it&rsquo;s a spectrum.</p>
<p>Why do we have to say all or nothing maybe?</p>
<p>And I agree that I actually think it is a spectrum.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a spectrum of content,</p>
<p>not of consciousness itself.</p>
<p>So if a worm has some level of conscious experience,</p>
<p>it is extremely minimal, something we could never imagine</p>
<p>being having the complex experience you and I have.</p>
<p>Maybe some felt sensation of pressure or heat</p>
<p>or something super basic, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this range, or even if you just think</p>
<p>of an infant, like the first, the moment an infant</p>
<p>becomes conscious, what that, there&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>very minimal experience of inputs of sound</p>
<p>and light and whatever it is.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a spectrum of content.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a spectrum of how much a system</p>
<p>is consciously experiencing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a moment at which you get on the spectrum.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and I truly believe that,</p>
<p>that piece of it is binary.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s no conscious experience,</p>
<p>there is no consciousness.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say consciousness is there,</p>
<p>it just hasn&rsquo;t lit its flame yet.</p>
<p>If consciousness is there, there&rsquo;s an experience there</p>
<p>by definition.</p>
<p>It has to arise at some point, or it has to always be there.</p>
<p>Is it possible to make the case that that,</p>
<p>it arising happens first, for the first time ever</p>
<p>with Homo sapiens?</p>
<p>I think that is extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>What I think is more possible,</p>
<p>based on what we understand about the brain,</p>
<p>is that it arises in brains or nervous systems.</p>
<p>And so then we&rsquo;re talking about flies and bees</p>
<p>and all kinds of things that fall out of our intuitions</p>
<p>for whether they could be conscious or not.</p>
<p>But I think, especially once you talk about</p>
<p>more complex brains with many, many more neurons,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about cats and dogs and dolphins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to see how there would be a difference</p>
<p>between humans and other mammals in terms of consciousness.</p>
<p>Or is there a difference in terms of intelligence</p>
<p>between humans and other mammals?</p>
<p>Not like a fundamental leap in intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say definitively.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on how you define intelligence</p>
<p>and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>But obviously, humans are unique and capable</p>
<p>of all kinds of things that no other mammals</p>
<p>are capable of.</p>
<p>And there are important differences.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you need any magical intervention</p>
<p>or something outside of the physical world to explain it.</p>
<p>And the way I think about consciousness,</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s part of the reason</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re mistaken about consciousness,</p>
<p>is because we are special in the ways that we&rsquo;re special.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;re complex creatures,</p>
<p>we have these complex brains.</p>
<p>So I think we should probably get into some of the details</p>
<p>of why I think we&rsquo;re confused about what consciousness is.</p>
<p>But just to finish this point,</p>
<p>I think that we don&rsquo;t actually have any evidence</p>
<p>that consciousness is complex,</p>
<p>that it comes out of complex processing,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s required for complex processing.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve made this anthropomorphic mistake</p>
<p>because we are conscious and it&rsquo;s very hard to get evidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that makes consciousness unique</p>
<p>and mysterious and why I&rsquo;m fascinated with it</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s the one thing in nature</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t get conclusive evidence of from the outside.</p>
<p>We can, by analogy, you&rsquo;re behaving basically</p>
<p>the same way I behave, more or less.</p>
<p>You talk about your conscious experiences</p>
<p>and therefore I just extrapolate from that</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re having a felt experience in the way I am</p>
<p>and we can do that throughout nature.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no physical evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing we can observe from the outside</p>
<p>that will give us conclusive proof</p>
<p>that consciousness is there.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;ve made this leap to,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re conscious and because we&rsquo;re unique</p>
<p>and special and complex and intelligent</p>
<p>in the way that we are,</p>
<p>and because we don&rsquo;t have an intuition</p>
<p>that anything else is conscious</p>
<p>or we have no feedback about it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made this assumption that consciousness,</p>
<p>that those things aren&rsquo;t conscious</p>
<p>and felt experience does not exist out there</p>
<p>in other atoms and forms of life even,</p>
<p>but especially not inanimate objects,</p>
<p>and therefore consciousness is somehow tied</p>
<p>to these other things that make us unique,</p>
<p>that consciousness arises</p>
<p>when there is this complex processing, when there is,</p>
<p>and we can talk about the evolution argument too,</p>
<p>which I think is super interesting</p>
<p>to get into, and I&rsquo;m hoping to talk to Richard Dawkins</p>
<p>about this for my series.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he think about consciousness?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not interested.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not interested, and actually the conversation</p>
<p>I would have with him would be very brief</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s just not that interested in this topic,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go back to the Richard Dawkins piece</p>
<p>because I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about here</p>
<p>in terms of our intuitions about consciousness,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s doing, why in my book</p>
<p>and everywhere I talk about consciousness,</p>
<p>I bring it back to these two questions</p>
<p>that I think are at the heart of our intuitions</p>
<p>about consciousness, and so your questions</p>
<p>about whether human beings are unique and special</p>
<p>and all of that I think are interesting questions</p>
<p>and something we could talk about.</p>
<p>I see them as separate questions</p>
<p>from the consciousness question.</p>
<p>So you see consciousness as giving a felt experience</p>
<p>to our uniqueness as opposed to the uniqueness</p>
<p>giving birth to consciousness?</p>
<p>Yes, and that potentially there is felt experience,</p>
<p>even though it sounds crazy even to me,</p>
<p>that there is felt experience in all matter,</p>
<p>and at this point in my thinking</p>
<p>and after a few conversations with some physicists,</p>
<p>I think if consciousness is fundamental,</p>
<p>the only thing that actually makes sense</p>
<p>is that it is part of the most fundamental</p>
<p>that space, time, and everything else emerges out of.</p>
<p>Out of consciousness.</p>
<p>Felt experience is just part of the fabric of reality.</p>
<p>So is it possible to intuit this?</p>
<p>Can we start by thinking about dogs and cats,</p>
<p>go to the plants, and then going all the way to matter,</p>
<p>or is this going to be like modern physics</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just going to be impossible to even,</p>
<p>through our reason alone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to have tools of some kind.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be a little bit of both.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the science has a very long way to go,</p>
<p>and the truth is I don&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>we can get to the science yet</p>
<p>because we have to do this work,</p>
<p>and this is why I&rsquo;m so passionate about this work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really taking hold.</p>
<p>I mean, there are scientists, neuroscientists and physicists</p>
<p>interested in consciousness,</p>
<p>and kind of having gotten over the initial obstacle</p>
<p>of wrestling with these intuitions</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s now being talked about in a serious way,</p>
<p>which was the first huge hurdle.</p>
<p>But I think a lot more of that has to happen,</p>
<p>a lot more of the intuition breaking</p>
<p>from the science we already have.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we almost need to catch our intuitions up</p>
<p>to what we already know,</p>
<p>and then continue to break through these intuitions</p>
<p>systematically so that we can really think</p>
<p>more clearly about consciousness.</p>
<p>There are a couple of scientists now working</p>
<p>on theories of consciousness which do go,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t quite go to the fundamental level,</p>
<p>but they go extremely deep</p>
<p>so that something like an electron</p>
<p>might be conscious under their theory.</p>
<p>This is Integrated Information Theory,</p>
<p>IIT with Christophe Koch and Giulio Tononi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken to both of them.</p>
<p>I spoke to Christophe Koch once or twice</p>
<p>for this project I&rsquo;m working on now.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re working on is incredibly interesting to me,</p>
<p>and I think very important work.</p>
<p>However, I think they are also really led</p>
<p>by some false intuitions about self and free will.</p>
<p>And I think that will be a limit to their work.</p>
<p>So we can get into that, but.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>We will, we will.</p>
<p>Christophe Koch is awesome.</p>
<p>Which is that what they&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>I think, is the most important next step forward,</p>
<p>which is just even being open to the fact</p>
<p>that consciousness goes as deep as particles.</p>
<p>And being rigorous with it.</p>
<p>But even their theory isn&rsquo;t going as deep</p>
<p>as I think we need to go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to say how we could actually</p>
<p>study this scientifically,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s part of the reason why I&rsquo;m such a supporter</p>
<p>of IIT and why I&rsquo;m so interested in what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>even though I think they&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re opening this path.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re getting more people interested,</p>
<p>and I think, yeah, it&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine what the science</p>
<p>will actually look like, but.</p>
<p>Okay, so your intuition, or at least the direction</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re pushing, is that consciousness</p>
<p>is the only fundamental thing in the universe,</p>
<p>that everything else, time,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things emerge from that.</p>
<p>I will say that what I believe at this point,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying 50-50 for a long time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say now it&rsquo;s like 51-49 in terms of consciousness</p>
<p>being emergent versus fundamental.</p>
<p>So I am not convinced of this at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced that consciousness is fundamental.</p>
<p>What I think is there are very good reasons</p>
<p>to think it could be.</p>
<p>And essentially all of science up to this point</p>
<p>has been led by the other assumption,</p>
<p>by the first assumption that consciousness arises</p>
<p>at some point, namely in brains.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where all the science has gone,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s wonderful,</p>
<p>and I think it should keep on going,</p>
<p>and I actually think that was a more important place</p>
<p>to start, but I think there&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>that the correct assumption is that it&rsquo;s fundamental.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the science I support,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing I spend a lot of my time thinking about</p>
<p>and talking to scientists and philosophers about.</p>
<p>And so I shouldn&rsquo;t give the idea that I actually</p>
<p>have crossed over into believing this is the case,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the assumption I follow in my work at this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a possibility, an understudied possibility,</p>
<p>so it deserves serious, rigorous attention.</p>
<p>And there are good reasons to start with that assumption</p>
<p>versus the other that I think we&rsquo;re just now</p>
<p>starting to realize.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, when we&rsquo;re talking about consciousness,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the heart problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>that it feels like something to,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a subjective experience.</p>
<p>Do we, you know, if consciousness permeates all matter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fundamental, is that going to be somehow,</p>
<p>is our current intuition about consciousness,</p>
<p>like the very tiny subset of what consciousness</p>
<p>actually is, so like we have our intuitions</p>
<p>about personal experiences, like what it feels like,</p>
<p>it tastes to eat a cookie or something like that.</p>
<p>But that seems like a very specific implementation</p>
<p>of consciousness in an organism.</p>
<p>So how can we even reason about something that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if consciousness is fundamental,</p>
<p>how can we reason about that?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m understanding the connection</p>
<p>between those two things, but.</p>
<p>When you think about what it&rsquo;s like to be a plant</p>
<p>to experience a thing, okay, we can kind of get that.</p>
<p>We can kind of understand that.</p>
<p>There are a lot of places we could go with this.</p>
<p>One is, there is actually work being done</p>
<p>by people like David Eagleman, he&rsquo;s a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know him.</p>
<p>You should talk to him for your podcast if you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s wonderful, great science communicator.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s someone I interviewed for my current project too.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s done, this actually, okay,</p>
<p>there are many places we can go.</p>
<p>One is, he does work with sensory addition,</p>
<p>sensory substitution, and this is going</p>
<p>in some very interesting directions,</p>
<p>and maybe partly answers your question,</p>
<p>which is giving humans qualia, sensory experiences</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not wired for,</p>
<p>that human beings have never had before.</p>
<p>You let me know what you&rsquo;re most interested</p>
<p>in hearing about.</p>
<p>We could talk about things like the brain port.</p>
<p>There was actually a study done,</p>
<p>I just talked to one of the participants in the study</p>
<p>where they were seeing if they could give human beings</p>
<p>an experience of magnetic north.</p>
<p>So other animals have this sense that we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>where they can feel intuitively the way that our eyes work</p>
<p>to give us an intuitive sense of our environment.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to translate the information</p>
<p>coming in through our eyes,</p>
<p>we just have a map of the external world</p>
<p>and we can navigate it.</p>
<p>So many animals use a sense of magnetic north</p>
<p>to get around, and it&rsquo;s an intuitive sense.</p>
<p>So I spoke to someone who was in this part</p>
<p>of this experiment, and it was fascinating</p>
<p>to hear him acquire a sense,</p>
<p>not only that he had never had,</p>
<p>but that no human being had ever had.</p>
<p>So when I asked him to describe the experience,</p>
<p>it was challenging for him, and understandably so,</p>
<p>because it would be like you describing sight</p>
<p>to someone who&rsquo;s never seen.</p>
<p>But this is clearly possible,</p>
<p>and scientists like David Eagleman and others</p>
<p>are working on these.</p>
<p>And so I do think it&rsquo;s possible that this line,</p>
<p>that these scientific advancements</p>
<p>may actually start to dovetail with the consciousness</p>
<p>research in terms of being able to experience things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never experienced before.</p>
<p>But I do think that at some level, yes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re limited as human beings.</p>
<p>We may be able to find some proof or enough proof</p>
<p>to at least assume that consciousness is fundamental,</p>
<p>or who knows, one day actually believe</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the correct scientific view of things,</p>
<p>and not really be able to get our minds around that</p>
<p>or to understand what it means,</p>
<p>and certainly not to know what it feels like.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t even know what it feels like</p>
<p>to be other creatures.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I guess that&rsquo;s what empathy is about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I tried to exercise,</p>
<p>is try to imagine what it&rsquo;s like to be other people.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re doing that even farther with P tendrils.</p>
<p>But perhaps we can do that thing more rigorously</p>
<p>by connecting different sensory mechanisms to the brain</p>
<p>to do that for all kinds of organisms on Earth.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re similar to Austin&rsquo;s scale</p>
<p>and the time at which they function,</p>
<p>the time scale and the spatial scale.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s much more difficult to do</p>
<p>for electrons and so on.</p>
<p>Some of the intuitions I talked about,</p>
<p>I mean, I just kind of, I&rsquo;m taking them for granted</p>
<p>that you and everyone knows what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>But in terms of the science, in terms of the studies,</p>
<p>understanding things like binding processes,</p>
<p>understanding just a little bit about how the brain works,</p>
<p>and as far as we understand,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just a ton of evidence now to support</p>
<p>that our conscious experience is at the tail end</p>
<p>of a lot of brain processing.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, so just a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, I give, in the example in my book,</p>
<p>I talk about tennis and the binding of the sights</p>
<p>and sounds and felt experience of hitting a tennis ball,</p>
<p>which in the world are happening at different times.</p>
<p>The rates it takes the sound waves and the light waves</p>
<p>and the felt sensation to travel to my brain are different,</p>
<p>that there are these binding processes</p>
<p>that happen prior to the conscious experience</p>
<p>that were essentially delivered to us by the brain.</p>
<p>And so we can get back into this.</p>
<p>I can answer your bigger question first,</p>
<p>but I feel like for a lot of people,</p>
<p>to understand some of the science</p>
<p>that already is shattering some of our intuitions</p>
<p>about the role consciousness plays,</p>
<p>I think is helpful in terms of being able</p>
<p>to be open to thinking about these other ideas.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Where the heck does consciousness happen</p>
<p>in what we understand about the brain timing-wise?</p>
<p>I mean, this connects to conscious will,</p>
<p>to our experience of free will.</p>
<p>There is this period of time,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s depending on the situation and the behavior,</p>
<p>it can be anywhere from,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essentially half a second.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 200 milliseconds.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I was gonna compare it to the timing</p>
<p>of syncing film and sound.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this data.</p>
<p>Yeah, unfortunately I know this very well.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>The film and sound?</p>
<p>Yeah, like how the timing has to work</p>
<p>so that our experiences of it happening</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>Let me just sit in the silence of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been so much pain on this one point.</p>
<p>Sorry, I had no idea.</p>
<p>So, I mean, yeah, I did a lot of algorithms</p>
<p>on automatic synchronization of audio and video</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>and I know this well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of science and there&rsquo;s a lot of differences,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about, and people claim</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about 100 milliseconds,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell the difference,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more like 30 to 50 milliseconds.</p>
<p>And you can go nuts trying to see</p>
<p>if something is in sync or not.</p>
<p>Is it in sync or not?</p>
<p>Well, also, you know, your brain is constantly</p>
<p>making adjustments, and so it can shift for you</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>which is probably part of the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving you crazy.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ll start with binding processes</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll just give a couple examples.</p>
<p>So, yes, there&rsquo;s this window where your brain</p>
<p>is essentially putting all of the information together</p>
<p>to deliver you a present moment experience</p>
<p>that is most useful for you to navigate the world.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I use this example of tennis in my book,</p>
<p>so the sights and sounds are coming at us</p>
<p>at different rates.</p>
<p>It takes longer for a sensation in my hand</p>
<p>when I hit the ball with the racket</p>
<p>to travel to my brain than it does for the light waves</p>
<p>to hit my retina and get processed by the brain.</p>
<p>So all these signals are coming in at different times.</p>
<p>Our brains go through this process of binding</p>
<p>to basically weave it all together</p>
<p>so that our conscious experience of that</p>
<p>is of seeing, hearing, and feeling the ball</p>
<p>hit the racket all at the same time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously most useful to us.</p>
<p>Binding is mostly about timing.</p>
<p>It can be about other things,</p>
<p>but I was just talking to David Eagleman</p>
<p>who was talking about a very simple experiment, actually,</p>
<p>and this kind of shows how your brain</p>
<p>is basically always interacting with the outside world</p>
<p>and always making adjustments to make its best guess</p>
<p>about the most useful present moment experience to deliver.</p>
<p>So this is a very simple experiment.</p>
<p>This is from many, many years ago,</p>
<p>and David Eagleman was involved in this research</p>
<p>where they had participants hit a button</p>
<p>and that button caused a flash of light.</p>
<p>So our brains, through binding,</p>
<p>the brain notices, is able to kind of calibrate</p>
<p>the experience you have because the brain is aware</p>
<p>that it is its own hand that is causing</p>
<p>the light to flash,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this cause and effect going on,</p>
<p>and so you have this experience of pushing the button</p>
<p>that causes the flash of light, which is true,</p>
<p>and the light flashes.</p>
<p>You can start to introduce longer pauses,</p>
<p>starting with 20 milliseconds, 30 milliseconds,</p>
<p>going up to, I think, 100, maybe even 200 milliseconds,</p>
<p>where if you do it gradually,</p>
<p>since your brain is making the adjustment,</p>
<p>you can introduce a delay.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s up to 200 milliseconds.</p>
<p>If you do it gradually, you will still have the experience,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s now a delay</p>
<p>between when you hit the button and the light flashes,</p>
<p>you will still have the exact same experience you had</p>
<p>initially, which is that the light flashes</p>
<p>right when you push the button.</p>
<p>In your experience, nothing is changing.</p>
<p>But then, so they gradually give a delay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve acclimated to that because it was done gradually.</p>
<p>If they then go back to the original instantaneous flash,</p>
<p>your brain doesn&rsquo;t have time to make the adjustment,</p>
<p>and you have the experience that the light flashed</p>
<p>before you hit the button.</p>
<p>And that is your true experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re confused,</p>
<p>but that is, your brain didn&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>to make that adjustment.</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;re in the same environment.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pushing the button.</p>
<p>It makes the light flash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of calibrating all the time,</p>
<p>but then the participants are suddenly saying,</p>
<p>oh, wait, that was so weird.</p>
<p>The light flashed before I hit the button.</p>
<p>And so these types of, they built a Rochambeau,</p>
<p>rock, paper, scissors, computer game</p>
<p>that was unbeatable based on this glitch</p>
<p>that you can present in binding by training someone.</p>
<p>If you introduce a delay slowly enough,</p>
<p>then the computer can get the information</p>
<p>before it responds,</p>
<p>but you still have the experience</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re both throwing out your rock</p>
<p>or paper or scissors at the same time.</p>
<p>But in actuality, the computer saw your choice</p>
<p>before it makes its choice.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in this window of milliseconds</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
<p>So that starts to help you build up an intuition</p>
<p>that this conscious experience is an illusion.</p>
<p>Constructed by the brain after-</p>
<p>Conscious will.</p>
<p>Conscious will.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just in general that consciousness</p>
<p>is not the thing that we feel it is,</p>
<p>which is driving the behavior,</p>
<p>that is actually at the tail end of it.</p>
<p>And so a lot of decision-making processes,</p>
<p>and there are studies that are more controversial,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t usually like to cite them,</p>
<p>although if you want to talk about them, we can.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re super interesting and intuition-shattering,</p>
<p>but there are now studies specifically about free will</p>
<p>to see if there are markers at the level of the brain</p>
<p>that can see what decision you&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>and when you make that decision.</p>
<p>And I think the neuroscience inevitably</p>
<p>is just going to get better.</p>
<p>And so part of the reason I&rsquo;m so passionate about this,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s the science and there&rsquo;s just the curiosity</p>
<p>that drives me of wanting to understand</p>
<p>how the universe works.</p>
<p>But I actually see a lot of the neuroscience</p>
<p>presenting us with truths that are going to be difficult</p>
<p>for us to accept.</p>
<p>And I actually think there are really positive ways</p>
<p>to view these truths that we&rsquo;re uncovering.</p>
<p>And even though they can be initially kind of jarring</p>
<p>and even destabilizing and creepy,</p>
<p>I think ultimately there&rsquo;s actually a lot,</p>
<p>it can have a positive effect on human psychology</p>
<p>and a whole range of things</p>
<p>that I and others have experienced.</p>
<p>And that I think it&rsquo;s important for us to talk about</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t hide from the truth,</p>
<p>especially in science, right?</p>
<p>Like it just, it will reveal itself.</p>
<p>And if this is true, I think not only</p>
<p>for better understanding the universe and nature,</p>
<p>which is kind of my primary passion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for us to</p>
<p>absorb these facts and realize that they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily take away</p>
<p>the things from us that we fear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard people say, as was talked about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a common point to make or question to ask a scientist,</p>
<p>can you still enjoy chocolate</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a molecular biologist</p>
<p>and is it a molecular biologist</p>
<p>that would be the one who would understand</p>
<p>how we experience chocolate?</p>
<p>I may have the wrong science.</p>
<p>But anyway, if you&rsquo;re focused on the details</p>
<p>of the underlying nature of reality,</p>
<p>does that take the joy and the pleasure</p>
<p>and for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>spirituality out of our experience as human beings?</p>
<p>And I actually think for these illusions</p>
<p>like free will and self, the reverse is true.</p>
<p>I actually think they can give us,</p>
<p>they are reasons and bases for</p>
<p>feeling more connected to each other and to the universe,</p>
<p>for spiritual experiences,</p>
<p>for even just on a more basic level,</p>
<p>for increasing our wellbeing,</p>
<p>just in terms of our psychology</p>
<p>of lowering rates of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>And I actually think these realizations</p>
<p>can be extremely helpful to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like realizing that the universe</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t rotate around Earth,</p>
<p>that the Earth is not the center of the universe</p>
<p>is a really challenging thought.</p>
<p>Well, and people were worried about</p>
<p>how that would affect society.</p>
<p>Well, yes, that&rsquo;s like long-term,</p>
<p>but short-term, I bet you the number of people</p>
<p>who had an existential crisis</p>
<p>as it got integrated into society, that thought is huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying-</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s also a source of awe.</p>
<p>And I mean, so many people now use that fact</p>
<p>to inspire a positive response,</p>
<p>to inspire creativity and curiosity and awe</p>
<p>and all of these things that are so</p>
<p>useful for human wellbeing.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the source of meaning</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not the center of the universe,</p>
<p>when the you doesn&rsquo;t even exist,</p>
<p>that even you, the sense of self</p>
<p>and the sense of decision-making is an illusion?</p>
<p>The truth is that for the most part,</p>
<p>the sense of self is kind of at the core of human suffering</p>
<p>because it feels as if we are separate</p>
<p>from the rest of nature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re separate from each other.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re separate from the illusion that I referenced</p>
<p>of feeling like we have these thoughts</p>
<p>that are brain-based thoughts,</p>
<p>but then the I swoops in to make a decision.</p>
<p>In some sense, it goes so deep that it&rsquo;s as if</p>
<p>the I is separate from the physical world.</p>
<p>And that separation plays a part in depression,</p>
<p>plays a part in anxiety, even plays a part in addiction.</p>
<p>So at the level of the brain,</p>
<p>I think, stop me if I&rsquo;m repeating myself,</p>
<p>but we started talking about the default mode network.</p>
<p>And so we actually know that</p>
<p>when the default mode network is quieted down,</p>
<p>when people lose a sense of self in meditation</p>
<p>and on psychedelic drugs in therapy,</p>
<p>there is a feeling that people describe</p>
<p>of an extremely positive feeling</p>
<p>of being connected to the rest of nature.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a piece of it that I think</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t had the experience,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily know that would be a part of it.</p>
<p>But truly having that insight</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not the self you feel you are,</p>
<p>immediately your experiences are embedded in the universe</p>
<p>and you are a piece of everything</p>
<p>and you see that everything is interconnected.</p>
<p>And so rather than feeling like a lonely I</p>
<p>in this bigger universe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense of being a part</p>
<p>of something larger than yourself.</p>
<p>And this is intrinsically positive for human beings.</p>
<p>And even just in our everyday lives</p>
<p>and choices and what we do for work,</p>
<p>feeling part of something larger than yourself</p>
<p>is the way people describe spiritual experiences</p>
<p>and the way many positive psychological states are framed.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s that piece of it.</p>
<p>There is something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one giant hug with the universe, everything in it.</p>
<p>But there is some sense in which we attach</p>
<p>the search for meaning with the I, with the ego.</p>
<p>And it could almost seem like life is meaningless.</p>
<p>Our existence, our I, my existence is meaningless.</p>
<p>I think you can kind of go there under any worldview,</p>
<p>really.</p>
<p>And the truth is we want to find a truth</p>
<p>out of that downward spiral</p>
<p>and not a story that we have to tell ourselves</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>And the fact is we have these facts available to us</p>
<p>that with the right framing and the right context,</p>
<p>looking at the truth actually provides us</p>
<p>with that psychological feeling we&rsquo;re searching for.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s important to point out.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>I think humans are fascinatingly good</p>
<p>at finding beauty in truth</p>
<p>no matter how painful the truth is.</p>
<p>So yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I totally agree.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But in this case, I think there are,</p>
<p>the concerns are legitimate concerns</p>
<p>and I have them myself for how people respond.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had people tell me</p>
<p>they had to stop reading my book halfway through</p>
<p>because the parts on free will were so upsetting to them.</p>
<p>And this is something I think about a lot</p>
<p>because that kind of breaks my heart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, because I see this potential</p>
<p>for these realizations bringing levels of wellbeing</p>
<p>that many people don&rsquo;t have access to,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to talk about them</p>
<p>in ways that override what can be an initial</p>
<p>fear or kind of spooky quality</p>
<p>that can come out of these realizations.</p>
<p>So at the end of that journey,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a clarity and an appreciation of beauty</p>
<p>that if you just write it out.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to read upsetting,</p>
<p>I just gotten through the boy,</p>
<p>the four books, if you want to read upsetting.</p>
<p>So my audible is hilarious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s conscious in it.</p>
<p>And then, so your book.</p>
<p>And then it has the rise and fall of the third Reich.</p>
<p>Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder,</p>
<p>probably the most upsetting book I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>
<p>If you want to, because it&rsquo;s not just Stalin or Hitler,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Stalin and Hitler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the worst hits, the opposite of the best hits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really, really well written, really difficult.</p>
<p>I read Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s Gulag Archipelago.</p>
<p>And what else?</p>
<p>Red Famine, which is,</p>
<p>and Applebaum, does that hurt?</p>
<p>Yeah, anyway, so those are truly upsetting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and those are a lot of times</p>
<p>the results of hiding the truth versus pursuing the truth.</p>
<p>So truth in the short term might hurt,</p>
<p>but it did ultimately set this free.</p>
<p>I believe that.</p>
<p>And I also think whatever the truth is,</p>
<p>we have to find a way to maintain civil society and love</p>
<p>and all the things that are important to us.</p>
<p>If we can jump around a little bit.</p>
<p>Can I just ask on a personal note,</p>
<p>because you said you&rsquo;ve suffered from depression</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people that see guidance on this topic</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a difficult one.</p>
<p>How were you able to, when it has struck you,</p>
<p>how were you able to overcome it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is maybe too long an answer.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve experienced it in different forms.</p>
<p>So it was my, I would say my depression</p>
<p>has almost always mostly taken the form of anxiety.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize how anxious I was,</p>
<p>I think, until I was an adult.</p>
<p>So I was always very functional.</p>
<p>I think, you know, all the positive sides</p>
<p>of suffering in that way.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a little OCD as you can tell.</p>
<p>I mean, this whole conversation is hilarious</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re both suffering to some level of anxiety.</p>
<p>Your psychology is just laid out in front of us here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a giant mess.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the same kind of human, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Just trying to organize.</p>
<p>Just hold on, like the Tom Waits song.</p>
<p>But then I suffered from postpartum depression</p>
<p>after both of my daughters, after both pregnancies.</p>
<p>That was a very different experience</p>
<p>from anything I&rsquo;ve ever experienced</p>
<p>but clearly I had a predisposition</p>
<p>towards suffering from something like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, it really wasn&rsquo;t until I fully recovered</p>
<p>from the second experience of postpartum depression</p>
<p>that I realized</p>
<p>that I had been suffering on some level my whole life.</p>
<p>And I think I always knew,</p>
<p>I thought of myself as a very sensitive person,</p>
<p>an empathic person.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been in therapy for 10 years.</p>
<p>I knew I had a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p>I would never have denied that I had a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t realize it crossed over into</p>
<p>a disorder really until I was an adult</p>
<p>and ended up taking Prozac.</p>
<p>I took an SSRI for postpartum</p>
<p>and it was fascinating to me.</p>
<p>I ended up interviewing my psychiatrist</p>
<p>because I was so fascinated in the whole thing</p>
<p>once I was on the other side of it,</p>
<p>just what I had been through,</p>
<p>how different I felt during that period of time</p>
<p>and then how quickly the medication</p>
<p>made me feel like myself again.</p>
<p>I had come out the other side</p>
<p>of the experience of postpartum</p>
<p>and was going to start tapering off the medication.</p>
<p>And in this window</p>
<p>where I no longer had postpartum depression,</p>
<p>and hadn&rsquo;t yet gone off the SSRI,</p>
<p>I realized that life was not only a lot easier</p>
<p>than when I had postpartum,</p>
<p>but it was easier than it had ever been.</p>
<p>And it took taking all of that anxiety away</p>
<p>to recognize how much I had been grappling with it</p>
<p>my entire life.</p>
<p>And it first started coming in the form of realizations</p>
<p>like, oh, is this how other people feel?</p>
<p>Is this how other people feel?</p>
<p>Is this how that,</p>
<p>like the things that I just always thought of myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sensitive, I&rsquo;m an introvert,</p>
<p>I need a lot of time to myself</p>
<p>and all of these things that I felt like,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s always very high functioning.</p>
<p>And in some ways, I was a professional dancer</p>
<p>and I think that was the type of therapy for me.</p>
<p>There was the obsessing over</p>
<p>the training and dancing nine hours a day</p>
<p>and all of that, I now look back on</p>
<p>and see how much that was therapeutic for me</p>
<p>and that I was kind of treating something.</p>
<p>But yeah, so it was just this experience</p>
<p>of treating an anxiety disorder</p>
<p>that caused me to realize that I had one.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know I could feel the way I felt</p>
<p>after taking Prozac.</p>
<p>And I became very interested in,</p>
<p>I mean, I was already working with neuroscientists,</p>
<p>I was already interested in consciousness and the brain</p>
<p>and it just, this kind of rattled other intuitions for me</p>
<p>in terms of how our childhoods shape who we become.</p>
<p>Because I had been convinced, my father was,</p>
<p>my father was-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a complicated person, as you said before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was just gonna say again.</p>
<p>I mean, so he was not diagnosed,</p>
<p>I think he had borderline personality disorder</p>
<p>and was emotionally abusive.</p>
<p>And I thought that all of the ways I experienced the world</p>
<p>and all of my anxiety and my sensitivities,</p>
<p>I thought almost all of that, if not all of that,</p>
<p>was because of these experiences I had growing up</p>
<p>and trauma that I experienced as a child.</p>
<p>And obviously those things play a part,</p>
<p>but what I realized after going through postpartum</p>
<p>and then the thing that was extremely informative to me</p>
<p>was having my own children.</p>
<p>Because they were basically living my dream childhood.</p>
<p>They had none of the things that I thought were the cause</p>
<p>of the psychological suffering that I experienced.</p>
<p>There was none of that.</p>
<p>And they have a lot of the same,</p>
<p>they struggle with a lot of the same anxiety</p>
<p>and panic attacks.</p>
<p>And what I realized was</p>
<p>how much we&rsquo;re kind of born into the world</p>
<p>with these things that we struggle with</p>
<p>and with our strengths and with all of that.</p>
<p>And of course, then if you have an abusive childhood,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re someone who tends to be anxious</p>
<p>and sensitive and empathic,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re born into an abusive situation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s obviously a terrible combination.</p>
<p>But I never acknowledged or realized how strong</p>
<p>just the genetics and the wiring played.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the line between you kind of accepting</p>
<p>the challenges you&rsquo;re born with,</p>
<p>and this is what life will be,</p>
<p>versus then figuring out that life can be somehow different?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re part of the same process.</p>
<p>And I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of necessary to accept</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re experiencing and what the situation is</p>
<p>and how you feel and the types of thoughts and patterns</p>
<p>you tend toward in order to make</p>
<p>whatever changes can be made.</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s kind of part of the same process.</p>
<p>Could life have been any different?</p>
<p>Mary, do you regret certain aspects</p>
<p>of the decisions made, not by you?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on what level we&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>I think at a fundamental level,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe anything could be different.</p>
<p>Are you able to think at that level about your own life?</p>
<p>Sure, and that&rsquo;s actually, that&rsquo;s part of what I was,</p>
<p>when I wanted to kind of talk a little bit about</p>
<p>the levels of usefulness of being aware</p>
<p>of these different illusions.</p>
<p>Because I would say most of the time in our daily lives,</p>
<p>the types of illusions that I&rsquo;m interested in shaking up</p>
<p>are not useful to remind ourselves of most of the time.</p>
<p>I really think there are different levels of usefulness</p>
<p>to thinking about and reminding ourselves</p>
<p>of the places where we have false intuitions.</p>
<p>And so I often use</p>
<p>the analogy of living on a sphere.</p>
<p>So it still feels to most of us, most of the time,</p>
<p>I mean, our intuitive sense,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not thinking about whether the Earth is flat</p>
<p>or a sphere, but we behave as if it&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<p>And that makes the most sense.</p>
<p>And it would be exhausting to keep reminding ourselves</p>
<p>as we walk down the street, like it feels flat,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not flat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no reason to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not useful in that moment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building a house,</p>
<p>you can build it as if the world is flat.</p>
<p>But of course, so there are psychological reasons</p>
<p>to bring it into view,</p>
<p>and maybe even spiritual reasons to bring it into view.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s just like usefulness.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re building a rocket to the moon,</p>
<p>you better understand the geometry of the Earth.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re flying an airplane,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an airplane pilot,</p>
<p>you have to be aware of the truth of our situation.</p>
<p>And then I think there are other places</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s interesting to remind ourselves</p>
<p>is where I start out my book,</p>
<p>just as a way to inspire awe</p>
<p>and to get yourself out of your everyday life</p>
<p>and see the big picture,</p>
<p>which can be just a relief,</p>
<p>but also helps you feel more connected to the universe</p>
<p>and to something larger than ourselves.</p>
<p>And so I see these intuitions reminding ourselves</p>
<p>that these intuitions are illusions in the same way,</p>
<p>that most of the time they&rsquo;re not useful.</p>
<p>They are useful if we want to think</p>
<p>about a science of consciousness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re useful for a whole range</p>
<p>of neuroscientific studies.</p>
<p>And I think they can be incredibly useful</p>
<p>in the same way that lying on the ground</p>
<p>and feeling the gravity pushing you against a sphere</p>
<p>and realizing you&rsquo;re floating in the middle of outer space,</p>
<p>it gives me the same feeling to realize.</p>
<p>And so I have, I mean, there&rsquo;s so many levels to it,</p>
<p>but if I&rsquo;m thinking about difficult things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve experienced, different traumas in my life,</p>
<p>when I take a step back and kind of get this bird&rsquo;s eye view</p>
<p>of kind of the mystery of this unfolding of the universe</p>
<p>and the fact that it happened the way it happened</p>
<p>and whether it could have happened another way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no going back, that&rsquo;s the way it unfolded.</p>
<p>And being able to surrender to that,</p>
<p>I think is very psychologically healthy</p>
<p>and prevents us from, I mean, I think regret</p>
<p>is one of the most toxic loops we can get into.</p>
<p>So this is a path to acceptance.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, yeah, because free will,</p>
<p>I mean, I think part of what the function</p>
<p>of the experience of it is, is learning.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we can still learn</p>
<p>without being under the illusion that we have free will.</p>
<p>So for some people, depression can destroy them.</p>
<p>So how can you think about avoiding that?</p>
<p>Avoiding that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I didn&rsquo;t totally answer your question.</p>
<p>First is therapy, ways that I have worked</p>
<p>through anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re an introvert and a deeply intellectual person,</p>
<p>therapy works for you?</p>
<p>To a point.</p>
<p>It was very helpful.</p>
<p>I mean, I think talk therapy is one tool</p>
<p>and can be helpful for, I mean,</p>
<p>it depends on the therapist, depends on the type of therapy,</p>
<p>but I found it to be one piece</p>
<p>and probably not the biggest piece, actually.</p>
<p>But I think, I wish I had discovered medication sooner.</p>
<p>That would have made a big difference in my life.</p>
<p>Even just intellectually to realize that,</p>
<p>oh, like I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Life was a lot harder than it needed to be.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t about keeping everything just so.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another state my brain can be in</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t have to work so hard to be okay.</p>
<p>Meditation was probably the most,</p>
<p>meditation and psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>were probably the most transformative.</p>
<p>But a lot of these things, I&rsquo;m lucky that I didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>my anxiety and depression never really got in the way</p>
<p>of my living my life, of enjoying my life.</p>
<p>I mean, there were struggles.</p>
<p>It made life harder for me.</p>
<p>But something like treatment-resistant depression</p>
<p>or severe PTSD, these are things that,</p>
<p>at this point in time, based on my understanding,</p>
<p>I think once you&rsquo;ve tried,</p>
<p>and the truth is that meditation is often not helpful</p>
<p>for those things.</p>
<p>It can actually exacerbate them.</p>
<p>And the most promising thing that I have seen</p>
<p>is this research into psychedelic,</p>
<p>therapy-assisted psychedelic.</p>
<p>Does that make sense to you, that psychedelics work so well</p>
<p>for such difficult cases?</p>
<p>What is it about psychedelics?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been following this research from the beginning.</p>
<p>When they were doing end-of-life,</p>
<p>they started with end-of-life patients,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe 20 years ago.</p>
<p>I met, at a TED conference,</p>
<p>I met one of the doctors who was doing this research.</p>
<p>It was the first time I became aware</p>
<p>that the research was happening,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d already had my own experiences before that.</p>
<p>And so it made perfect sense to me that this would work.</p>
<p>It was still astonishing to see the results,</p>
<p>to see how successful the work is so much of the time.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me it makes sense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually in line with all of these other things.</p>
<p>So quieting down the default mode network.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s so transformative</p>
<p>about taking something like psilocybin,</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s experience is different,</p>
<p>it can vary each time you take it,</p>
<p>even in a single person.</p>
<p>But the experience I had,</p>
<p>and the experience that many people have</p>
<p>that is so transformative,</p>
<p>is this feeling that&rsquo;s very hard to describe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a feeling of being one with the universe.</p>
<p>And that comes with, it&rsquo;s kind of all one feeling</p>
<p>that is, again, hard to put into words,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this feeling that everything is okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d never had that feeling before in my life.</p>
<p>And when I took psychedelics,</p>
<p>that feeling would stay with me for months.</p>
<p>And I never understood why,</p>
<p>and it was always fascinating to me,</p>
<p>but it was as if I was glimpsing</p>
<p>a deeper truth of the world that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all one thing, we&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sense that there could even be</p>
<p>a feeling of loneliness.</p>
<p>It was just this visceral sense</p>
<p>of being one with everything,</p>
<p>and that everything was okay,</p>
<p>that all the things I was afraid of, even death,</p>
<p>that the universe, in a sense,</p>
<p>is just an endless recycling.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s hard to describe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s hard to describe.</p>
<p>But we also know, on the other side,</p>
<p>that depression and anxiety,</p>
<p>when people are experiencing those things,</p>
<p>the default mode network is more active.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this cycling and this kind of obsessive cycles</p>
<p>of thinking about one&rsquo;s self</p>
<p>that is a huge part of the suffering in the first place.</p>
<p>And so the one thing that&rsquo;s surprising to me</p>
<p>about the research is that,</p>
<p>I may be fudging the data,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something like 80% of people</p>
<p>who are treated for PTSD after one,</p>
<p>only one session, are cured of their PTSD.</p>
<p>Yeah, the effect stays for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And addiction as well, which is interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m personally familiar with,</p>
<p>so that was a surprise to me.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s just wonderful that we&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, it&rsquo;s also incredible</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t suffer</p>
<p>to see what psychedelics can do with the mind,</p>
<p>which is that kind of appreciation.</p>
<p>Well, and I think it&rsquo;s actually important for this work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the questions I ask everyone I talk to</p>
<p>for this series.</p>
<p>Many of them, you know,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to use that audio.</p>
<p>Oh, ask them if they&rsquo;ve done psychedelics?</p>
<p>Yes, and what their experience was,</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s informed.</p>
<p>You know, actually, initially in the 50s,</p>
<p>I want to do more research on this and look into it,</p>
<p>but in the 50s, there were some studies</p>
<p>that were being done with scientists who,</p>
<p>there were hundreds of scientists they put into the study</p>
<p>where they were on the brink of some kind of discovery,</p>
<p>where they were stuck.</p>
<p>So they had been doing research, and they were stuck,</p>
<p>and they used psychedelics to come up with an answer</p>
<p>to find a path forward,</p>
<p>and it was extremely useful for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And the nice thing about psychedelics, from my perception,</p>
<p>is that they don&rsquo;t currently suffer</p>
<p>from the taboo that weed does.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>So like, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind of cultural construct about a pothead</p>
<p>that makes it so that, you know,</p>
<p>like Elon got in trouble for smoking weed.</p>
<p>Right, he would have gotten in trouble</p>
<p>for taking mushrooms, too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a surprise to me.</p>
<p>Because mushrooms to me seem like a journey,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a perception</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t take mushrooms all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an addictive substance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a lifestyle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like going to Burning Man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an experience that stays with you for a long time.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t realize that understanding</p>
<p>had permeated into the culture.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question of if it has or not,</p>
<p>because maybe I have a very narrow perspective</p>
<p>of these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I think what has permeated is through Hollywood ideas</p>
<p>of what it means to be a person who smokes weed a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that has like, has had its effect,</p>
<p>which is hilarious given the effects of weed versus alcohol.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a whole nother story.</p>
<p>Have you taken psychedelics?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve spoken about it on your podcast?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so it&rsquo;s not a lot.</p>
<p>I really want to do a lot more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken mushrooms.</p>
<p>Vaspirations.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, because it&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t have, I have a very addictive personality,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m very nervous about substances,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have any addictive relationship</p>
<p>with that thing.</p>
<p>Every time I-</p>
<p>It is a treatment for addiction, so.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>But I, you know, I&rsquo;m almost nervous</p>
<p>because every time I&rsquo;ve taken mushrooms,</p>
<p>had a really pleasant experience.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, it&rsquo;s already the thing I feel anyway,</p>
<p>but I feel it more intensely.</p>
<p>The thing I feel anyway is like appreciation of the moment,</p>
<p>how beautiful life is.</p>
<p>The weird thing that I feel, not throughout the day,</p>
<p>but certain moments of the day, especially early on,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like life is intensely beautiful.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s usually when I&rsquo;ll tweet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Everything is awesome.</p>
<p>And I remember those feelings</p>
<p>because sometimes when I feel really down</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>you remember that it&rsquo;s a rollercoaster</p>
<p>and you just, and then you find the good feelings</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And it does make me a little bit sad</p>
<p>that they kind of fade,</p>
<p>but then as I get older, you get to use those moments.</p>
<p>You realize that, use them well, you know?</p>
<p>When you feel great, when you&rsquo;re focused,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, use them well</p>
<p>because the mind is a rollercoaster.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s partly why I do this work.</p>
<p>I feel like my work is therapy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you feel that way.</p>
<p>Work is therapy.</p>
<p>This work, not work in general.</p>
<p>Thinking about the deep questions,</p>
<p>thinking about the nature of the universe,</p>
<p>thinking about consciousness, even meditation.</p>
<p>I mean, I got into meditation.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>To me, I think a lot of meditators feel this way about it,</p>
<p>but I think just, I&rsquo;m thinking about it</p>
<p>from the perspective of someone</p>
<p>who hasn&rsquo;t meditated before,</p>
<p>but it feels like a scientific experiment.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s the same physicist in me</p>
<p>who was drawn to meditation</p>
<p>because the experience is one of getting closer</p>
<p>to your experience and asking similarly deep questions</p>
<p>like what is time?</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>What do I mean by time?</p>
<p>What does it feel like?</p>
<p>What is a thought</p>
<p>is one of the most interesting questions to me.</p>
<p>How do you meditate?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>So what, you let go of time.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not really doing anything.</p>
<p>I mean, the exercise is really so simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just paying attention</p>
<p>to your present moment experience,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an extremely challenging thing to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the natural state of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exercise in concentration,</p>
<p>which is why athletes and other people</p>
<p>who spend a lot of time needing to focus intensely</p>
<p>find it so useful.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really a focus, a concentration practice,</p>
<p>but all it is really, I mean, there are different ways,</p>
<p>there are different methods,</p>
<p>but it really is quite simple at its core,</p>
<p>which is just paying close attention</p>
<p>to your present moment experience.</p>
<p>And so in Vipassana,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;ve mostly been trained in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re usually paying attention to the breath,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s always some focus of concentration.</p>
<p>And the focus can even be just an open awareness,</p>
<p>just watching your mind go,</p>
<p>just what comes into your experience.</p>
<p>And part of that is the mind,</p>
<p>part of it is the external world.</p>
<p>So you hear a sound, you think a thought,</p>
<p>you feel a feeling, your cheek is itching.</p>
<p>Am I gonna scratch it, am I not gonna scratch it?</p>
<p>Just like, sounds like the most boring thing in the world.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is,</p>
<p>paying close attention to the most boring thing</p>
<p>in the world is incredibly fascinating.</p>
<p>Noticing that each breath, no two breaths are the same,</p>
<p>that time keeps moving, that your thoughts keep appearing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a spiritual practice</p>
<p>for a reason.</p>
<p>You notice more and more beautiful things</p>
<p>about the simpler, simpler things, yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I like to do that, I don&rsquo;t meditate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a few times, and I will.</p>
<p>But I meditate, I do meditate,</p>
<p>but I meditate by thinking about a thing,</p>
<p>and holding onto that thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really, I guess, technically meditation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s keeping a focus on an idea,</p>
<p>and then you walk with it,</p>
<p>and you solve the little puzzle of it.</p>
<p>Especially any kind of programming or math stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re holding stuff in your head.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t look stuff up, don&rsquo;t take notes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only allowed to have your mind, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You would really enjoy a meditation retreat.</p>
<p>I mean, you would also not enjoy it.</p>
<p>It would be hard because it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t go nuts, it would be hard.</p>
<p>But you would get a ton out of it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a meditation retreat, is it usually silent, or?</p>
<p>It is always silent, or actually,</p>
<p>at least the one I would recommend you do</p>
<p>is a silent meditation retreat, five days.</p>
<p>Five days, okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk later, but you might be my next victim.</p>
<p>I have, I have, I have, I have.</p>
<p>Five days is a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>To just sit.</p>
<p>It changes your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the type of experience</p>
<p>that will change your brain permanently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been like two, three, four hour sessions</p>
<p>of thinking that break in.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have children.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have children.</p>
<p>Oh, the children.</p>
<p>Leaving them for five days and not speaking, impossible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only done one retreat since I had kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing another one soon.</p>
<p>But only two nights.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what the thoughts will be coming in my head.</p>
<p>You should be getting married, you should have kids.</p>
<p>Whatever, let the thoughts be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get really good at letting things just be,</p>
<p>and focusing on the present moment.</p>
<p>And you might come out with some epiphany</p>
<p>about what you should do next.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I love the idea, obviously.</p>
<p>I love the idea.</p>
<p>I love the idea, you know, I fast for three days.</p>
<p>I wanna fast for longer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also in a different way, perhaps,</p>
<p>but it brings you, makes you more sensitive</p>
<p>to the world around you somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what the chemistry of that is.</p>
<p>But obviously, you&rsquo;re, actually it&rsquo;s not obvious,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not always that hungry.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re more, time slows down, and you feel things.</p>
<p>You feel a breeze, all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, I think, tweeted something about ideas</p>
<p>coming out from, sometimes feeling about</p>
<p>coming from outside of you sometimes.</p>
<p>So you mentioned as you meditate,</p>
<p>you know, you notice these ideas come in.</p>
<p>So, thoughts, ideas, how did that connect to consciousness?</p>
<p>So the thing I was responding to that you wrote,</p>
<p>I think I was partly picking up on the part of you</p>
<p>that would really get a lot out of a meditation retreat.</p>
<p>That was my way of beginning that conversation.</p>
<p>That experience you had of a thought</p>
<p>coming from somewhere else,</p>
<p>when you spend an extended period of time</p>
<p>paying close attention to your moment-to-moment experience,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how all of your thoughts appear to you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really beautiful, because you&rsquo;re letting go.</p>
<p>Just through the practice of meditation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re quieting down your default mode network.</p>
<p>And without necessarily intellectually thinking yourself</p>
<p>out of free will, it naturally kind of drops away.</p>
<p>And so, when you&rsquo;re under the spell of this illusion</p>
<p>that you are the author of your thoughts,</p>
<p>and your conscious experience is driving</p>
<p>all of your behavior, and there&rsquo;s this I that stands</p>
<p>somewhere near your brain, but is not your brain,</p>
<p>that stands free of the physical world,</p>
<p>is the thing generating the thoughts,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re meditating, that quiets down</p>
<p>and can kind of quiet down completely</p>
<p>so that your experience is just of the next thing arising</p>
<p>in your conscious awareness.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>But the source of that is still this brain.</p>
<p>What you realize is the source of it</p>
<p>is not your conscious experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the important insight.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the insight.</p>
<p>And so there are many insights you can have in meditation</p>
<p>that align with the science,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>I can imagine finding meditation to be extremely useful</p>
<p>and helping me with anxiety and all the rest,</p>
<p>and having all kinds of insights</p>
<p>that turn out to not be true.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing is that these insights</p>
<p>actually turn out to be true.</p>
<p>And so that is one of them, is the&hellip;</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re just watching</p>
<p>what your conscious experience actually is,</p>
<p>you realize that it&rsquo;s not doing all of the things</p>
<p>you usually feel like it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And so the thoughts really just arise</p>
<p>in much the same way that a sound or a sight or a feeling,</p>
<p>maybe your leg starts to hurt,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just watching moment by moment by moment,</p>
<p>pain arises, a bird chirping arises,</p>
<p>a thought arises, a feeling arises.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just kind of watching it all unfold.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something really beautiful about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>The perspective you could take on is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a connectedness to the entirety of the universe,</p>
<p>like to nature in general.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s something so beautiful about consciousness,</p>
<p>about the fact that it&rsquo;s not just a dead universe</p>
<p>with atoms doing their thing,</p>
<p>that at least in this one instance,</p>
<p>there is a felt experience of the universe.</p>
<p>Of the universe, it&rsquo;s not even individual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of the universe, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Right here in this little point in space and time,</p>
<p>there is an experience of the universe.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still interesting to think about</p>
<p>where those ideas,</p>
<p>if those ideas are solely a construction of the brain,</p>
<p>or is there some kind of mechanism</p>
<p>of joint collective intelligence of humans</p>
<p>as social organisms?</p>
<p>How much of it is</p>
<p>me training my neural network</p>
<p>and the ideas of tens of thousands of other people?</p>
<p>And how much is it myself?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking in terms of psychic phenomena,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking in terms of just absorbing</p>
<p>the information of the past and education</p>
<p>and just kind of our collective human project</p>
<p>that gets in throughout our lives.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about psychic phenomena,</p>
<p>but I also wanna be open-minded</p>
<p>in the way we speak about collective intelligence,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very easy to simplify it to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a neural network trained on knowledge</p>
<p>developed over generations and so on.</p>
<p>It does feel like intelligence is stored</p>
<p>in some kind of distributed fashion across humans.</p>
<p>If you take one out,</p>
<p>I think that intelligence quickly goes down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how quickly it goes down</p>
<p>if you just take one out.</p>
<p>It depends on which one.</p>
<p>I think I half agree and half disagree</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>But yeah, the other thing you notice</p>
<p>when you spend a lot of time in meditation</p>
<p>and when you spend a lot of time</p>
<p>kind of shaking up these intuitions</p>
<p>that I think get in the way of clearly</p>
<p>thinking about what consciousness is,</p>
<p>is that we are these systems in nature</p>
<p>that are not at all isolated.</p>
<p>And there are the obvious ways,</p>
<p>like if I just stop drinking water,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna change the system very drastically, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just the energy consumption.</p>
<p>But the fact that we exchange ideas is,</p>
<p>part of who I am is everyone I&rsquo;ve interacted with.</p>
<p>And of course, the people I interact more with</p>
<p>have sculpted me more,</p>
<p>but our brains are sculpted through our interactions</p>
<p>with each other as well.</p>
<p>Yes, but I wonder if it&rsquo;s a more correct</p>
<p>and useful perspective to take</p>
<p>that those interactions are the organisms.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still making the brain the primary.</p>
<p>There could be like,</p>
<p>that the brain is what it is</p>
<p>because of the social interactions,</p>
<p>and the social interactions are the living organism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird perspective</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much more profound.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually think it&rsquo;s one or the other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both living.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a little bit like,</p>
<p>I have two children,</p>
<p>and a lot of people with two children will say,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re preparing to have the second one,</p>
<p>and soon after you&rsquo;ve had the second one,</p>
<p>that having two is kind of like having three</p>
<p>because you are nourishing and protecting</p>
<p>and overseeing each individual life,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the sibling relationship,</p>
<p>which is almost another thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken with Don Hoffman a few times.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In his book, Case Against Reality.</p>
<p>Many more than a few, yeah.</p>
<p>Many more than a few.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fun ones.</p>
<p>Was there one where Sam was involved?</p>
<p>Well, Sam and I interviewed him.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>Most of the conversations I&rsquo;ve had with him are private.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not public, but we used to meet.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic,</p>
<p>we were meeting about monthly to discuss ideas.</p>
<p>I would love to be a fly on the wall of those discussions,</p>
<p>but he wrote a book, Case Against Reality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He says, in the case that our perception</p>
<p>is completely detached from objective reality,</p>
<p>can you explain his perspective and let us know?</p>
<p>Well, no, no, maybe not fully,</p>
<p>but to which degree you agree and don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So this is much more focused.</p>
<p>I guess you guys have an agreement</p>
<p>that consciousness is somehow fundamental.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think we both think we might be wrong.</p>
<p>About the consciousness or about reality?</p>
<p>About it being fundamental.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re both just,</p>
<p>we both agree that this is a legitimate question to ask</p>
<p>at this point in science.</p>
<p>Is consciousness fundamental?</p>
<p>And I really see it as a question,</p>
<p>and I think he does too.</p>
<p>But he goes hard on reality.</p>
<p>Yes, and it&rsquo;s interesting because I, you know,</p>
<p>especially, so I actually now have recorded</p>
<p>three conversations with him</p>
<p>for this project I&rsquo;m working on, yeah.</p>
<p>And in every conversation we have,</p>
<p>we seem to land on the same place,</p>
<p>but this last conversation we had,</p>
<p>it seemed to be even more clear</p>
<p>that the semantics really get in the way.</p>
<p>When you get into the weeds in these conversations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like we need some new terminology</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to know sometimes</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>I have issues with his terminology</p>
<p>that when we talk about what his terminology represents,</p>
<p>it seems like we completely agree.</p>
<p>But the conclusions you don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible we have a very similar view of the universe</p>
<p>if consciousness is fundamental.</p>
<p>It may be an identical view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to know</p>
<p>because I disagree with a lot of his terminology.</p>
<p>Okay, but our four-dimensional reality,</p>
<p>he says that&rsquo;s like a complete space-time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete weird construction that-</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, the truth is that,</p>
<p>I mean, if you talk to a neuroscientist like Anil Seth,</p>
<p>and I would say most neuroscientists,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s really good on this subject,</p>
<p>and his expertise and his area of focus is in perception,</p>
<p>so he talks a lot about how our perceptions</p>
<p>give us an experience of the world,</p>
<p>and he calls it a controlled hallucination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, he probably got,</p>
<p>I think he says that he got that term from someone else,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the term he uses.</p>
<p>We got every term from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Everything, there&rsquo;s no new ideas.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which what Hoffman is saying</p>
<p>is already, we already know to be the case.</p>
<p>So our brains are creating this conscious experience</p>
<p>based on these interactions with the outside world.</p>
<p>It is, in some sense, all a controlled hallucination.</p>
<p>And someone like Anil Seth,</p>
<p>so from the neuroscientific point of view,</p>
<p>I actually have a quote here somewhere</p>
<p>if you have any interest in hearing the quote,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s essentially saying</p>
<p>everything we experience is a perception,</p>
<p>including our experience of time and space.</p>
<p>So we still don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what our experience of space represents</p>
<p>out there in the world.</p>
<p>And then, of course, when you talk to physicists</p>
<p>about the different interpretations of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>I mean, where physics seems to be headed</p>
<p>across the board at this point</p>
<p>is that space and time are emergent,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not part of the fundamental fabric of reality.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some ways in which</p>
<p>Don is saying things that.</p>
<p>Is he being too poetic about it?</p>
<p>Is that the right way to phrase it?</p>
<p>Because like.</p>
<p>No, go ahead.</p>
<p>He says like, it&rsquo;s not that our perception</p>
<p>is just a controlled hallucination.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying something more than that.</p>
<p>More than that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, yes.</p>
<p>But my point is that a lot of what he&rsquo;s already saying,</p>
<p>on some level, science is already there</p>
<p>and could agree with.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not all the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying like.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>That we don&rsquo;t even, we&rsquo;ve like,</p>
<p>the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Has constructed our brain mechanisms in such a way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really far from having access</p>
<p>to objective reality.</p>
<p>Yes, although I think we already know that as well.</p>
<p>I mean, if any version of string theory is correct,</p>
<p>and you know, of course, we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all up for grabs,</p>
<p>but the truth is each theory is weirder than the last.</p>
<p>If there are 15 dimensions of space,</p>
<p>we are just not,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not wired to be able to understand</p>
<p>the fundamental reality.</p>
<p>But I think we have a consistent abstraction</p>
<p>that seems to be reliable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like a blockchain.</p>
<p>Yes, and he&rsquo;s not just saying</p>
<p>that we really only have this tiny window onto reality.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying that that window onto reality</p>
<p>is giving us a lot of false information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an abstraction, it&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s saying there&rsquo;s no reason it needs to be true.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not required to be true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s, through natural selection,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible to imagine,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s likely to imagine that organisms</p>
<p>will evolve in such a way that you&rsquo;re going to just</p>
<p>be lying to yourself completely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the question there is, if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really interesting thing to think about.</p>
<p>I think the regular way in which he approaches it</p>
<p>is really admirable.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think it&rsquo;s scientific.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the question for me is,</p>
<p>why is it so consistent across all of these organisms?</p>
<p>We all seem to see the table.</p>
<p>Like, and feel, and run into the table.</p>
<p>So what he will agree, so what I would say to that,</p>
<p>and when I pose this to him,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t want to speak for him,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll answer it myself and say that I believe he agrees</p>
<p>with what I&rsquo;m about to say,</p>
<p>which is that the things we perceive</p>
<p>are connected to the structure of reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the structure of reality</p>
<p>is made of something completely different</p>
<p>than the thing we&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>So imagine, if you just go with the holographic principle,</p>
<p>you know, loosely, and actually,</p>
<p>the holographic principle applies to black holes only.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ADS-CFT duality, anti-de Sitter space,</p>
<p>and conformal field theory.</p>
<p>Am I getting all these terms right?</p>
<p>The terms are right, but I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going there.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, this is where I&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>in all of my conversations with physicists,</p>
<p>because the idea is,</p>
<p>so if we just have the basic principle</p>
<p>that reality and all of the information can be contained,</p>
<p>or is actually in a two-dimensional space</p>
<p>that gets projected, this is something that you don&rsquo;t buy,</p>
<p>based on the look on your face.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m actually freaking out,</p>
<p>because yes, any theory of modern physics</p>
<p>gives inkling that reality&rsquo;s very weird.</p>
<p>Right, and completely different from how we experience it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>So this is an intuition that, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>has always felt true to me.</p>
<p>This is the way I thought about things as a child.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met other people that felt this way</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve had experiences in psychedelics,</p>
<p>and this is where I start to sound crazy, too.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Everybody else is crazy, except us.</p>
<p>But that has always seemed right to me,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s always the thing</p>
<p>that I feel like I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, recently I was thinking</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s as if I feel like I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>and this is more how,</p>
<p>I was thinking of how I felt as a child,</p>
<p>but I feel this way a lot as an adult, too,</p>
<p>that the image is one of a snow globe,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m confined to this snow globe</p>
<p>based on my human perceptions,</p>
<p>and the truth of reality is out there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually why I&rsquo;m so drawn to shaking intuitions.</p>
<p>I feel like every time we shake up an intuition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an opportunity to leave the snow globe</p>
<p>for a moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like smashing the marbles and seeing,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s not liquid in there like I thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting this glimpse of something truer</p>
<p>than what we typically experience.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s for a long time gonna be snow globes</p>
<p>inside snow globes, inside snow globes.</p>
<p>But the larger point is that, yes,</p>
<p>whatever is true about the fundamental nature of reality</p>
<p>is not something we&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>However, it is linked and gives us clues to it.</p>
<p>So one image I came up with recently,</p>
<p>I actually wrote about this.</p>
<p>I have an article in Nautilus about time,</p>
<p>because I was, as I spend time thinking about</p>
<p>what it would mean for consciousness to be fundamental,</p>
<p>and at the same time, I&rsquo;m talking to physicists</p>
<p>about different interpretations of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and the fact that the ones I&rsquo;m talking to</p>
<p>believe that space and time are emergent</p>
<p>and are not part of the fundamental story.</p>
<p>I was thinking about what is it,</p>
<p>what could time be if it&rsquo;s not the way we experience it?</p>
<p>What could it be pointing to?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not the first person to think like this.</p>
<p>Many people have developed different thought experiments</p>
<p>around this, but, and this is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is the way things are,</p>
<p>but this is just one solution is that time and causality</p>
<p>appear to us the way they do,</p>
<p>because for whatever reason,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only perceiving one moment at a time.</p>
<p>And these connections between events</p>
<p>that we perceive as time are actually</p>
<p>just part of the fabric of reality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some structure to reality at a deeper level,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like shining a flashlight</p>
<p>on the structure of reality,</p>
<p>where for us, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>everything else disappears.</p>
<p>And the only thing that exists is that single pinprick</p>
<p>of light that we happen to be inhabiting</p>
<p>or that we can perceive, but the rest of it is there.</p>
<p>And so that even though time would be an illusion</p>
<p>and the causality in the way we experience it,</p>
<p>it is an illusion,</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t mean what we think it means,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still pointing to a deeper structure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that it corresponds to</p>
<p>in the fundamental nature of reality.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had enough conversations with Don, I think,</p>
<p>to know that he would agree with that,</p>
<p>that our perceptions map onto something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not the experience of it that we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>So to go back to the idea that all of us</p>
<p>all of reality could be contained in two dimensions,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something about the interaction</p>
<p>between different points that cause this holograph,</p>
<p>so that it seems like there&rsquo;s a three-dimensional world</p>
<p>when in fact it&rsquo;s a projection</p>
<p>of this two-dimensional surface.</p>
<p>What we experience as space still references something</p>
<p>at the fundamental level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s not space.</p>
<p>And that is something that makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>I also, I posted an excerpt,</p>
<p>George Musser wrote a great book,</p>
<p>Spooky Action at a Distance, Spooky Action at a Distance.</p>
<p>And he talks about, he&rsquo;s a great science writer,</p>
<p>and he talks about ways to kind of absorb</p>
<p>what this would mean,</p>
<p>this ADS-CFT duality.</p>
<p>And he talks about, he gives an example of music</p>
<p>as an analogy, that two different notes can exist</p>
<p>in three dimensions as if the other doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>because of the frequency of the sound waves.</p>
<p>And that in another way, you can think of the sound waves</p>
<p>existing in different dimensions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak as well as I write, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this in a way</p>
<p>that I think is easier to absorb</p>
<p>than the way I just described it.</p>
<p>But I think causality is the trickiest one,</p>
<p>trickier one.</p>
<p>Time is a tricky one to like,</p>
<p>who, boy.</p>
<p>And there are physicists who think that space is emergent</p>
<p>but time is still fundamental.</p>
<p>And Lee Smolin is one of those scientists.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really interesting to talk to him about this.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>Time being emergent</p>
<p>is a really trippy one to think about.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>at which point does the experience of time</p>
<p>start becoming a part of the conscious experience</p>
<p>of living organisms?</p>
<p>So is it something that evolved on Earth?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Only?</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very hard to think about consciousness</p>
<p>without time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>for me to think about, too.</p>
<p>Although, not that this is scientific evidence of anything,</p>
<p>but I and many others have had the experience,</p>
<p>a timeless, spaceless experience</p>
<p>in certain states of meditation</p>
<p>and under the influence of psychedelics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still a conscious experience, would you say?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>But didn&rsquo;t you say that some aspect</p>
<p>of conscious experience is memory?</p>
<p>It seems like that, too.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I said an experience of being a self is due to memory.</p>
<p>It seems that consciousness and time</p>
<p>are inextricably linked,</p>
<p>but I think that may be an illusion also.</p>
<p>And when I think about consciousness being fundamental,</p>
<p>and someone like Max Tegmark,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there are other mathematicians,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are, he&rsquo;s the only one I know of</p>
<p>who will talk about mathematical forms and shapes</p>
<p>as not just being, he talks about them</p>
<p>as being actual objects in nature that exist,</p>
<p>that are not just mathematical structures</p>
<p>that we can think about,</p>
<p>but any mathematical structure that comes out of the math</p>
<p>actually exists in reality.</p>
<p>And so, when I think about consciousness being fundamental,</p>
<p>I think about physics and mathematics</p>
<p>being a description of the structure of it.</p>
<p>And that when mathematicians say things like that,</p>
<p>or physicists say things like that,</p>
<p>it makes sense if we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a conscious experience of some sort.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>First of all, Max is great.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, this is really interesting to think about</p>
<p>like how, what is fundamental.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good exercise to do in general.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like to truly think through it.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, it&rsquo;s a very humbling process</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re probably in the very early days of,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t know currently, right?</p>
<p>Right, currently.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe permanently, but I remain optimistic.</p>
<p>Right, well, to jump around a little bit,</p>
<p>the Google AI engineer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the terms from the press, it&rsquo;s kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>But like-</p>
<p>Why, is this a friend of yours?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not, no, no.</p>
<p>But just, you know, the term AI is really not used</p>
<p>amongst machine learning people.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, okay.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m using kind of Google AI engineer</p>
<p>and this is like sentience and chatbot</p>
<p>and like none of those words are really used</p>
<p>by the people that actually build them.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re much more likely to use language model</p>
<p>versus chatbot or like natural language dialogue</p>
<p>versus chatbot or whatever.</p>
<p>And certainly not sentience.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes the difference between</p>
<p>the public discourse and the engineering</p>
<p>is actually really important</p>
<p>because engineering tends to want to ignore the magic.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t notice the magic.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Google AI engineer believes</p>
<p>that the Lambda One language,</p>
<p>natural language system achieved sentience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you paid attention to that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But the general question is, do you think a chatbot,</p>
<p>do you think a robot could be conscious?</p>
<p>So, I mean, this answer is slightly different</p>
<p>or very different depending on whether</p>
<p>I kind of follow the assumption that consciousness emerges</p>
<p>at some point in physical processing</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s fundamental.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve just chosen to stay on the fundamental channel,</p>
<p>I mean, then it&rsquo;s kind of a silly answer</p>
<p>because if consciousness is fundamental</p>
<p>in the way I currently think about it,</p>
<p>the only way I imagine it working,</p>
<p>every physical thing we perceive</p>
<p>is a representation of a conscious experience.</p>
<p>So, I mean, yes, it&rsquo;s true of everything in the world.</p>
<p>However, I would say if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s a way in which it&rsquo;s behaving</p>
<p>in similar ways to a human being,</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s constructed, what it is actually made of</p>
<p>and the physics of it is so different</p>
<p>that I would expect it to have an entirely,</p>
<p>completely non-human conscious experience.</p>
<p>And whether it even feels like a self,</p>
<p>I think would be a big question mark.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s questions of ethics and&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it capable of suffering?</p>
<p>Is suffering connected to&hellip;</p>
<p>Consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness or&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, obviously it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only way you can suffer is in a conscious way.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not, maybe it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s more connected to self than consciousness.</p>
<p>I would say, I mean, just on my own use of these words,</p>
<p>suffering is only something that can happen</p>
<p>in a conscious experience.</p>
<p>Right, so can robots suffer?</p>
<p>If they have a&hellip;</p>
<p>Anything that has a conscious experience</p>
<p>can experience suffering, yes.</p>
<p>But do plants suffer in the same?</p>
<p>So is there some level where when we construct</p>
<p>our morals and ethics that&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there a class of conscious experiences</p>
<p>or organisms that are capable of conscious experience</p>
<p>that we can anthropomorphize sufficiently</p>
<p>such that we give them rights?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is not an area that&hellip;</p>
<p>I have spent, for me,</p>
<p>I have not spent a lot of time thinking about this.</p>
<p>Most people expect that I have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>These types of questions are much less interesting to me</p>
<p>than the other questions.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in the physics of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat interested, I&rsquo;m definitely interested</p>
<p>in ethical questions for human beings,</p>
<p>but I have spent very little time thinking</p>
<p>about the implications for other types of intelligence.</p>
<p>I will say that I think the capacity for suffering</p>
<p>of a conscious system goes up with memory</p>
<p>and with a sense of self.</p>
<p>So if you take&hellip;</p>
<p>If anesthesia only erased your memory</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t actually make you unconscious,</p>
<p>you actually experienced,</p>
<p>horrifically experienced some surgical procedure,</p>
<p>but we could completely wipe out your memory of it,</p>
<p>as nightmarish as that scenario is,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not suggesting we should ever do this,</p>
<p>I would say if our only option</p>
<p>were to erase your memory of it,</p>
<p>that would be the more ethical thing to do</p>
<p>than to have you maintain that memory</p>
<p>because the suffering is then carried</p>
<p>across a longer distance through time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s presuming that suffering is unethical.</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that what ethics is all about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, to me,</p>
<p>ethics is all about suffering and well-being,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what ethics is without that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different measures of suffering,</p>
<p>so having one traumatic event may,</p>
<p>if you erase that one traumatic event,</p>
<p>that potentially might have negative,</p>
<p>unmet consequences for the growth of a human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, so then it&rsquo;s a different question,</p>
<p>but I would say that memory increases suffering globally</p>
<p>so that if any moment of suffering</p>
<p>only existed for itself in the present moment,</p>
<p>that is a lesser kind of suffering</p>
<p>than a suffering that is drawn out over time through memory.</p>
<p>So hard to think about, yeah.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I mean, in terms of AI,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re conscious and there&rsquo;s a sense of self and memory,</p>
<p>which I actually think you need memory</p>
<p>to have a sense of self.</p>
<p>Actually, sorry, I take that back.</p>
<p>I actually think you can have</p>
<p>a really primitive sense of self without memory.</p>
<p>But an AI that is conscious,</p>
<p>that has memory and a sense of self,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s capable of suffering, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things,</p>
<p>because you said you haven&rsquo;t really looked into this area</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many interesting things to look into,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really focused on the physics side.</p>
<p>To me, the neuroscience experiments that you mentioned</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a difference between the timing of things</p>
<p>that kind of reveal there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>To me, working with robots,</p>
<p>I have little robots that are moving around my home</p>
<p>in Austin, it&rsquo;s a very good embodied thought experiment.</p>
<p>Like, here&rsquo;s a thing that looks like it has a free will.</p>
<p>It looks like it has conscious experiences.</p>
<p>And then I know how it&rsquo;s programmed.</p>
<p>And so, like, I have to go back and forth</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, this is what I do.</p>
<p>You lay on the ground looking up at the stars</p>
<p>thinking about plants, and I look at a robot like.</p>
<p>Well, you can do this with plants too.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some complex enough behavior</p>
<p>that looks like free will from a certain angle.</p>
<p>And it makes you wonder two things.</p>
<p>One, is there consciousness associated with that processing?</p>
<p>And two, if there isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>what does that say about our experience?</p>
<p>And our circumstance in nature, what does that say?</p>
<p>Yeah, but yeah, I do that with plants all the time.</p>
<p>I go back and forth.</p>
<p>But the zombie thought experiment now,</p>
<p>at least for me, is often presented as AI</p>
<p>because now that&rsquo;s easier, as a robot,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s easier, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in pop culture now</p>
<p>in the form of films and television shows.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s easier to get to that point of contemplation,</p>
<p>I think, by imagining a robot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why exactly I&rsquo;m bothered</p>
<p>by philosophers talking about zombies</p>
<p>because it feels like they&rsquo;re missing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reducing a joyful experience.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like talking about,</p>
<p>listen, when you fall in love with somebody,</p>
<p>the other person is a zombie.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re conscious or not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just making presumptions and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it says philosophers will do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>They might as well be a zombie.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s no such thing as love,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a mutual, like economists will reduce love</p>
<p>to some kind of mutual calculation</p>
<p>that minimizes risk and stability over time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, what I wanna do</p>
<p>with each of those people is I wanna take,</p>
<p>I wanna find every one of those philosophers</p>
<p>that talk about zombies and eventually give them</p>
<p>one of those robots and watch them fall in love</p>
<p>and see how their understanding of how humble they are</p>
<p>by how little we understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point of the zombie experiment.</p>
<p>I mean, the zombie thought experiment.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t speak for any of them.</p>
<p>Empathy for zombies, is that the point?</p>
<p>No, so for me, I mean, I don&rsquo;t like spending</p>
<p>much time on it.</p>
<p>I think it has limited use for sure.</p>
<p>And I understand your annoyance with it.</p>
<p>But for me, what&rsquo;s so useful about it is</p>
<p>it gets you to ask the same questions you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at robots.</p>
<p>If you just run the experiment and you say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m sitting here with Lex.</p>
<p>What if I try to trick myself?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s different about the world</p>
<p>if someone tells me actually he&rsquo;s a robot?</p>
<p>Is essentially what the zombie experiment is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s over there.</p>
<p>He has no conscious experience.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s acting all serious, but there&rsquo;s no experience there.</p>
<p>So it gets you to ask some interesting questions.</p>
<p>One is, okay, when it seems impossible,</p>
<p>I just think, no, that makes no sense.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine that.</p>
<p>Okay, what do I think consciousness is responsible for?</p>
<p>What is consciousness doing in that human over there</p>
<p>that is Lex that I can&rsquo;t fathom all of your behavior</p>
<p>and everything that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and about without consciousness?</p>
<p>So it gets you to ask this question.</p>
<p>These are the questions I begin my book with.</p>
<p>What is consciousness doing?</p>
<p>It gets you to ask that question in a deeper way.</p>
<p>And then I kind of found this alternate,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if other people have done this,</p>
<p>but I found this alternate use for it,</p>
<p>which is even more useful to me,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;m able to do it sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to just sit with someone</p>
<p>and get my imagination going</p>
<p>and imagine there really is no conscious experience there</p>
<p>in that person.</p>
<p>And what happened for me the first few times</p>
<p>I was able to do this is it reminded me exactly</p>
<p>of how I feel when I look at complex plant behavior</p>
<p>and other behaviors in nature</p>
<p>where I assume there&rsquo;s no conscious experience.</p>
<p>And to me, it just flips everything on its head.</p>
<p>It just gets you to be able,</p>
<p>it gets you to be open to possibilities</p>
<p>that you were closed to before.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Does it enhance or dissipate your capacity</p>
<p>for love of other human beings?</p>
<p>What role does love play in the human condition, Aga?</p>
<p>I mean, in so many ways, it&rsquo;s the most important role.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of these realizations,</p>
<p>I mean, if anything, I think it enhances it.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they,</p>
<p>I mean, it kind of goes back to the levels of usefulness.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to picture your friends as a plant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to appreciate the beauty</p>
<p>that they are as an organism.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>For me, the more time I spend practicing meditation,</p>
<p>seeing through these illusions,</p>
<p>the more poignant my conscious experience becomes.</p>
<p>And love is obviously one of the most powerful</p>
<p>and one of the most positive experiences we have.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>whatever its cause is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just something miraculous about it</p>
<p>in and of itself and for itself.</p>
<p>I think love, romantic love, is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Connection, friendship is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so interesting how people can grow together,</p>
<p>how they interact together,</p>
<p>disagree together and make each other better.</p>
<p>Like, scientific collaborations are like this, too.</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman, Tversky, I mean, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and most people are not able to do that</p>
<p>in the scientific realm.</p>
<p>They create, the more successful you become,</p>
<p>the more solid they become.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s rare, and you recognize it when you have it,</p>
<p>when you have a great collaboration,</p>
<p>I mean, in science, but also in other areas.</p>
<p>In this TED production I&rsquo;m working on,</p>
<p>I just happened to be working with this producer</p>
<p>where we had this instant connection</p>
<p>and the chemistry&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>and I have so much fun recording with her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so great to have, I usually work alone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been wonderful to have her as a partner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a chat, it&rsquo;s like a conversation type of thing?</p>
<p>Yes, she&rsquo;s taking my conversation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re playing around with it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just working on the pilot, so it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I love how you have no idea how it&rsquo;s gonna turn out.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I just started working</p>
<p>without a clear image of the end result,</p>
<p>although it started with an idea for a film.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I guess I have a feeling,</p>
<p>I was just wondering if I&rsquo;d talked about this</p>
<p>with you before anywhere, but probably not.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you and I have never spoken before.</p>
<p>No, we just met, we just know each other.</p>
<p>You mean you didn&rsquo;t see me</p>
<p>when I was listening to that podcast of yours?</p>
<p>And had that thought, you didn&rsquo;t hear that thought?</p>
<p>I mean, we were mentioning this offline as a small tangent,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cool dynamic in how we get to become</p>
<p>really close friends without never having met,</p>
<p>never having talked one way,</p>
<p>but it could be one-way friendships that form</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know, that makes me feel</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re all connected</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re almost like plugging into some kind of weird</p>
<p>thing in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>So many things I wanna say now,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s one thing is the way I think about consciousness,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s fundamental, is analogous to a pot of boiling water</p>
<p>where the water is the consciousness</p>
<p>and the bubbles are the conscious experiences.</p>
<p>And so it is all one thing</p>
<p>and then there are these shapes that take form</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a felt experience, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all felt experience.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re able to let go of this sense of self</p>
<p>or this illusion of self,</p>
<p>the idea that experiences are happening to something</p>
<p>or to someone drops out</p>
<p>and what you get is just experiences arising.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the fundamental nature of the universe,</p>
<p>which obviously has a structure and obeys laws,</p>
<p>but what you get out of that</p>
<p>are appearances of different conscious experiences.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just coming into being, right?</p>
<p>And so there is under that view,</p>
<p>I mean, there are different ways</p>
<p>to look at the fundamental nature of reality</p>
<p>without consciousness and kind of come up</p>
<p>with a similar view,</p>
<p>but in that view, it is just kind of one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing with different experiences popping up.</p>
<p>And in that boiling pot is a lobster,</p>
<p>which represents the human condition.</p>
<p>The devil.</p>
<p>Because life is suffering.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve read the statement</p>
<p>of Pastor Wallace, consider the lobster.</p>
<p>I mean, the stuff that we do to lobsters</p>
<p>is fascinatingly horrible.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Oh yeah, no, I mean, that was my first rejection</p>
<p>of many worlds, just my psychological rejection of it</p>
<p>was just imagining the multiplication</p>
<p>of all the suffering.</p>
<p>I just, I mean, I spend a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about, consumed by,</p>
<p>and trying not to be overwhelmed</p>
<p>by the depth of human suffering.</p>
<p>To imagine many worlds with is just-</p>
<p>Infinite suffering?</p>
<p>Oh my God, yeah.</p>
<p>What is it about humans?</p>
<p>I think you spent too much time on Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s focused on the suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s also the awesomeness.</p>
<p>And I think the awesomeness outpowers</p>
<p>the suffering over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p>I wish I believed that.</p>
<p>With memory, as you said, the suffering is multiplied.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought.</p>
<p>But with memory,</p>
<p>beauty is multiplied as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Yes, where I stand with it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m, for some reason, still optimistic</p>
<p>that we can get ourselves to a different place.</p>
<p>But the way things currently are,</p>
<p>or the way things have always been for animals and humans,</p>
<p>and I think any conscious life form is,</p>
<p>to me, the suffering seems so much more impactful</p>
<p>and powerful than any happy,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word, experience,</p>
<p>that no happy experience is worth</p>
<p>its equivalent experience of suffering.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s certainly how I feel as well.</p>
<p>But I have learned not to trust my feelings.</p>
<p>Yeah, well.</p>
<p>So the folks who are religious will ask the question,</p>
<p>which I think applies whether you&rsquo;re religious or not,</p>
<p>why is there suffering in the world?</p>
<p>Why does a just God allow suffering?</p>
<p>Those kinds of questions.</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>it does seem that suffering is a deep part of human history.</p>
<p>And you have to really think about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of nature.</p>
<p>It means-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of nature.</p>
<p>If feeling good is surviving and thriving,</p>
<p>nothing survives and thrives forever.</p>
<p>So you just encounter suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just built in.</p>
<p>Yeah, death meets us all in the end.</p>
<p>And only,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hilarious to then think about</p>
<p>the most of nature and the cruelty</p>
<p>and the poverty of nature,</p>
<p>like how horrible the conditions are for animals.</p>
<p>And plants.</p>
<p>And plants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just war all over the place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s war, but it&rsquo;s mostly, yeah, it&rsquo;s war,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just, it&rsquo;s like poverty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extreme poverty.</p>
<p>When people criticize farms and so on,</p>
<p>you also have to consider the suffering that animals,</p>
<p>we try to imagine that animals in the woods</p>
<p>are all this happy time.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like, you have to really consider</p>
<p>if you really asked an animal,</p>
<p>would they like to sit in a boring zoo</p>
<p>and be fed away from the wild</p>
<p>and nature and the freedom and so on?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of them would choose the zoo</p>
<p>versus nature.</p>
<p>Anyway, but what&rsquo;s the meaning of life, Anika?</p>
<p>Let me ask the question.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the question for whatever you&rsquo;re plugged into.</p>
<p>Is that a question for the body and mind system</p>
<p>we call Anika?</p>
<p>Call Anika and let&rsquo;s see what that.</p>
<p>The meaning of life?</p>
<p>Yeah, the why, the why.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Is there a why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been drawn to the why questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the what and the how.</p>
<p>What is life?</p>
<p>What is this place?</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>How are we here?</p>
<p>How is this taking place?</p>
<p>But I mean, if I had to answer,</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t think there is a why really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, the quote,</p>
<p>the thought that comes to mind is really</p>
<p>like a kind of a cheesy quote that I&rsquo;m sure is printed</p>
<p>on a bunch of mugs and t-shirts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s Thich Nhat Hanh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get it wrong,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something like we&rsquo;re here to awaken</p>
<p>from our illusion of separateness.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t really see that as an answer</p>
<p>to the why question,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s framed in his quote.</p>
<p>We are here for that purpose.</p>
<p>I think if there is a purpose worth being here for,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of the ultimate, I think.</p>
<p>Let me ask you for advice.</p>
<p>You had a complex and a beautiful journey through life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exceptionally successful.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young folks</p>
<p>in high school or in college</p>
<p>about how to live a life like yours</p>
<p>or how to live a life they can be proud of</p>
<p>or have a career they can be proud of?</p>
<p>How to pave a path and journey</p>
<p>they can be happy with and be proud of?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really had this conversation with my kids.</p>
<p>I mean, we have lots of deep conversations</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all so deep.</p>
<p>Lots of deep conversations</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all kind of pertaining to each moment</p>
<p>or whatever they&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>I think career is difficult</p>
<p>because in so many ways I just feel like I&rsquo;m lucky</p>
<p>that I ended up being able to do for a living</p>
<p>the thing I love to do.</p>
<p>But the truth is-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as luck.</p>
<p>Yeah, well-</p>
<p>Or the free will.</p>
<p>Luck is an illusion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as luck</p>
<p>when you believe in free will, right?</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all illusions.</p>
<p>I really start, in retrospect,</p>
<p>started working on my book 30 years ago</p>
<p>and had no idea that I was working on a book.</p>
<p>And this kind of ties into my advice,</p>
<p>which is I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to follow your passion</p>
<p>and to find things that you love</p>
<p>and that you find inspiring and motivating and exciting,</p>
<p>whether they relate to your career or not.</p>
<p>And I think many times,</p>
<p>if you persist just for the pure passion</p>
<p>of the thing itself,</p>
<p>it finds a way into your everyday life.</p>
<p>The career manifests itself.</p>
<p>Out of whatever pursuit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had such an unconventional path.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for me to give advice based on that path.</p>
<p>But I do believe that it&rsquo;s extraordinarily important</p>
<p>to keep your passions alive,</p>
<p>to keep your curiosity alive,</p>
<p>to keep your wonder at life alive,</p>
<p>however you do that.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be in your career.</p>
<p>And I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>their career enables them the time and the space</p>
<p>to experience other things</p>
<p>that maybe wouldn&rsquo;t be as enjoyable</p>
<p>if they were at their career.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, in general,</p>
<p>a dogged pursuit of the stuff you love</p>
<p>will create something beautiful.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s an unconventional path,</p>
<p>those are the best kind.</p>
<p>Those are the most beautiful kind.</p>
<p>And it created, in this case,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a beautiful person, Anika,</p>
<p>you have a beautiful mind.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for doing everything you do</p>
<p>and for sharing it with the world.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for talking with me today.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>Good to finally meet you.</p>
<p>Great to finally meet you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Anika Harris.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>I will not let anyone walk through my mind</p>
<p>with their dirty feet.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening,</p>
<p>and hope to see you next time.</p>
