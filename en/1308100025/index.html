    <p>We have a special guest today, backed by popular demand, great hair, cologne abuser, father</p>
<p>of my two shining angels, Josh Welch.</p>
<p>Hello, hello, hello, ladies.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Have you been missing us?</p>
<p>Missing, missing.</p>
<p>I mean, after my last performance, I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s been this long.</p>
<p>I am interested that you called it a performance.</p>
<p>Well, I just follow the numbers.</p>
<p>The numbers don&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that my last guest appearance was the most listened to</p>
<p>episode of I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>At the time.</p>
<p>At the time.</p>
<p>At the time.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>At the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re trending in the right direction, but how we start these things off</p>
<p>is pumps.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you tell me what you&rsquo;ve had it with?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with is my Apple Watch constantly telling me to stand up.</p>
<p>Bossing you around.</p>
<p>No, those things are bossing.</p>
<p>It bosses me around all the time.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my I&rsquo;ve Had It part of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind the bossing if it&rsquo;s a reminder, but if I&rsquo;m in a situation I can&rsquo;t stand up,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t say, hey, judge, zip it.</p>
<p>I need a minute to walk around in the courtroom because I need to stand for my Apple Watch.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to do that.</p>
<p>Or if I&rsquo;m doing this, I can&rsquo;t stand up and, you know, walk around.</p>
<p>Then it docks you for the whole day.</p>
<p>And your rings don&rsquo;t close.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re punished.</p>
<p>So I got a thing last night that said I&rsquo;d only closed my ring seven times in January.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>And I look in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fucking stand one.</p>
<p>No, it trolls you to tell you what a loser you are.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not exercising enough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine because it is a good reminder.</p>
<p>But the standing to dock you, so you&rsquo;re like completely don&rsquo;t close your rings and then</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get one of those stupid awards that every time I get one of those stupid awards,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re stupid.</p>
<p>Then when I don&rsquo;t get it, I get mad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to act uninterested, but this doesn&rsquo;t appear to be about me.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>How can we?</p>
<p>I am the guest here.</p>
<p>I am the guest.</p>
<p>I have an I&rsquo;ve Had It and it involves you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with when you live with people and as the listener knows, and as everybody</p>
<p>in this room knows, we do live together and you have certain drawers that you keep certain</p>
<p>items.</p>
<p>For example, in our silverware drawer, we used to keep two pair of scissors back there,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>One pair of scissors went AWOL, right?</p>
<p>And most recently a second pair of scissors went AWOL.</p>
<p>I always return the items to the spot and I&rsquo;ve had it with going to a place where you</p>
<p>know you vigilantly put something.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m diligent about putting the scissors in the spot and they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>And so Josh, what do you have to say about that?</p>
<p>I think one pair is in there.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just, and it was around Christmas time when you were wrapping.</p>
<p>I have a separate set of scissors for those that I keep in a different drawer.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s probably my fault then, that&rsquo;s what I need to be saying here.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my fault.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you for that confession and apology.</p>
<p>Scissors do walk off though.</p>
<p>They absolutely do.</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, mine do at my house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have like eight in a drawer and then there&rsquo;s none.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t walk off.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, somebody walks away with them, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just Luke and I, the scissors are always there.</p>
<p>Not blaming the other two outright, but it seems they go missing more when the older</p>
<p>two are at home.</p>
<p>Josh, what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny that you should ask because it applies directly to both of your I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve had it with are people that can&rsquo;t read the room, that don&rsquo;t get it, that share</p>
<p>something that maybe is not relevant, helpful, interesting, and the listener doesn&rsquo;t enjoy</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve all been in those situations where you have someone sharing something and the</p>
<p>story goes on and it goes on and it goes on.</p>
<p>The phone comes out, there&rsquo;s illustrations, there&rsquo;s photographs, and there&rsquo;s no way that</p>
<p>that person could reasonably think that the other person is remotely interested unless</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just tone deaf, unless they&rsquo;re completely, and it happens all the time.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a-</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s epidemic.</p>
<p>It is an epidemic.</p>
<p>And it reminds me of that scene in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.</p>
<p>Remember that comedy from the 80s with Steve Martin, John Candy, and I think Steve Martin</p>
<p>looks at John Candy and he says, I have an idea for you.</p>
<p>When you go and start to tell a story, the story needs to have a point.</p>
<p>He said it makes it that much more enjoyable for the listener if you can do that.</p>
<p>So my I&rsquo;ve had it is going to apply to lots of people that I come into contact with that</p>
<p>just simply don&rsquo;t understand that I&rsquo;m not that interested in their story.</p>
<p>But to be fair, if the story&rsquo;s not about you, you&rsquo;re just not going to be interested.</p>
<p>I can fake interest if it&rsquo;s not about me.</p>
<p>But when they start talking about people that they know that I don&rsquo;t know, and they only</p>
<p>mention them by first name as if I know them, there&rsquo;s just no appreciation for the fact</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know anything about this, nor do I care.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my biggest fear is that as I grow old with Jennifer, that I go and start telling</p>
<p>stories like that and people behind my back are saying, God damn, that last 10 minutes</p>
<p>with Josh was the roughest shit I&rsquo;ve had in a while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting you should say that, because I&rsquo;ve noticed like when we go on dog walk,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re out and about, and we see a couple that I have zero interest talking to, and</p>
<p>I know that you have zero interest in talking to.</p>
<p>And you will immediately bring up football or some bullshit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m standing there trying to walk away, and you&rsquo;ve even pointed it out, like you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even try to feign interest.</p>
<p>You just immediately kind of turned.</p>
<p>I was like, I did not want to be involved in that conversation.</p>
<p>So I think that you, and I&rsquo;ve been, I&rsquo;ve fallen prey to it multiple times where you&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of this dad humor, like, well, what about OU&rsquo;s game?</p>
<p>What do you think they&rsquo;re going to do with that coach?</p>
<p>You think they&rsquo;re going to fire him?</p>
<p>And I mean, you do engage in a little bit of this dad, quirky humor stuff from time</p>
<p>to time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Well, let me just say this.</p>
<p>You know, you have to, we live in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>So you have to be okay to a certain extent with small talk, with banter.</p>
<p>And I wish that we were in LA and I could ask him some cool California question.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it&rsquo;s just, how are the Sooners doing?</p>
<p>Do you see the Cowboys game?</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>Going out to Lake Hefner this evening.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re stuck with here.</p>
<p>I do think this is a big problem because Angie, if you&rsquo;ll remember when your friend came in</p>
<p>town from Atlanta and we went to that Italian restaurant and right as our food gets dropped</p>
<p>at the table and I&rsquo;m starving, I&rsquo;m like, want to gnaw my arm off out of hunger, starving.</p>
<p>The food drops and then another gal that&rsquo;s in the restaurant dining comes over to our</p>
<p>table as the food is dropped, announces to us that she hasn&rsquo;t seen us in 10 years and</p>
<p>we acknowledge that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see you and I&rsquo;m ready for it to end immediately.</p>
<p>She then proceeds to tell us what she&rsquo;s been up to for those last 10 years in detail, in</p>
<p>painstaking detail about her job and boring details.</p>
<p>That goes to what I said, which is the inability to read the room.</p>
<p>You walk up, you say, hi, haven&rsquo;t seen you guys in a while.</p>
<p>Go back to your dinner.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Well, she didn&rsquo;t read that.</p>
<p>I finally just started eating.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, that was the real kicker was that she was there and like the waiter had to kind</p>
<p>of maneuver around her to sit the food down and she never took a breath and I was kind</p>
<p>of like, does she not, I mean, what is wrong with her?</p>
<p>Like it was bizarre.</p>
<p>It never occurred to her to say, oh my God, you just got your food.</p>
<p>It was like there was, it was, this is what I&rsquo;ve been up to the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Boring details.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even tell you what it was because all I&rsquo;m sitting there thinking about is you</p>
<p>need to leave the table immediately.</p>
<p>That has made me think of another, I&rsquo;ve had it, if I may indulge real fast.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had it with the protocol at restaurants, especially those that I&rsquo;ve been to multiple</p>
<p>times where there&rsquo;s an expectation that I&rsquo;m going to look at that menu for 15 or 20 minutes</p>
<p>before I order.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I think there needs to be a streamline procedure for when you sit down, you can order</p>
<p>immediately.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a, I&rsquo;m a big time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get it done.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be the setting down of the menu, viewing the menu, bringing the drinks</p>
<p>first and then coming back for appetizers.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, there needs to be a shotgun offer.</p>
<p>I want to be able to walk into the restaurant and they have a box that you can check shotgun.</p>
<p>That means we&rsquo;re going to shotgun you in and out of here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have eaten, leave, have paid the check all within 20, 25 minutes.</p>
<p>If they offered that approach where you could do that, I would go to that restaurant every</p>
<p>single time I went out to eat hands down.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t even be an issue because I don&rsquo;t need to look at the menu.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink alcohol.</p>
<p>I know what I want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to every place in Oklahoma City multiple times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re going to spring some new thing on me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, and I think I just don&rsquo;t enjoy being out like that either.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s get it on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the food.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Shotgun.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Josh, this reminded me of something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it from earlier.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So how about if you&rsquo;re going through the grocery store or somewhere, mall, whatever, and someone</p>
<p>starts telling you about their vacation and then pulls out their iPhone with pictures</p>
<p>of their vacation that happened to me recently.</p>
<p>And I just thought there should be a law that you cannot show people your vacation pictures</p>
<p>unless you have spent at least a week with them throughout the course of the year.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Now I do want to say this.</p>
<p>When I was a relatively new photographer, I was very proud of a lot of images I took.</p>
<p>So I would at times accost some innocent souls, torture, torture, pull up my websites</p>
<p>that I thought consisted of just really kick ass photographs and just go on and on about</p>
<p>each photograph.</p>
<p>So I admit I have been guilty of being that person at times.</p>
<p>But now that I know what it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll never do it again.</p>
<p>On the other side.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been enlightened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been enlightened.</p>
<p>Enlightened.</p>
<p>So I think that there are really bad conversationalists that don&rsquo;t take into account your feelings.</p>
<p>And I have found in work and in regular life, this is one thing that I love about my friendship</p>
<p>with Pumps, is if I have to get off the phone at any time, I can just say, I got to go click</p>
<p>and hang up on her.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to gear up for the goodbye.</p>
<p>And then that takes an additional five minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, I got to go talk to you later.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve noticed in business, if I&rsquo;m talking to a client, they&rsquo;ll call and say, hey, this</p>
<p>happened or I need this done.</p>
<p>OK, got it.</p>
<p>And then they want to tell me again.</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard you.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Solution launched.</p>
<p>So I just thought of this.</p>
<p>So I think what we&rsquo;re saying is in all aspects of life, we would like to have that box where</p>
<p>we could shotgun.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Shotgun life.</p>
<p>The event.</p>
<p>We can shorten it.</p>
<p>Whatever the experience is, whether it&rsquo;s a conversation with a dear friend, visiting</p>
<p>a loved one on their deathbed, going to a funeral, a wedding, going to dinner.</p>
<p>We need the box where we can shotgun getting in and out of that son of a bitch as fast</p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p>And maybe an asterisk for like no small, small talk because, you know, that&rsquo;s included in</p>
<p>the shot in the shotgun.</p>
<p>I like this is an in and out deal because I feel bad.</p>
<p>Like sometimes people text me like that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked to you in a while.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Did it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what do you want?</p>
<p>Just tell me what you want.</p>
<p>I think in all aspects, it can be brought up up front to where you have that expectation.</p>
<p>If somebody hadn&rsquo;t texted me in five years and they text me, hey, what&rsquo;s the blah, blah,</p>
<p>blah, blah.</p>
<p>I have no expectation that.</p>
<p>How are your kids?</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like here.</p>
<p>But let me give an example.</p>
<p>So if I run into you at the grocery store and you, Josh, Josh, and I go pumps, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to have to shotgun this one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you ought to be able to say that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You ought to be able to say that.</p>
<p>And then the other person knows.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s shotgun this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I say you ought to be able to make that declaration up front and then the</p>
<p>other person ought to respect it.</p>
<p>Do you remember that show Logan&rsquo;s run when we were little, Josh was like the military</p>
<p>guy that that&rsquo;s Logan&rsquo;s heroes.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Where they kill you after you turn 30 and so you had a light in your hand and it started</p>
<p>getting darker as you got closer to 30 and then at 30 you died.</p>
<p>So we need a shotgun button on our hands.</p>
<p>So like you walk up to somebody, they want to talk to you unnecessarily and you just</p>
<p>put it up.</p>
<p>You put it up.</p>
<p>You put it up.</p>
<p>You check the box.</p>
<p>You say, I&rsquo;m going to shotgun this pump.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to go.</p>
<p>And you go, okay.</p>
<p>See ya.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something else I want to just kind of forego altogether is the follow up.</p>
<p>How are the kids?</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;m guilty of it.</p>
<p>And people ask me all the time and I&rsquo;ll respond, you know, Dylan&rsquo;s doing this, Roman&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>I ask it, but can we just, nobody gives a shit about anybody else&rsquo;s kids.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I want to take it a step further.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we already know how their fucking kids are because we&rsquo;ve seen their</p>
<p>Instagram account.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t even have to ask it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>We know we&rsquo;re guilty of asking.</p>
<p>We already know about the vacation as well.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>The marriage, the grandbabies, the graduation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another I&rsquo;ve had it, I realize we&rsquo;re reaching our limit here, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another I&rsquo;ve had it that&rsquo;s kind of brewing and that is just the simple, I&rsquo;ve had it with</p>
<p>all of this information that we get on social media, on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>We overshare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>This podcast, my Instagram account, my website.</p>
<p>Everything is too much.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you like a little mystery.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t, people, we don&rsquo;t need all the information that we get.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>Like we lived in a day when we would drive from Oklahoma city to Dallas and there wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be three fucking words said in the entire car for three hours.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t check text messages.</p>
<p>You just sat there and looked outside the window.</p>
<p>Did you just say kind of in a roundabout way that I&rsquo;ve had it and then you kind of started</p>
<p>laundry listing and then you said this podcast?</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s part of the overstimulant of information.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>If after this podcast listens and like on Instagram, it&rsquo;s like Josh is so great.</p>
<p>You should have him on weekly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the best performing podcast in the world.</p>
<p>Would you want to come back each week?</p>
<p>I would want to be overstimulated.</p>
<p>Then it would be okay.</p>
<p>But I would still say that, Hey, it&rsquo;s silly and it&rsquo;s overstimulation, but I would definitely</p>
<p>be more interested in it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to watch it over and over and over.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think everybody admits we just have way too much information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we all fight because we just know so much and it&rsquo;s just jammed down our throats.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re just mad about it.</p>
<p>Angry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have a, let&rsquo;s round it back up to your last episode.</p>
<p>What did you tell me last night?</p>
<p>Share with the listener what you got, a new hair product that you got.</p>
<p>I got a hair fragrance spray.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by Crown Affair is the name of the company.</p>
<p>And I saw it online and used it this morning for the first time.</p>
<p>And I smelled your hair when you got here and it smells great.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t seen the video of this production yet, but I&rsquo;m anticipating that I look as good</p>
<p>as I did last time.</p>
<p>Maybe even better.</p>
<p>I want to talk about some of the real life feedback you got from the first episode where</p>
<p>people confirmed the cologne abuse.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not going to name anyone, but several people came up to me and said, you really</p>
<p>do Josh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you now that the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, I&rsquo;ve always known that I have, so no one&rsquo;s really enlightening me</p>
<p>about it because I do it knowing that I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>But let me ask you this, since it&rsquo;s been outed and then confirmed, since then are you</p>
<p>still using as many squirts?</p>
<p>I may use one or two less squirts, but I mean, so it may take it from eight to six, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a drastic reduction.</p>
<p>Eight squirts, huh?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s wrist, neck, arms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different areas that get two or three to make sure it gets, and then sometimes you</p>
<p>want to get the shirt area before the jacket goes over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole.</p>
<p>Now, how do you balance the cologne with the new hair scent?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t run into that yet to where I have kind of dueling scents when someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>close to me.</p>
<p>God, your hair smells one way, but your body smells another, you know, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>You might have to think about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to sort of see.</p>
<p>How that plays out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel better, I got my nose right in your hair to smell it and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>notice the cologne.</p>
<p>I will say this though, I didn&rsquo;t put on any cologne today because I didn&rsquo;t wear a suit</p>
<p>all day.</p>
<p>I put the suit on for the podcast, so I didn&rsquo;t, otherwise you would have smelled a stronger</p>
<p>odor coming from this direction.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this, did you put the suit on in part because you got a lot of positive</p>
<p>feedback about how goddamn good you looked on that rollout, so you thought, I&rsquo;ve set</p>
<p>the bar.</p>
<p>Let me equate it to the James Bond series, of course, when you see Daniel Craig wearing</p>
<p>that Tom Ford or Brioni suit, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Tom Ford.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to make the next movie, not wearing the Tom Ford suit, right?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s just not going to have, what are they going to do?</p>
<p>Put him in a, like a Dillard suit or something.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got to look as good in the followup movie as he did in the first one.</p>
<p>Because I think it makes perfect sense for a man in Oklahoma City as he gets dressed</p>
<p>to think Daniel Craig, James Bond.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put on this MI6 badass Tom Ford suit and I&rsquo;m going to take the 45 second drive</p>
<p>from my house to my wife&rsquo;s office and prance up there, hot shit, James Bond.</p>
<p>And I think that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>You know, tonight I think I might wear a formal gown.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a difference because for those 73 people that watch this on your YouTube</p>
<p>channel, I want them to see exactly what I look like.</p>
<p>Consistency.</p>
<p>Consistency.</p>
<p>But you also want them to see consistency.</p>
<p>I just said it was no fluke that he looks that good.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that they understand it wasn&rsquo;t a fluke.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t just having a good day.</p>
<p>This is exactly how it is every single day when I wake up.</p>
<p>This is what I look like.</p>
<p>So have you Googled yourself to see if it&rsquo;s replaced?</p>
<p>The cool sculpting?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The new look has replaced the old stuff on there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this episode really takes off to where it like pumps everything else about</p>
<p>me below this episode.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to wait and see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to scrub the Google.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about instances where we can, we wish we could check the shotgun and I want</p>
<p>to tell you one that I&rsquo;ve had it with when I travel for work and I go and check into</p>
<p>a hotel room, I walk up, you&rsquo;ve been, you&rsquo;ve been TSA, you&rsquo;ve done all this stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hi, Jennifer Welch.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my credit card.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my ID.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And they immediately say, oh, are you here for business or pleasure?</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, business.</p>
<p>Oh, what do you do for a living?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an interior designer.</p>
<p>What are you working on?</p>
<p>And I literally, at this point, I think I just want to start saying, listen, I&rsquo;m a high</p>
<p>end call girl and I&rsquo;m here with a bag of cocaine and I&rsquo;m going to turn some tricks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to answer those questions.</p>
<p>And I feel angry when they start asking me because all I want to do is check into the</p>
<p>hotel.</p>
<p>But you haven&rsquo;t even mentioned when they want to show you the room and show you the, the</p>
<p>facility.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I can figure I&rsquo;ve been in a hotel before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, again, a shotgun approach up front for these service oriented businesses.</p>
<p>They need to really consider this little box.</p>
<p>Shotgun check-in.</p>
<p>Because it would help them as well.</p>
<p>It would, it would require less manpower because you&rsquo;re dealing with people less.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The dinners would go much faster.</p>
<p>You could seat more people at the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a win-win for everybody.</p>
<p>The waitresses and waiters, they probably get tired of talking to people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;re doing in town.</p>
<p>The hotel, the concierge, they probably get tired of talking to people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just told to do it by their management.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a win-win.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So hotel check-in.</p>
<p>Hotel check-in, dinners.</p>
<p>Dining.</p>
<p>Dining.</p>
<p>I have a great one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When you go get a new phone at the AT&amp;T store.</p>
<p>Shotgun service.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know all the features.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know anything other than, is this going to be my new phone?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the best one.</p>
<p>Buying a car.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That was my next one.</p>
<p>Why are you screaming?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>We had the exact same thought.</p>
<p>Buying a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>They want to go over all the features.</p>
<p>This is better though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put, because I don&rsquo;t just get a haircut, I get a beard trim.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put personal grooming where you should be able to check the box because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always this unnecessary bantering coming with a haircut or a beard trim.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s been great about the nail salons no longer being, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak English.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t speak English.</p>
<p>They talk to each other about how terrible you are, but you don&rsquo;t know and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t check in the box except they&rsquo;re not in a rush to get you in and out.</p>
<p>Oh, my, my place knows.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But I think just in, in all aspects of any sort of service business, right, like you</p>
<p>need to offer that to your clients.</p>
<p>I wish my clients would take that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just throw it out there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>I can say, let me just shotgun this whole thing and I&rsquo;ll just let you know when your</p>
<p>project&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to say, look, I have impeccable taste.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to offer the shotgun service to where you and I don&rsquo;t have to talk about all</p>
<p>this bullshit about your carpet, wallpaper, curtains, drapes, fabrics, we don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>do that.</p>
<p>We shotgun it.</p>
<p>We shotgun it.</p>
<p>I install it.</p>
<p>I send you a big fat bill.</p>
<p>I shotgun it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>To shotgun this bill.</p>
<p>Pay it today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The payment invoicing people.</p>
<p>Shotgun it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;d like to shotgun.</p>
<p>I love my vet, Tiffany, I love you more than anything, but she comes by, you know, she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like one of these unleashed vets where she comes to you.</p>
<p>We have this cat listener and the cat has diabetes, has a lot of problem problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a female.</p>
<p>Josh always calls it a he.</p>
<p>And anyway, that cat, the cat has a lot of issues, but she, the cat has like diabetes</p>
<p>and now she&rsquo;s got some liver problem and Tiffany will call me and she&rsquo;ll start telling me in</p>
<p>detail all of the blood levels, what it means, what&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m going to start saying just Tiffany, I want to shotgun it.</p>
<p>How many more years do we have with this cat?</p>
<p>I think that cat is well past its lifespan.</p>
<p>Those cats live forever.</p>
<p>That may be the best example of a shotgun yet.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re basically saying, I don&rsquo;t want your information.</p>
<p>I want to communicate less.</p>
<p>I want less friends, fewer friends, um, on your, on your social activities, you can shotgun</p>
<p>all of those.</p>
<p>What about shotgun sex?</p>
<p>The only thing that, yeah, oh, that&rsquo;s absolutely the best one.</p>
<p>The only thing I know for a fact that Jennifer Welch will never ever shotgun is pickleball.</p>
<p>She will milk that cow for three to four hours until every ball has been hit.</p>
<p>Every point has been played.</p>
<p>Every exchange about the point has been made.</p>
<p>It could go on and on and on and she will never shotgun it.</p>
<p>By the way, for the listener, we might want to play this up front.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not into shotgunning things, you&rsquo;re going to absolutely hate this episode.</p>
<p>So, so, and we don&rsquo;t want to do them a disservice by extending this conversation longer than</p>
<p>it needs to be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made ourselves very clear about how we feel about, so we&rsquo;re going to shotgun the</p>
<p>end of this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to shotgun the end of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to let you girls do your thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to put out the listener anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed being here.</p>
<p>I love Jennifer Denise Welch.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s my wife.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the mother of my children.</p>
<p>She has kept me sober and sane.</p>
<p>She is my personal Jesus pumps.</p>
<p>I love you more than anything in the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been my longest friend that I have in my existence and thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming.</p>
<p>We love you, Joshie.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So do your thing and let&rsquo;s whip out of here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wrap.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sense code for Josh&rsquo;s dad.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s shotgun the ending.</p>
<p>Send us a voice memo.</p>
<p>Follow us.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>See you next Thursday.</p>
<p>Either way, it spells, see you later, cunts.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
