Stop trying to make Fetch happen.
Stop trying to make Fetch happen.

    <p>Saksipu, how much heat and momentum has Nikki Haley gotten this week?</p>
<p>Oh my god, stop trying to make Nikki Haley happen.</p>
<p>Fetch is not happening.</p>
<p>Stop trying to make Fetch happen.</p>
<p>Stop trying to make Fetch happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Is it happening because it&rsquo;s tomorrow?</p>
<p>This is like my long Google, short Facebook spread trade of last year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Fetch is not happening, okay?</p>
<p>Stop trying to make Fetch happen.</p>
<p>Rain Man David Saksipu.</p>
<p>Just as a programming note, we did a Twitter survey and you selected Saks as the person</p>
<p>you wanted to moderate the pod most next.</p>
<p>So welcome to Fox News Sunday, and here&rsquo;s your host, David Saks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really chafed about this, aren&rsquo;t you, J. Cal?</p>
<p>No, I am excited for it.</p>
<p>I am so excited.</p>
<p>Just to save a keyboard warrior the time, I will never, ever, ever moderate this thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m here to talk.</p>
<p>All right, three, two.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All In Pod.</p>
<p>I am your host, the Rain Man, David Saks.</p>
<p>The famous doomsday clock that atomic scientists used to measure the threat of nuclear annihilation</p>
<p>has never been closer to midnight, not even during the Cold War, but since the besties</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s more important to discuss their stock portfolios, we&rsquo;re going to save Ukraine</p>
<p>for later in the show.</p>
<p>Priorities, right, gentlemen?</p>
<p>And why not?</p>
<p>Who says you can&rsquo;t take it with you?</p>
<p>The dictator, Shamath Palihapitiya, is claiming to be entombed with his money like an Egyptian</p>
<p>pharaoh and with his sweaters too, even though it certainly won&rsquo;t be cold where he&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>And of course, he&rsquo;ll throw in the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator, Jason Kalkanis, in the</p>
<p>tomb to be his servant in the afterlife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the world Jekyll has been preparing for all his life by sucking up to every tech founder</p>
<p>and VC he can get in a room with.</p>
<p>I give better odds to the sultan of science, David Freeburg.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just paranoid enough to survive with me in the bunker, even though he still won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be questioning the Davos elites that got us here.</p>
<p>How much did that intro cost?</p>
<p>Does it come with a money back refund?</p>
<p>You guys are laughing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laughing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laughing.</p>
<p>I thought it was with you or at you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>The funniest part was when you almost read aloud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you were like, and then David Freeburg, insert pause here.</p>
<p>Reading the notes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad we do an unscripted show.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>Freeburg, I remember when you did the intro, you were like, I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>Did I actually, didn&rsquo;t we cut it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You read, and then you cut it.</p>
<p>You hated it.</p>
<p>And then we made you put it back in or something like that.</p>
<p>All I have to say to him is, job security is here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Issue one.</p>
<p>Issue one.</p>
<p>Google breakup.</p>
<p>The Just Department and eight States are now seeking to break up.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s business brokering digital advertising across the internet.</p>
<p>Attempt to rewrite history.</p>
<p>They said the DOJ mischaracterizes how its advertising products work.</p>
<p>They say that people choose to use Google because they&rsquo;re effective and the company</p>
<p>highlights other companies making moves in the advertising industry as well, such as</p>
<p>Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and TikTok.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;ll kick it to you, Chamath.</p>
<p>Do you think the DOJ has a case here?</p>
<p>Do you believe that Google has a monopoly in online advertising and is unfairly using</p>
<p>it to gain market share?</p>
<p>And is this the right remedy?</p>
<p>Breaking up the company?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that this is a totally ill-founded lawsuit and I think it just shows more of</p>
<p>the personal enmity and anger that some people in the US government has towards entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and entrepreneurship than anything else.</p>
<p>Now, why is that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just think about what a monopoly is.</p>
<p>A monopoly or a monopolist effectively creates a completely stagnant, non-vibrant market</p>
<p>in which they have pricing power and complete control.</p>
<p>Now, the argument that I think that refutes that just on its face is if you actually look,</p>
<p>number one, at their share, and number two, how the rest of the share has changed over</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>So Nick, can you just please throw that up from Bloomberg?</p>
<p>This is just in a Bloomberg article that I just shared with you guys, but Google controls</p>
<p>26.5% of a market.</p>
<p>43.4% of that market is with a diverse group of others.</p>
<p>Meta has 18.4% and Amazon has 11.7%.</p>
<p>This is not the type of pie chart you would see if you had a monopolist.</p>
<p>So for example, if you went back to the big, big, big monopolist case in the 1980s, which</p>
<p>is when we broke up Ma Bell, well, what that circle would have shown is that they basically</p>
<p>had effectively 100% share.</p>
<p>What this shows is that there&rsquo;s a huge diversity of people in this market.</p>
<p>The second thing is that if you had done this chart many years ago, Amazon would not have</p>
<p>really even been there.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, they represent almost 12% of the entire market, and it means that</p>
<p>if you forecast it forward, they could be at 15% to 20% in a few years as well.</p>
<p>While the pie is growing, and definitely Google takes a lot of the profit dollars, the distribution</p>
<p>is so much more than what anything looks like in a monopoly.</p>
<p>I just think it means that the DOJ is more focused on trying to punish these great American</p>
<p>companies than it is in trying to be logical and reasoned.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is going to work.</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;ll say about this is that if you think about what you should have done</p>
<p>if I were the US government, I would have actually focused on search because search</p>
<p>is a monopoly for Google.</p>
<p>While Google would try to argue that there are other ways of acquiring information, that</p>
<p>is really not true.</p>
<p>If you could prove that that monopoly then led to pricing power in ads, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a much more nuanced but logical argument that could work.</p>
<p>By focusing on this, I think it&rsquo;s going to get deconstructed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to fail.</p>
<p>This version of this exact lawsuit already was thrown out of federal court.</p>
<p>I think that judges and the legal system don&rsquo;t have a lot of patience for this thing.</p>
<p>It just meant more to scare American companies and try to play boogeyman and decision maker</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>Freerick, let me go to you.</p>
<p>I think Tramont raises a really great point that if you define the market as digital advertising,</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s market share is only about a quarter.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem like a monopoly.</p>
<p>However, what the government says is that you shouldn&rsquo;t look at digital advertising</p>
<p>as a whole, but rather this sort of brokered advertising that Google does for third-party</p>
<p>websites and applications.</p>
<p>Let me show a chart from their lawsuit.</p>
<p>You can see here that the way they define it, again, they see it as this brokering of</p>
<p>sell-side inventory, which are website publishers, and then buy-side demand, which are advertisers.</p>
<p>If you define it this way, it looks like Google has 90% or more market share on the sell-side</p>
<p>because of the double-click acquisition.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got somewhere between 40% and 80% market share on the demand side with advertisers.</p>
<p>In the middle, they have over 50% market share of the ad exchange.</p>
<p>Is this the right way to look at Google&rsquo;s business or should we be just thinking about</p>
<p>in terms of the overall digital advertising market?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in ad networks since about 2002.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not directly involved in the business anymore, but I was pretty close to</p>
<p>this and I was pretty close to double-click and the acquisition.</p>
<p>I was a business product manager for a period of time on AdWords.</p>
<p>The way that that chart shows the connection between advertisers and publishers is correct</p>
<p>that an ad network, generally speaking, brings buyers of ad inventory to the sellers of</p>
<p>ad inventory.</p>
<p>The sellers of ad inventory have the option to sell their inventory on an ad network.</p>
<p>If the money that they&rsquo;re making on those ad slots that they have, whether it&rsquo;s a slot</p>
<p>on the side of a page or the top of a page or an interstitial video ad, whatever it is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to keep selling their inventory through that network if they&rsquo;re getting paid</p>
<p>the most.</p>
<p>The real reason Google has won is two-part.</p>
<p>One is because they ran their ad network as an auction, meaning advertisers were competing</p>
<p>with each other to pay the most for an ad spot that was the highest quality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an ad quality index calculation, a click-through index, a bounce-back index.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this data that feeds into Google&rsquo;s ad network auction so that the ad that&rsquo;s shown</p>
<p>on the publisher&rsquo;s site is not just the best ad for the publisher, but the best ad for</p>
<p>the consumer.</p>
<p>Then when the consumer clicks on the ad, the publisher gets paid.</p>
<p>The second thing that Google did, and so the auction dynamic is a really powerful dynamic.</p>
<p>It creates the best price for the publisher, and it creates the highest quality ad for</p>
<p>the user, which translates typically into higher click-throughs and better revenue.</p>
<p>What they also did that was really powerful is they did the highest revenue share in the</p>
<p>market.</p>
<p>Historically, ad networks had, I think, initially like a 60-40 rev share where the only paid</p>
<p>publisher is 40% of the revenue the advertiser paid.</p>
<p>Then the network started to move to a 55-45 model, then a 50-50 model, then a 45-55 model.</p>
<p>I believe on average Google currently is paying somewhere between 70 and 80% to their publishers.</p>
<p>I got to check my math on that or whatever the latest earnings report is.</p>
<p>I heard high 60s, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so but call it 70.</p>
<p>And so it is a very competitive share.</p>
<p>Now the point being, because it&rsquo;s an auction system and because it&rsquo;s opt-in by the publisher,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not paying the highest price, the publisher can go and get ads from somewhere</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>And historically, publishers built their own sales force to sell ads and to source advertisers</p>
<p>and to make money off of their ad inventory.</p>
<p>And it turns out it was a lot more effective to use an ad network to do that.</p>
<p>The other ad networks simply haven&rsquo;t been as good at building an auction model and building</p>
<p>competitiveness.</p>
<p>But I will tell you that when you get to a certain volume, and it&rsquo;s not a big volume,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need a million advertisers bidding against each other, you only need a few dozen</p>
<p>advertisers.</p>
<p>And once you have a few dozen advertisers bidding against each other, you start to get</p>
<p>very competitive in inventory.</p>
<p>So Google&rsquo;s real lock in with publishers and the real reason they win in this marketplace</p>
<p>is because they pay the publishers the most.</p>
<p>And if you try and break this up, and if you actually do try and, you know, get into the</p>
<p>weeds of this whole system and change it, the publishers ultimately will make less money.</p>
<p>And this will be a real problem on the publisher side that they&rsquo;re making the most money, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting the highest share of advertiser spend, and consumers are getting the best quality</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes Google&rsquo;s model so hard to tackle from an antitrust perspective, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s giving so basically are is what you&rsquo;re saying that because fundamentally, this is</p>
<p>an auction model, it prevents Google from extracting monopoly rents, correct?</p>
<p>And, and they already pay the highest share on their ad network back to the publishers.</p>
<p>And so you could go in and say, hey, high 60s or 70%, they should be paying 90%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real right number.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re already paying more than anyone else to the publishers, they&rsquo;re already making</p>
<p>a lower margin than anyone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, let me just let me just add two more things.</p>
<p>Sorry, which I think are just okay, go to Jake out first, as we got Jake Allen here,</p>
<p>even though he wouldn&rsquo;t do the same for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jake, how do you agree with freeberg that, that the reason for Google&rsquo;s success is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hyper efficient.</p>
<p>And this auction mechanism prevents monopoly behavior?</p>
<p>No, I there is monopoly behavior going on at Google, obviously, with search and putting</p>
<p>their own content and services up top.</p>
<p>And to Schmott&rsquo;s point, like that&rsquo;s probably the easier target.</p>
<p>Here this just feels like they are maybe 10 years behind, they should have just blocked</p>
<p>the double click, you know, acquisition in 2008.</p>
<p>And this consolidation of power, the what publishers would say to freeberg point is,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re selling your own advertising, you get a much higher CPM when you go direct</p>
<p>to Samsung or IBM or Disney.</p>
<p>And so you want to create those direct relationships.</p>
<p>So how much do those direct relationships cost?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably 20 or 30%, which is exactly to the percentage that Google is taking off</p>
<p>the top.</p>
<p>So Google is pretty aware of that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just paradoxical that they&rsquo;re doing this at this time, David, because Amazon has</p>
<p>developed a huge ad business, Netflix and Disney have now have ad tiers for their services</p>
<p>to go up against YouTube.</p>
<p>So and then for the first time, we&rsquo;re even talking about Google search supremacy being</p>
<p>challenged by chat GPT.</p>
<p>So much like what happened with Microsoft, you know, they&rsquo;re just late 10 years too late,</p>
<p>maybe.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So to use one of your favorite words is the DOJ acting as a rug puller here for Google</p>
<p>in the sense that they&rsquo;re trying to unwind 10 year old acquisitions.</p>
<p>Is that does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.</p>
<p>Should the government be able to unwind acquisitions that happened a decade ago?</p>
<p>Does that make any sense?</p>
<p>No, no, no, they have that they should, they should learn from it and not do it again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a pretty bad way to approach things because they create so much uncertainty</p>
<p>in the marketplace and has a chilling effect on future acquisitions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like when you get approval from the government, you want to know you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we have an approval process.</p>
<p>So it seems to me I agree with Jake out like, if the government is gonna have a problem</p>
<p>with an acquisition, state it up front, but then once they approve it, you&rsquo;re approved,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you know, companies will be much less likely to engage in acquisitions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to have a chilling effect on M&amp;A behavior in the ecosystem, which is</p>
<p>bad for the ecosystem as a whole, but it really does need these exits.</p>
<p>It puts us competitiveness against every other country and any other regulatory regime that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be more permissive to this stuff.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And I think this is what&rsquo;s lost on this.</p>
<p>I just feel these lawsuits right now are bordering on the mean spirited because these things</p>
<p>have been tried, they&rsquo;ve generally failed.</p>
<p>And so the real solution, it always goes back to this, and it&rsquo;s ugly and messy is you</p>
<p>need to rewrite the actual laws to reflect how business conditions exist today.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not the responsibility of the DOJ to try to fit a round peg into a square</p>
<p>hole.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to manipulate and contort the law to try to go after somebody that shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>frankly be gone after because these deals to your point were done a decade ago.</p>
<p>And they were done legally, and they were done rightly.</p>
<p>So if you have an issue with how the market has evolved, change the law.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also add, I totally agree with Chamath.</p>
<p>I think that this action, you know, as one of our friends put it on our on our text stream,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like killing the golden goose.</p>
<p>I mean, this is one of the big job creators, innovators and taxpayers and employers, and</p>
<p>drivers of economic growth.</p>
<p>And why would we allow that to go and kind of burgeon offshore as a government?</p>
<p>This is absolutely going to become kind of an opening for some, you know, international</p>
<p>competitor to come in and try and provide alternative services with similar economics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also say I just sent you guys a link, I&rsquo;ll send you one more, the market itself</p>
<p>is becoming so much more challenging to operate in as an ad network.</p>
<p>You know, e commerce.</p>
<p>So Amazon&rsquo;s ad business is booming, right, as Chamath pointed out earlier.</p>
<p>But so much more of consumer behavior is shifting where people are going direct to e commerce</p>
<p>sites.</p>
<p>And then the ads that are getting the highest click through, and where advertisers are spending</p>
<p>more and more money is on e commerce sites.</p>
<p>I know this from experience on a couple boards I&rsquo;m at, where companies stopped spending on</p>
<p>Facebook and Google and just started spending exclusively on Amazon.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you get consumers that are much more likely to purchase the purchasing</p>
<p>proclivity is higher, the click through rate is higher.</p>
<p>So the return on ad spend is much higher.</p>
<p>And then I think that there&rsquo;s a big shift happening right now, as you guys know, with</p>
<p>third party cookies, Google has declared that they&rsquo;re removing third party cookies in 2024.</p>
<p>This means that in 2024, it is going to be very hard to track a user from one website</p>
<p>to the next.</p>
<p>If you go to a website and look at furniture, and then you go to another website, third</p>
<p>party cookies, allow an advertiser to find you on that other website, knowing that you</p>
<p>were just looking at furniture and send you a furniture ad and say, Hey, come on over.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re more likely to click on that ad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very effective for advertising, and particularly in the segment of advertising</p>
<p>called retargeting.</p>
<p>But it is becoming much harder to do this with third party cookies and with the Apple</p>
<p>identifier being yanked.</p>
<p>And Google just made an attempt to try and get this change with a W three C that was</p>
<p>rejected.</p>
<p>And that change is now going to make this hit very, very hard beginning in 2024.</p>
<p>So the ad networks themselves are already being massively hurt by apples, ID changes,</p>
<p>the third party cookies being removed, it&rsquo;s becoming harder to target consumers harder</p>
<p>to make money as a for publishers.</p>
<p>So meanwhile, the market&rsquo;s being challenged, and Amazon&rsquo;s coming in the inverse definition</p>
<p>of a monopoly.</p>
<p>When you have a market where there is dynamism, where companies are changing the rules.</p>
<p>And that is reallocating share gains to different players.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of a dynamic market that&rsquo;s self regulating.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Five years ago, this would have made more sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, much more sense.</p>
<p>So I think just this goes back down to one basic thing, which is, do our elected and</p>
<p>appointed officials really understand what&rsquo;s going on in the economy.</p>
<p>And I think this is an example that highlights not as much as they should.</p>
<p>And before a lawsuit like this gets filed, they should call us up.</p>
<p>If they called 30 of us into a room one by one and said, Can you please explain how this</p>
<p>works?</p>
<p>You would have come to a different conclusion, because we could have articulated these things,</p>
<p>and it would have been clear.</p>
<p>And so why do they not do that?</p>
<p>Or if they do do it, who&rsquo;s actually in there?</p>
<p>Either way, whatever&rsquo;s getting to the conclusion of let&rsquo;s go file this lawsuit in 2023 is late</p>
<p>at a minimum and misguided at best, you know,</p>
<p>you have to ask the question, like, how is this different than Xi Jinping saying, you</p>
<p>know what, Jack Ma is too powerful, therefore, he&rsquo;s going to learn to pay.</p>
<p>I think this is like, our government is saying, Google, it is totally different.</p>
<p>Totally different.</p>
<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>Totally different.</p>
<p>But I think that this lawsuit makes no sense.</p>
<p>You always have to bring it back to China.</p>
<p>Does everything in your brain have to virtue signal like it&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m trying to be</p>
<p>intellectually interesting conversation.</p>
<p>Jason.</p>
<p>Jason.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still manning an intellectually honest position.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>Let me finish tomorrow.</p>
<p>Let me finish before you jump the fence.</p>
<p>Very simply.</p>
<p>You asked, like, why are they filing something that makes no sense?</p>
<p>My position is I think they want to have an outcome.</p>
<p>And their outcome is they want to stick it to big tech because it&rsquo;s too powerful.</p>
<p>And then you just said yourself, square peg round hole.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to find something to get Google on.</p>
<p>This is not it.</p>
<p>How does it relate to China?</p>
<p>Well, actually, I kind of agree with Jekyll here, actually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll defend it for a second.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just a second.</p>
<p>World&rsquo;s second greatest moderator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Third greatest.</p>
<p>Take China out of it for a second, because that could mean a lot of different things.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t want to get hung up on that.</p>
<p>But it does feel to me like the government is lashing out against companies like Google</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re perceived as being too powerful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And in fact, I mean, that&rsquo;s Lena Khan&rsquo;s theory is that we have to stop big tech companies</p>
<p>from getting bigger because power.</p>
<p>But in this case, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense because the auction market for advertising</p>
<p>is very competitive and the remedy of unwinding 10-year-old deals doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>So yeah, they&rsquo;re just kind of barking up the wrong tree is sort of the idea here.</p>
<p>One final thing, David.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two other things that they really should be looking at.</p>
<p>As these ad networks are losing their market share in the overall digital ad spend, there</p>
<p>are two other players, Disney, you know, and Netflix doing these digital ads on their</p>
<p>platforms and having ad tiers.</p>
<p>And then you may have noticed Uber is doing an ad business now.</p>
<p>They did $350 million in the first year of that business, a million a day, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>projected to do a billion next year.</p>
<p>And those have location information in it because you have your destination.</p>
<p>And so those opportunities are emerging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic space.</p>
<p>I just want to say like, you guys are making like, I think a really important macro point,</p>
<p>which is, like in a marketplace, it&rsquo;s always easy to hate the winners and claim that their</p>
<p>success is unfair, if you&rsquo;re not part of it.</p>
<p>And I think that just because something successful in a marketplace doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a monopoly.</p>
<p>You know, this whole thing of envy, you know, we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve heard from like the Berkshire</p>
<p>shareholders meeting, I think there was a good conversation around this, but envy really</p>
<p>is ultimately the doom of innovation and democracy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you see the success, you want to take down the successful, nothing can be too</p>
<p>successful, or else it has to be destroyed.</p>
<p>And then, you know, as we talked about, it&rsquo;s going to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, just play devil&rsquo;s advocate with it on that, Freeberg.</p>
<p>It sounds like we all agree that the government has kind of the wrong theory and is barking</p>
<p>up the wrong tree here.</p>
<p>However, isn&rsquo;t it the case that Apple and Google are too powerful, maybe not in this</p>
<p>auction, advertising auction marketplace.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the App Store, I mean, they have an operating system monopoly with</p>
<p>iOS and Android or duopoly.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re bringing up the key point, which is these nuances are the</p>
<p>ones that matter.</p>
<p>There is a body of law today, David, that you can apply pretty intelligently and thoughtfully</p>
<p>to that exact problem, and also to Google search.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a bit of a head scratcher why the DOJ hasn&rsquo;t spent the time to figure out</p>
<p>to even understand that that&rsquo;s actually where they should be focused, because that is where</p>
<p>there is truly in the app, it&rsquo;s a duopoly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very clear.</p>
<p>The share shift has already been set.</p>
<p>There is no share shift happening to a third player.</p>
<p>There is no side loading that&rsquo;s really happening.</p>
<p>And so domestically in the United States and Western Europe, there&rsquo;s a de facto duopoly,</p>
<p>complete control, completely inflexible, inelastic pricing.</p>
<p>That is a monopoly.</p>
<p>And then separately for search in the United States, it is also an effective monopoly.</p>
<p>And those are the things where if you really wanted to go after them, because you think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some damage being done to people, I would have focused there.</p>
<p>But the ad business has nothing to do with any of this and just means that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how the market works.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, so shifting gears, Microsoft has just been sued on antitrust grounds, or rather</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a probe by the EU.</p>
<p>And this was based on a complaint actually from Slack.</p>
<p>Slack filed a complaint back in 2020 that Microsoft was basically engaging in bundling</p>
<p>or tying of products.</p>
<p>The allegation is that Microsoft unfairly ties Microsoft Teams and other software to</p>
<p>its widely used Office suite.</p>
<p>Do you guys think that&rsquo;s a better claim?</p>
<p>Okay, so-</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll just say like, you know, there was an episode that we did, I think back in</p>
<p>September, where I basically railed against Microsoft for exactly this kind of bundling.</p>
<p>It seems like the EU has picked up that theory and wants to go after bundling.</p>
<p>We did Slack Series A, I was on the board, took it public, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the thing that we talked about a lot.</p>
<p>That was the thing that I was always like the most afraid of, which is how can we compete</p>
<p>with a better product in the face of superior distribution?</p>
<p>I think what Microsoft did was anti-competitive, but I don&rsquo;t think it was monopolistic.</p>
<p>And I think that the EU in that time has a much better framework of laws that they had</p>
<p>demonstrated up until now they were willing to enforce around anti-competitive pricing.</p>
<p>And so part of what Slack was trying to do was create some airspace for that to get into</p>
<p>the ether, to the discussion that it&rsquo;s like, we could build the best product in the world,</p>
<p>but if Microsoft gives it away with this other product that is quasi-essential,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll always beat us and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>And I think that was basically the question that was posed to the European authorities,</p>
<p>because we thought that they would pay attention to it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about it is that then, you know, when the acquisition happened</p>
<p>to Salesforce, it sort of waters down that claim, because now Salesforce also has</p>
<p>a set of really essential products that are useful and needed in the market</p>
<p>that Slack can go and attach themselves to.</p>
<p>And in many ways, David, it forced the hand of Slack to be acquired by Salesforce.</p>
<p>And if not Salesforce, it would have to have been somebody else.</p>
<p>But could it have been an independent company had we not had to compete against teams in that way?</p>
<p>Meaning if we had to compete against another well-funded startup,</p>
<p>would it still be public?</p>
<p>I suspect so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we would have sold to Salesforce.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly was my point when we talked about this last time,</p>
<p>is that if Microsoft can basically clone the sort of the breakthrough innovative product,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s say they do one every year.</p>
<p>And then they put a crappy version of that in their bundle.</p>
<p>Yeah, 10% or 50% worse.</p>
<p>But they give it away effectively for free as part of the bundle.</p>
<p>And then they basically pull the legs out from under that other company.</p>
<p>So it can&rsquo;t be a vibrant competitor.</p>
<p>And then the next year, they&rsquo;ll just raise the price of the bundle, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done that with Slack.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done that with Okta.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done that with Zoom.</p>
<p>You know, Jake, how can we have a vibrant tech ecosystem,</p>
<p>at least in B2B software, if Microsoft can just keep doing that indefinitely?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a difficult question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, though, if what the consumer harm is here,</p>
<p>if you keep adding great features to a bundle.</p>
<p>So to take the other side of the argument, you know, Zoom has now added channels like Slack.</p>
<p>Slack has added huddles, which are essentially Zoom calls.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re both going to try to add the Koda and Notion</p>
<p>wiki style, you know, documents to both Zoom and Slack.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s copying everybody&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s incorporating everybody&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit of time.</p>
<p>This is actually a lot better behavior for Microsoft</p>
<p>than the old days when they would do something called vaporware.</p>
<p>They used to announce products to chill people from buying them.</p>
<p>So they would announce a Slack two years before Slack came out,</p>
<p>just to get people to not install Slack.</p>
<p>They did that with Lotus Notes.</p>
<p>They said they had a Lotus Notes competitor coming for two years,</p>
<p>and it never materialized.</p>
<p>So I think the marketplace will compete.</p>
<p>And if you look at Slack itself, it&rsquo;s still growing the same percentage growth it did</p>
<p>inside of Salesforce that it did as an independent company.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s growing at a similar pace.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>Wait, Nick, can you pull up this chart?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was like high teens or something.</p>
<p>Was there growth?</p>
<p>It looks like from this chart that Slack has kind of leveled off.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the number of users.</p>
<p>I was talking about revenue.</p>
<p>If you look at Slack&rsquo;s revenue, quarter over quarter, it&rsquo;s basically been the same.</p>
<p>But wasn&rsquo;t there a report that it&rsquo;s been a little bit of a</p>
<p>disappointment to Salesforce or no?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, this number here that we&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>where it says 75 million Microsoft Teams members, 12 million Slack members.</p>
<p>By the way, if you wanted to play conspiracy theorist,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s why there was a falling out between Benioff and Brett.</p>
<p>I mean, Brett was the champion of this deal, $28 billion acquisition.</p>
<p>And $28 billion, it&rsquo;s threading a needle.</p>
<p>The only one of that scale that&rsquo;s really worked out definitively has been LinkedIn.</p>
<p>So if Slack hiccuped in a moment when we also had a regime change in rates and valuations,</p>
<p>now look at Benioff is looking down the barrel of an activist investor program from Elliott.</p>
<p>Man, I mean, yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s not doing as well as they needed it to.</p>
<p>I got the sense that Benioff was genuinely sorry that Brett</p>
<p>decided to leave and that it was voluntary, voluntary on Brett&rsquo;s part,</p>
<p>and regretted basically, as opposed to, you know, a non regretted termination.</p>
<p>I have no idea. Like I said, I was pre I was pre qualifying with saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s play conspiracy for a second.</p>
<p>Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion. Here&rsquo;s a suggestion for the regulators that are listening or watching</p>
<p>our podcast. A really valuable thing for the industry that you could do would be to introduce</p>
<p>transparency on ELAs. What are those enterprise licensing agreements? These are these things that</p>
<p>these big companies use to throw everything in the kitchen sink into a deal when they sell to</p>
<p>a company. But if there was transparency, and there was a sense of how those things were priced.</p>
<p>So think of it like the FDA saying, here&rsquo;s you have to publish your ingredients, right?</p>
<p>And what percentage of it is this and that it would be really beneficial because it would</p>
<p>slow down the tendency of these big companies to try to kill the small companies with these</p>
<p>poorer products. And something around ELAs and more transparency around pricing to the market</p>
<p>could be a good governor without having to go down the path of all this antitrust legislation.</p>
<p>After the fact,</p>
<p>I think there is some good advice for regulators there. I think they should focus on anti</p>
<p>competitive tactics, and like clarifying what those are, as opposed to some of these crazy</p>
<p>lawsuits to break up companies that don&rsquo;t seem to have well grounded theories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be I think, better to focus on the specific tactics that create the harm</p>
<p>and identifying what those are. Jake, out of your point about how what Microsoft is doing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to be harming anybody, it seems to be benefiting consumers. I think that&rsquo;s a valid</p>
<p>point. But I would bring up a different example, which is if you look at the anti competitive</p>
<p>behavior of dumping, where a company will basically dump its product on the market for free,</p>
<p>destroy all the other competitors. And once they&rsquo;re out, they can raise prices because</p>
<p>the barriers to entry are high, there&rsquo;s a huge cost of like, basically entering the industry.</p>
<p>I think that this bundling behavior is a form of dumping, where in the short run,</p>
<p>it looks like consumers are benefiting because they&rsquo;re getting a Zoom clone for free,</p>
<p>or a Slack clone for free. But then what happens is once they&rsquo;ve hobbled those companies,</p>
<p>they raise the price of the bundle. So I think if we want to have a healthy long term ecosystem,</p>
<p>I think this type of like bundling behavior is bad. I think it&rsquo;s anti competitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a very specific solution for it. You don&rsquo;t need to break up Microsoft.</p>
<p>What you need to do is require that when they create a bundle, every product in that bundle</p>
<p>needs to basically have an individual price. And the price of every product in that bundle</p>
<p>should add up to the cost of the bundle. So they can&rsquo;t do like you said, Chamath,</p>
<p>these like transfer payments, or subsidies to basically, you know, take over systematically</p>
<p>take over every SAS vertical.</p>
<p>I think that would be amazing. By the way, there are many other markets,</p>
<p>David, where that exactly exists, where if you have the ability to</p>
<p>preferentially put your product into your distribution channel,</p>
<p>you have to transfer price it transparently at the market.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what everybody else would be able to get it at. And that then allows the best product</p>
<p>to win in the market. And it gives the government the ability to say, I understand that these rails</p>
<p>are roughly monopolistic, but I&rsquo;m going to leave them alone, as long as you treat everything that</p>
<p>sits on top of those rails equally. And that nuance is missing in software. So I think the</p>
<p>combination of transparency in these enterprise licensing agreements, and more transparency and</p>
<p>accounting treatment for what you just said, would solve a lot of this problem. And you would have a</p>
<p>more vibrant ecosystem where the big guys can&rsquo;t just snuff out the small guys whenever they want.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just agree with you guys. Let me just let me just play. Let me just play my devil&rsquo;s</p>
<p>advocate, which is kind of how I feel as well. I think these concepts of monopolistic bundling</p>
<p>made a lot of sense I make a lot of sense in the sense in if what you&rsquo;re bundling in the service or</p>
<p>the product or whatever is a commodity product. And these statements that you&rsquo;re making, assume</p>
<p>that one messaging service is the same as a must another messaging service that one video app is</p>
<p>the same as another video app. And that by giving a discount, they&rsquo;re going to win the market,</p>
<p>the reality that may have made sense back in the day when there were things like trains and trains</p>
<p>had a monopoly on where things could go or electricity or oil production, and all of the</p>
<p>kind of origins of kind of monopolistic antitrust laws and action started to kind of emerge here in</p>
<p>our free market in the US. But when it comes to software, if your product is the same as the other</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s product, maybe they deserve to win by bundling. And maybe it&rsquo;s okay for them to offer</p>
<p>a discount and beat you on pricing. Because if your product is actually better, and it provides</p>
<p>better ROI for the customer, it has a better feature set, it&rsquo;s faster, it has a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>that the other product doesn&rsquo;t have, the market will pick it. It&rsquo;s not that the market&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>say, hey, we&rsquo;re just a bunch of idiots. These products are so differentiated. But because these</p>
<p>guys are giving me a discount, I&rsquo;m going to go over to the discount. That&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>And you guys know this. I&rsquo;m not saying that Microsoft can&rsquo;t copy slack and then under charge</p>
<p>a different price and charge a different price and a lower price and discounted. What I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t cross subsidize their slack competitor. It&rsquo;s the fact that they can copy slack that makes</p>
<p>slack. That means that slack should lose the fact that that&rsquo;s slack.</p>
<p>Look, software, new software is really hard to create, but really easy to copy.</p>
<p>I mean, the first version of a new product is hard to create. But you can reverse engineer</p>
<p>almost any software product. Show me where someone&rsquo;s made a better competitor to Google</p>
<p>search. Show me where like consumers don&rsquo;t choose to go to another search engine because Google&rsquo;s</p>
<p>built a better search engine. No, it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a data network effect there that the</p>
<p>more searches they provide, the more data they get. It&rsquo;s the reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ll say differently. It&rsquo;s easier to copy. There&rsquo;s an asymptote to that quality point,</p>
<p>though. I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s necessarily No, I think I think there&rsquo;s a nuance here that</p>
<p>and by the way, all the social networks that people thought were had massive lock in effect</p>
<p>turns out they don&rsquo;t write David. No, that&rsquo;s not true. Look, there&rsquo;s more lock in deeper in the</p>
<p>stack that you exist. There&rsquo;s very little lock in at the application layer. So workflow apps,</p>
<p>which effectively is what most of these enterprise software things are, are very copyable,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nothing that really locks it in. But if you&rsquo;re a social network, or if you&rsquo;re some</p>
<p>deep machine learned thing that basically generates great search results, that&rsquo;s much harder to copy</p>
<p>because more and more of the product, precise generates the product qualities underneath the</p>
<p>waterline. But I think in enterprise software, it&rsquo;s all thin UI layers on top of very simple,</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t compete because the bigger guy that offers a discount is always going to beat you</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s saying, which I agree with is you just if you could add transparency so that you</p>
<p>understand what is happening. I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s against transparency. Nobody should</p>
<p>be against it. And if Microsoft wants to charge a penny a seat for teams, then they should be</p>
<p>allowed to do that. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re saying that they shouldn&rsquo;t. A lot of startups have used</p>
<p>the opposite tactic where they&rsquo;ve entered with free offerings or free services, and then they</p>
<p>try and upsell later. And we don&rsquo;t complain about that. There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to compete.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my point. There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to compete in the marketplace. If the product you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>offering is of parity. No, the problem is a commodity, that no problem build something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different enough that people are willing to pay for it. Well, then they&rsquo;re willing to pay</p>
<p>more than they&rsquo;ll pay the big guy that&rsquo;s giving them a bundling discount, just build a better</p>
<p>product, then the whole b2b SaaS space should basically pack up shop and go home, we should</p>
<p>just stop funding VC should stop funding new SaaS companies, because and almost productivity</p>
<p>gains will just go out the window. Yeah, why would you fund any product? I competitive them?</p>
<p>Yeah, how&rsquo;s that bad for the customer? They&rsquo;re paying less, and they&rsquo;re getting a better,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be fewer new products created. Yeah, freeberg at the limit, what you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>saying is because Comcast is a monopolistic provider of my internet connection, I should</p>
<p>have to take their video offering and will never use Netflix. No, it&rsquo;s like they have they offer a</p>
<p>commodity. That&rsquo;s my point. If you&rsquo;re offering a commodity, these things should apply. But what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, but what you&rsquo;re saying effectively, and what you just said is that b2b software is</p>
<p>effectively a commodity. Anyone can copy it. Anyone can replicate said to you, I&rsquo;m turning</p>
<p>this off, you only have one choice and it&rsquo;s mine, because this is my rails and I built it,</p>
<p>you would turn to the government to help you because you would say but Netflix is a better</p>
<p>product. And what David is saying is the exact same argument. So my point is, unless you also</p>
<p>believe logically that you&rsquo;re allowed to turn off Netflix, if you&rsquo;re Comcast, and take their crappy</p>
<p>VOD service, then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re at least intellectually consistent. But if you</p>
<p>feel as a commodity to steal as a commodity to and you can&rsquo;t engage in dumping, I mean,</p>
<p>this is the argument is that, for example, you know, with respect to China, the argument was</p>
<p>that they were dumping cheap steel in the US market to drive all the US producers out of</p>
<p>business. And then once they were out of business, they&rsquo;d raise the price.</p>
<p>The point is, there&rsquo;s all these examples where we have had the intelligence and the ability to</p>
<p>be nuanced about this to see that these things are possible, and they shouldn&rsquo;t exist. We don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>Comcast turn off Netflix. Okay, we have a law around that. I understand. So my so I think what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re saying is, embrace and extend this law for these new markets that didn&rsquo;t exist 50 and 100</p>
<p>years ago, when these laws were written, so that the same benefits that we have in the steel market,</p>
<p>and in the cable market, we have in the software market, it&rsquo;ll just create a healthier ecosystem.</p>
<p>Jekyll, you want to get in on this?</p>
<p>I wonder when you install teams, does it automatically when you install the Microsoft</p>
<p>Office suite, does it automatically install teams? Because it does seem the default there matters? Do</p>
<p>people have to actively turn it on? Or is it actively built in? And so the bundling of it,</p>
<p>I think matters. And then interoperability matters. So there are other vectors here,</p>
<p>to force some interoperability. So if you open your Windows machine, do you have a choice of</p>
<p>it depends which browser, let&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s just say that you use exchange for certain things. But</p>
<p>in other things, for example, to manage your namespace, you may use Okta. But then they say,</p>
<p>actually, no, we need you to use our version of Okta. It all becomes complicated. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too complicated for a government to understand. So I think the general thing is, can we extend</p>
<p>the definition of these basic rules that we&rsquo;ve agreed to in other markets, to include technology,</p>
<p>and would we be better served? And I think for the most part, I do think it would be it would</p>
<p>better serve startups, it would better serve the folks that want to build.</p>
<p>How would that work in practicality, though, you would, you would</p>
<p>turn it on for $1 a person or something? Here&rsquo;s introductory price.</p>
<p>I think the combination of what David said, and I said would do the trick, which is if you force</p>
<p>these highly complicated license agreements, to be transparent, it would not allow them to dump.</p>
<p>And then the second thing is that all of that transfer pricing that goes into that license cost</p>
<p>needs to sum up to the cost itself. Now, why is that important? You can learn about how they prevent</p>
<p>this in healthcare. So let&rsquo;s take Pfizer good example, here&rsquo;s a company with $30 billion on</p>
<p>the balance sheet, right? And Pfizer has a need still to subsidize all of the R&amp;D of their drugs.</p>
<p>And you would say, well, yeah, they have $30 billion. So they should just take the money off</p>
<p>the balance sheet and do it. Why don&rsquo;t they do it? It&rsquo;s because the accounting laws and all of</p>
<p>the complicated anti competitive laws say, well, if you want to take this cash pile and use it over</p>
<p>here, it goes from an asset liability item, 30 billion of cash, and all of a sudden, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to net it against your EPS. All right. There&rsquo;s an actual cost for these companies to do this stuff,</p>
<p>to bundle to cross to all of this stuff. And so what do they do, they go into the market,</p>
<p>they ask startups to build stuff, and then they buy it. That&rsquo;s the kind of market I think is</p>
<p>better for us. Yeah, let&rsquo;s have that be the last word on this topic, because we&rsquo;ve been going for</p>
<p>a while. But I&rsquo;m glad you brought up Pfizer, because this brings us to issue two, which is</p>
<p>and I think we can show this credit meet for David. Yeah. So Albert burlows, the CEO of Pfizer</p>
<p>went to Davos last week, and he probably expect to Davos, you know, the conference of the surplus</p>
<p>elites. And he expected probably nothing but softballs and fawning treatment from the establishment</p>
<p>media. And instead, he probably had the most uncomfortable walk of his life when two reporters</p>
<p>from rebel news approached him outside the governor and started asking him some tough</p>
<p>questions. Let&rsquo;s roll tape. What&rsquo;s rebel news? Or like, can I ask you, when did you know that</p>
<p>the vaccines didn&rsquo;t stop transmission? How long did you know that without saying it publicly?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I mean, we now know that the vaccines didn&rsquo;t stop transmission. But why did you keep it secret?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>You said it was 100% effective, then 90%, then 80%, then 70%. But we now know that the vaccines</p>
<p>do not trans stop transmission. Why did you keep that secret?</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t have a nice day until I know the answer. Why did you keep it a secret that your vaccine</p>
<p>did not stop transmission will come in?</p>
<p>We should we should we should cut this.</p>
<p>Okay, we can stop from there. But that Wow, welcome to info wars.</p>
<p>All info wars. First of all, that&rsquo;s what real journalism looks like.</p>
<p>Times reporters covering for powerful people, but asking them tough questions.</p>
<p>Is that a legitimate question?</p>
<p>What do you think of the question? Is it legit or not?</p>
<p>You got you guys are about to get us downranked on YouTube and Spotify.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to get warning labels for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re right that YouTube banned that video. We had to watch it on Twitter,</p>
<p>because Elon Musk Twitter is still free.</p>
<p>Okay, listen,</p>
<p>Why is YouTube protecting? Why? Hold on. Why is YouTube abridging freedom of the press</p>
<p>in order to protect the powerful CEO Pfizer from answering more questions that are legitimate?</p>
<p>Yeah, just basic questions.</p>
<p>Is it a legitimate question of did they cover up the fact that the vaccine didn&rsquo;t transmit? I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a legitimate question that I would actually want to know the answer to. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why I didn&rsquo;t just answer that. No, we didn&rsquo;t cover it up.</p>
<p>Freeberg.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking me if I know what whether Pfizer did a cover up? Is that what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like?</p>
<p>Well, no, it&rsquo;s a legitimate question is what I&rsquo;m getting at.</p>
<p>Why are you unwilling to question the Pfizer CEO?</p>
<p>Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m not unwilling to question at all. But I&rsquo;m not. I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>this is a fight. Look, first of all, Pfizer is a commercial enterprise. So they have the</p>
<p>incentive to make money 100%. Right. So their objective is to sell a vaccine. I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making 10 to $15 billion on this vaccine this year. You&rsquo;re absolutely right that the economic</p>
<p>incentive is there for Pfizer to continue to push and rationalize the sales of this vaccine.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the vaccine waned very quickly. As this virus evolved and mutated, it became</p>
<p>pretty evident pretty fast that the the rate of transmission in vaccinated people continue to go</p>
<p>up. And you know, this may be a function of the quality of the vaccine or the efficacy of the</p>
<p>vaccine, more likely a function of the fact that the virus as predicted evolved. And therefore the</p>
<p>antibodies that that are produced and the T cell response that that&rsquo;s induced by the original</p>
<p>vaccine becomes less efficacious over time. So the real question is a policy question, a behavioral</p>
<p>question. But look, Pfizer didn&rsquo;t have another product to sell. So it certainly makes sense for</p>
<p>them to continue to sell their product. And there is still good data that represents that there is</p>
<p>some immune response and some benefit in certain populations to continuing to get a booster and</p>
<p>all this stuff with the original. Yeah, let me ask you about the data. The fact that that Pfizer</p>
<p>only has this product to sell is not exactly a ringing endorsement of their behavior. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stay on the data for a second. There was a study in nature, which is, you know, one of the most</p>
<p>preeminent scientific journals about the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, which is basically</p>
<p>inflammation of the heart tissue, which can basically lead to heart attacks, saying that the</p>
<p>risk among young people, especially young men, in 18 to 24 years was elevated. If they got the</p>
<p>vaccine, this was a study out of France. So it&rsquo;s pretty clear that the vaccine wasn&rsquo;t as efficacious</p>
<p>as we thought, but is it less safe than we thought as well? I generally I don&rsquo;t know the answer to</p>
<p>this. I would like to know, it&rsquo;s an important question. And there&rsquo;s a lot of work being done</p>
<p>to uncover it. And here&rsquo;s a link to a paper that was published in the journal circulation is the</p>
<p>name of the journal, not too long ago, by a team led by a researcher at Mass General. And what this</p>
<p>and so just to address the myocarditis question. And just so everyone that&rsquo;s listening knows,</p>
<p>I take a very objective view on all this stuff. I don&rsquo;t have a strong bias one way or the other.</p>
<p>So the Mass General team identified 16 people that had myocarditis that were vaccinated and</p>
<p>45 people that didn&rsquo;t work part of their control group. And they tried to understand what the</p>
<p>difference was between these two groups. There have historically been three kind of theories</p>
<p>about why there is incidence of myocarditis in certain populations that get the COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>And by the way, the incidence rate is still typically less than two out of every 100,000</p>
<p>people that get the vaccine. But as you saw in the paper you just shared, and others have</p>
<p>validated it, it can be as high as 30 times more likely to happen in young people that take the</p>
<p>Moderna vaccine, which is still a low incidence, but but 30 times higher is significant and worth</p>
<p>worth understanding. So the three kind of reasons are the three ideas 30 times higher. That sounds</p>
<p>like a lot. Yeah. So the reason and also small base, but yes. And so the three ideas are the</p>
<p>three theories around why this is happening. Number one is what&rsquo;s called protein mimicry,</p>
<p>where certain people, the protein on their, their heart tissue, for example, or certain proteins</p>
<p>found in the cells in their heart tissue, maybe look like the some element of the spike protein</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s created by the vaccine. Therefore, when you make antibodies to bind to and clear your</p>
<p>body of spike protein, it&rsquo;s also binding to your own cells and causing an auto immune response.</p>
<p>And those are called kind of auto antibodies. The second is just general immune system activation</p>
<p>that maybe genetically some people are predisposed to having a very active immune</p>
<p>system in response to the vaccine, and therefore with a very active immune system, they get</p>
<p>inflammation and damage. And then the third is this idea that there&rsquo;s just massive proliferation</p>
<p>of your B cells, some of which have auto antibodies, and some of which therefore</p>
<p>destroy your heart tissue and cause this inflammation. So what this team did is they</p>
<p>looked at the blood difference between people that had myocarditis and people that didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they found no auto antibodies, they found no big changes in the T or B cell populations,</p>
<p>meaning that there isn&rsquo;t a big immune system activation difference. The big difference that</p>
<p>they found was that the people that had myocarditis actually had a lot of the spike protein</p>
<p>floating around in their blood, whereas the people that didn&rsquo;t did not have the spike protein</p>
<p>floating around in their blood. So this answers one question, but but opens up many more doors,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s really going on. So if you have spike protein in your blood,</p>
<p>and your body&rsquo;s not clearing it, right? Well, how long after getting vaccinated,</p>
<p>were the spike proteins still floating around? Because I remember when the MRN vaccine first</p>
<p>came out, they said it was the spike proteins would go away after a couple of days, three weeks,</p>
<p>three weeks, have they done a study like, you know, six months after a year after?</p>
<p>Not yet. But that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s being done right now. So what they&rsquo;re identifying is what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with the immune system of these this population, where their body is not able to clear the spike</p>
<p>protein. And when their body doesn&rsquo;t clear the spike protein, a bunch of cytokines and other</p>
<p>inflammatory things start to get released. And it causes inflammation on the heart tissue.</p>
<p>Because, you know, there&rsquo;s a particular reason,</p>
<p>Jake, I&rsquo;ll ask you, I remember, I remember when, you know, the vaccine first came out.</p>
<p>I remember Rogan almost got canceled for saying that if he was a young person, a young man,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like 50. So he got vaccinated. But he said that if I was a young person, in my 20s,</p>
<p>I would not get vaccinated. Because I don&rsquo;t think the risk return makes sense.</p>
<p>And he almost got canceled for that. Was Rogan right about that?</p>
<p>So, you know, I have been thinking a lot about this decision to get vaccinated or not,</p>
<p>and how we came to that decision. And then I think what Freebrook said earlier is super interesting.</p>
<p>The because the virus mutated, the efficacy of these vaccines obviously changed and wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessary. And so I think it was a moving target to understand if you should take it or not,</p>
<p>it was a very personal decision. Clearly, for people who were over 65 years old,</p>
<p>the chances of dying was were pretty significant. For people under that a certain age, it was lower.</p>
<p>So everybody had to make a very personal decision here.</p>
<p>Was it a personal decision when you had vaccine mandates? And then on top of that,</p>
<p>on top of that, you had the media were dunking on anti-vaxxers throughout 2021. Remember that? I</p>
<p>mean, they were saying about anti-vaxxers that that if you didn&rsquo;t get the vaccine, you got sick,</p>
<p>there wouldn&rsquo;t be a hospital bed for you. There was, you know, a lot of like dancing on the</p>
<p>graves of these people. Yeah, where you know, there were like all these articles, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be like some preacher who, you know, said don&rsquo;t get vaccinated, and then they would die of</p>
<p>COVID. And there&rsquo;s a lot of like morbid sort of ghoulish like articles dancing on their graves.</p>
<p>I mean, it was not this objective personal decision. There was tremendous</p>
<p>social and legal pressure to get vaccinated. You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Was it? You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>There was and I think part of the reason I myself got vaccinated was because I wanted to be able to</p>
<p>travel again. I wanted to be able to go to Madison Square Garden and watch the Knicks.</p>
<p>And I also thought, well, I don&rsquo;t want to be if I&rsquo;m overweight, like one of the people who</p>
<p>dies from this. So, you know, we all sat here, we all got vaccinated. Do we regret our decision</p>
<p>to get vaccinated? Now that we see this, you know, studies like maybe it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>
<p>And also, it was apparently oversold. So when the Pfizer CEO won&rsquo;t say when they knew it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to stop transmission, I think it&rsquo;s a valid question to investigate what Pfizer knew and when</p>
<p>and just keep everybody accountable for this for future things that happen. Because right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a position where if Pfizer is not being honest with us, if the origin story of COVID isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>being honest with us, these conspiracy theories are now starting to start to look like reality.</p>
<p>Let me go to your mouth. I mean, so we were all felt this tremendous pressure in 2021,</p>
<p>to get the vaccine, right? We all care about our health. You care a lot about your health.</p>
<p>We all thought we could trust the experts that the vaccine was both efficacious and safe. We</p>
<p>know it was not efficacious in the sense that they&rsquo;re telling us that we have to get revaccinated</p>
<p>every two months for it to work on safety. I don&rsquo;t want to get over my skis because we only</p>
<p>have some data. But clearly, like this myocarditis data is not good. So were we basically stampeded</p>
<p>into making a decision that was not actually good for us? And would you make that same decision today?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just lay the foundation for understanding how we got here. So</p>
<p>there are these pathways inside the FDA to get drugs approved. And if you take a normal pathway</p>
<p>for a normal drug, you&rsquo;re going to spend nine or 10 years, maybe more 1213 in some cases, and</p>
<p>more than a billion dollars to get a drug approved. And the way that it works is in phase one,</p>
<p>you do a study on toxicology, effectively, like is this safe or not safe. And you have to have</p>
<p>enough people take it. And you need to observe them for enough time, where that phase one outcome</p>
<p>essentially says this won&rsquo;t hurt people. It&rsquo;s benign. We don&rsquo;t know the mechanism of action,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s going to solve the problem, but we know that it&rsquo;s safe. And then</p>
<p>in phase two, you then try to really understand the mechanism of action. And if that works,</p>
<p>you go into phase three, where you actually scale it out, you create a double arm study,</p>
<p>you may do a control group, you may do an open label companion, you may overpower it with</p>
<p>1000s of people. And the FDA is incredibly rigorous. Okay, even down to like, it&rsquo;s incredible,</p>
<p>by the way, like how you&rsquo;re allowed to open the results. And they have all of these services that</p>
<p>make sure that you can&rsquo;t influence the results or manipulate them. It&rsquo;s incredible. The FDA has an</p>
<p>incredible process. The thing is that they also have a way to jump around that fence. And that</p>
<p>is what we use for the COVID-19 vaccines. So in a molecule, 13 years, if it&rsquo;s for a really</p>
<p>important drug, you can shorten it to six or seven with this thing called breakthrough designation</p>
<p>for a biologic 12 or 13 years. But if you get this thing called our mat, six or seven years,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re still talking years and 1000s of people, David. But then there&rsquo;s this one special</p>
<p>asterisk that exists inside the FDA called emergency use authorization. And in moments</p>
<p>of deemed emergency, you can shorten even six years down to in some cases, six, seven,</p>
<p>nine months, a year, two years, right? Are you you&rsquo;re describing operation warp speed.</p>
<p>So that emergency use authorization, fast track these vaccines to market. Now, the thing to keep</p>
<p>in mind is there are still two classes of vaccines. There are the messenger RNA vaccines,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biotech and Pfizer ones. And then there are the more regular ones that in many</p>
<p>cases, the West was dumping on AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson, as we used to, we used to</p>
<p>ship those to developing countries and say, we&rsquo;ll just keep the mRNA once you guys think Dave Chappelle</p>
<p>had this funny joke. He&rsquo;s like, I took the J&amp;J vaccine, right? But it turns out that now when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking back, the long tail of issues may actually apply to these things that were fast</p>
<p>tracked these mRNA vaccines that were fast tracked under emergency use. Why? Because of what</p>
<p>Friedberg said, this protein mimicry thing is something we don&rsquo;t understand. Now, why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we understand it? It&rsquo;s because our tools are not precise enough to exactly know when we engineer</p>
<p>these solutions, that it only binds to this specific protein. And what we&rsquo;re learning is</p>
<p>that there, these proteins are some, they&rsquo;re so similar, that there can be a little collateral</p>
<p>damage, that this other thing that looks 99% will also all of a sudden, attract this,</p>
<p>this antigen. So this is a very complicated body of problem. And because we didn&rsquo;t give it enough</p>
<p>time to bake in the wild, we&rsquo;re learning about this thing in real time. If you if we had gone</p>
<p>to what you had suggested, which is a massive masking mandate, while this stuff played out,</p>
<p>could the outcome be different? Well, we don&rsquo;t know because we didn&rsquo;t make those decisions.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what people will be debating. The last thing I&rsquo;ll say on this is specifically</p>
<p>to myocarditis. I have an interventional cardiologist in LA, I&rsquo;ve seen him every three</p>
<p>years ever since Goldie passed away, out of respect for Goldie and Cheryl, who initially</p>
<p>asked me to go, but it&rsquo;s been a great thing that I&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from him,</p>
<p>he introduced me to PCSK9 inhibitors and a bunch of things. He called me two years ago,</p>
<p>and said, Shmath, I want to do a study that or a year ago, I want to do a study that looks at</p>
<p>actually myocarditis and the the effects of this vaccine. And Nick, I don&rsquo;t know if you can just</p>
<p>throw it up, but we published something. And basically, you know, what we see, David, is that</p>
<p>for folks with myocarditis, you&rsquo;re releasing troponin. And this is a protein that you would</p>
<p>otherwise use to figure out whether you&rsquo;re having a heart attack or severe, you know, some sort of</p>
<p>heart abnormality. And so it just goes to show you that there is some collateral damage in some</p>
<p>cases. In this example, this is one case that we published, which is a 63 year old, white woman,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that implicitly so that people understand that these things really matter on</p>
<p>age, gender and race. All of the data that comes out of France really was focused on I think it</p>
<p>was 18 to 34 year old males of all racial persuasions. And we&rsquo;ve thought that this issue</p>
<p>is prevalent only in males. But we&rsquo;ve had a few cases that we&rsquo;ve talked about now that touch</p>
<p>women as well. So it&rsquo;s a complicated set of things, because our tools are not fine grained enough</p>
<p>to engineer the drug for incredible specificity. And I think that&rsquo;s the thing that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with now. And by the way, last thing. Because of all this, it probably is reasonable</p>
<p>to take a step back and have a commission that just uncovers all of this stuff. Look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had commissions for I totally agree. We need an investigation usage in baseball,</p>
<p>like if we need an investigation. This goes back, this goes back to rebel news asking</p>
<p>burla a very simple question, which is what did you know? And what did you know with respect to</p>
<p>the efficacy and safety of these vaccines, if they did not tell the public that these vaccines did</p>
<p>not work the way they were supposed to, because they want to keep minting money? That is a</p>
<p>legitimate scandal, we have a right to know. But freeberg, let me ask you a question here. I think,</p>
<p>you know, Tomas talked about this sort of sped up process to cut through red tape and get a vaccine</p>
<p>to market more quickly. I personally actually think that that kind of process is fine for</p>
<p>patients who want to assume the risk, you know, as sort of a libertarian, I support that. But I</p>
<p>go back to the fact that people in many places were not given a choice, they had to get vaccinated,</p>
<p>or they could lose their job, or their freedom to participate in society. And now we&rsquo;re finding out</p>
<p>that they may have been forced to do something that in their particular case, may not really</p>
<p>have been a great cost benefit decision for them. What do you think that the sort of impacts going</p>
<p>to be of this district? Like socially, I mean, you&rsquo;ve talked about, I think that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>decline in trust of institutional authority in the US. And that&rsquo;s a huge problem. I mean,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this going to contribute to that? Yeah, look, I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>institutional authority overreach. That&rsquo;s been building for quite some time. And you know, look,</p>
<p>I mean, you guys can go back to our first episode, and our earliest episodes, and I wasn&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been and I, I think the first time I tweeted, I tweeted about the adverse impact that</p>
<p>lockdowns could have, and we should be weighing the cost of the lockdowns against the benefit.</p>
<p>And ultimately, the benefit was zero, because we ended up accumulating, call it $10 trillion of,</p>
<p>of, you know, $4 trillion of net costs that we have to pay off at some point,</p>
<p>not to mention the economic consequences of the lockdowns. And, you know, the benefit was</p>
<p>negligible, because the virus continued to spread and evolve. And there was no way to really stop the</p>
<p>virus in its tracks. hindsight is 2020 fog of war, lawmakers made decisions. Was it the right decision?</p>
<p>Would you have made the same decision? It&rsquo;s really hard to say you feel like you&rsquo;re saving the world</p>
<p>when the world is ending, it&rsquo;s easy to kind of act with some degree of what is now viewed as</p>
<p>overreach. I do think that the mass vaccination requirement may have also been deemed overreach,</p>
<p>given the limited data that was available, and the rapid evolution that was pretty apparent in</p>
<p>the virus at the time, as well. But vaccines are required for a number of other illnesses in a</p>
<p>number of school systems around the country. You know, you start to question, I think we will start</p>
<p>to see people question whether those are appropriate. But again, those are longer studied,</p>
<p>better understood. The cost benefit analysis is much there. Yeah, actually, I think I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right that one of the costs of this policy is going to be that people will stop trusting</p>
<p>vaccination in general, even though I think that these COVID vaccines, I&rsquo;m not even sure you can</p>
<p>really call them vaccines. I mean, every other vaccine that I&rsquo;ve ever heard of completely</p>
<p>prevents that disease. The polio vaccine ended polio, the MMR vaccine ended measles, mumps,</p>
<p>and rubella. The COVID vaccine just didn&rsquo;t work. I don&rsquo;t think it was a vaccine. But I think now</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is people are going to have a lot more distrust. And there&rsquo;s a tremendous</p>
<p>amount of post activity rationalization going on where once you kind of made a statement that the</p>
<p>vaccine will stop transmission of the virus, or stop hospitalizations, and suddenly it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve made that statement with such surety, and brevity, and funded it with so much money and</p>
<p>caused such cost in doing so, at that point, you&rsquo;re too far removed to go back and say, you</p>
<p>know what, it doesn&rsquo;t. And as we&rsquo;re seeing now, the consequences of not being willing to say that</p>
<p>you were wrong, maybe far greater than the consequences of kind of continuing, or kind of,</p>
<p>you know, making this change. So it&rsquo;s, actually, that&rsquo;s a good point. All right. Final question</p>
<p>to Jake on that point. Yeah. So, I mean, Jake, I&rsquo;ll look you were dunking, or at least concern</p>
<p>trolling on anti vaxxers during this time period. Do you reconsider that? I mean, in other words,</p>
<p>everybody was saying that the anti vaxxers were these stupid, unsophisticated people?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I, I think that maybe but maybe it was the elites who were the ones suffering from</p>
<p>groupthink. I mean, look, and I put myself in this bucket, we were all herded into this idea,</p>
<p>we all took the vaccine being an early adopter of a product. And now we&rsquo;re finding out,</p>
<p>yeah, we in fairness, we said we knew this was experimental. We knew this was the first time</p>
<p>mRNA. But we also knew like a billion people had gotten them or we when we got ours, we knew</p>
<p>hundreds of millions. Hold on, let me just ask the question. So let me finish. And so I think</p>
<p>people made a risk assessment, knowing this was an experimental vaccine, knowing that the COVID</p>
<p>was mutating at the time. And yeah, it could have been oversold. Of course, that that seems</p>
<p>to be the case. All right, Nick, pull up this tweet. But you know, we need to I, I think we</p>
<p>have to look at because we had this conversation you and I have you were very much in favor of</p>
<p>everybody getting the mandate and everybody being forced to get the</p>
<p>I never supported the mandate. You did we had a conversation about that. Like if should people</p>
<p>be able to go to work? Should people go on trains and your position was on trains?</p>
<p>No, I did not support a mandate. I thought it should always be people&rsquo;s choice. I did.</p>
<p>I made the mistake. I made the mistake of believing the experts in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>I think if the last couple years have taught us anything, it&rsquo;s that they can&rsquo;t be trusted.</p>
<p>The level of distrust we should have is even greater than we thought. I never supported</p>
<p>a mandate because I thought it should be people&rsquo;s choice. Yeah. And I certainly wasn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I was dunking on the anti vaxxers. Let&rsquo;s pull up this tweet, Nick. Yeah.</p>
<p>My Lord, Trump has cronies of Fox News are killing their own constituents with this anti</p>
<p>vax nonsense. Yeah. Do you retract that? Do I retract it? I&rsquo;m trying to look at the date.</p>
<p>By the way, this is this is a tweet that Jason put out. What was the date?</p>
<p>February 4, 2022. That sex pulled up just so yeah, that was only a year ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, at this point, people were saying that, no, I get it. I get it. This is not a rare,</p>
<p>this was not a rare sentiment. But I&rsquo;m saying, hold on, just to give this content by this.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second. I&rsquo;m just reading it. This was showing the deaths of from COVID were</p>
<p>happening at a magnitude more by people who didn&rsquo;t take the vaccine. And we know the vaccine</p>
<p>was had reduced deaths. So we still know that correct. Freeberg the vaccine</p>
<p>reduce reduces the cases of deaths, correct? Yeah, this new bivalent booster, Eric Topol</p>
<p>put out a tweet, I gave you guys the link here, where he covered a paper that was done recently.</p>
<p>And the paper shows a reduction in hospitalization rate and death rate</p>
<p>for folks that are getting this new bivalent booster. So but again, that is a benefit.</p>
<p>That is the benefit. Yeah.</p>
<p>In one&rsquo;s own kind of personal safety. And there&rsquo;s a risk profile associated with that,</p>
<p>as sex is pointing out. But this notion that the vaccines stop the virus and are a true vaccine in</p>
<p>the sense of how we talk about polio and chicken pox, or smallpox and this other stuff. Not</p>
<p>equivalent. Very freeberg. Wait, that data, how long after vaccination was that data? Because I</p>
<p>thought that with respect to the vaccine, one of the big problems is that the benefits only last</p>
<p>for two months, unless you&rsquo;re willing to get revaccinated every two months. No,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really realistic. Generally speaking, this is not like a vaccine in the sense of a</p>
<p>smallpox or it&rsquo;s just a shot. It&rsquo;s a treatment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a modest muting of the effects. And it&rsquo;s one that people need to</p>
<p>take kind of a risk based decision on for one&rsquo;s personal thing. But having</p>
<p>mandates on whether or not you can go to school and whether or not you can,</p>
<p>you know, be in places and whether or not it&rsquo;s appropriate for workplace setting. There&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>high degrees of infectiousness with this ever evolving virus. The virus that we have today</p>
<p>is not the virus that we had in February of 2020. It&rsquo;s a very different virus. And</p>
<p>it has evolved to such an extent now and it&rsquo;s continuing to evolve,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very difficult to say there&rsquo;s a vaccine for this virus. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why won&rsquo;t you just say that this the so called vaccine has been a failure,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know. Hold on. We don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t know the full safety implications. Like I said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too far out of my skis on that. However, yeah, we know the efficaciousness</p>
<p>of it has been a failure for that. It doesn&rsquo;t last long enough unless you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>jabbed six times a year, which I don&rsquo;t think anybody here would do that.</p>
<p>So the thing doesn&rsquo;t work necessary because it&rsquo;s we hold on. There was a time period where</p>
<p>it was effective, correct, Friedberg, and it did reduce deaths massively. So I think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>issue that we&rsquo;re talking about here is that now the COVID strains are so weak,</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s not as necessary. But there was a time period where people were not taking</p>
<p>the vaccine. And Republicans specifically weren&rsquo;t taking the vaccine. And they were dying at a much</p>
<p>higher percentage. So it didn&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;re defying the vaccine is not getting not transferring the</p>
<p>disease. Sure, it was a failure. It didn&rsquo;t block like we thought it would, in terms of reducing</p>
<p>reducing death, it did work for a period of time, if it only lasted for two months,</p>
<p>and COVID is still around. And it&rsquo;s basically endemic, it&rsquo;s everywhere. How did the vaccine</p>
<p>make any difference whatsoever? I think now it&rsquo;s too much. But back then it wasn&rsquo;t. But you know,</p>
<p>freeberg freeberg. Is that true? What&rsquo;s the question? I&rsquo;m losing track of how long does the</p>
<p>the lowering the percentage of deaths, the benefits of it? Oh, yes, of low reducing</p>
<p>is the only last two months. Is that true? Yeah, it depends on the population. And yes,</p>
<p>there is a decline in the benefit over time, as well as the fact that the virus is evolving.</p>
<p>Those are both two, yeah, kind of independent things. And as a result, over time, you know,</p>
<p>like, yeah, we got to keep getting boosted or shots and Pfizer is making a great business out</p>
<p>of it. You&rsquo;re right. There&rsquo;s a massive economic incentive here for them and Moderna to keep this</p>
<p>great gravy train rolling. And there&rsquo;s a massive incentive for government officials, politicians</p>
<p>to continue to stand by what they said before, because otherwise, they&rsquo;re going to be called</p>
<p>wrong. And they&rsquo;re going to get beat up. And I feel like you&rsquo;re making an effort,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making an effort to stand by what you previously said. I think we should just come out</p>
<p>and say that, look, regardless of where the safety data ultimately comes out, just based on</p>
<p>efficaciousness, we can say that this thing didn&rsquo;t work. And therefore mandating it was even worse</p>
<p>thing. Because hold on, we put every we put the drug through this rapid process. And we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let people make an individual cost benefit decision. We basically herded them into this.</p>
<p>And at best, it didn&rsquo;t do very much. I don&rsquo;t think that that decision if you if you make</p>
<p>that conclusion, I&rsquo;m not sure that it gives us a toolkit to do better the next time. And I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all said this and Friedberg was the one that first really taught us about this, there will be</p>
<p>a next time, unfortunately. So I think that we have to focus our energy here in acknowledging that</p>
<p>the tools that we have to create these messenger RNA vaccines, and other types of solutions,</p>
<p>we are pushing the boundaries of science and the body is still very poorly understood.</p>
<p>And so the sensitivity and specificity of these drugs may not be what we think up front. And as</p>
<p>a result of that, maybe we need to find a different way of using emergency use authorization in the</p>
<p>future. And I don&rsquo;t know, David, to your point, I&rsquo;m beyond my ski tips on scientific</p>
<p>knowledge to know how</p>
<p>I would say as a minimum, that if we&rsquo;re going to do emergency use, it shouldn&rsquo;t be mandated.</p>
<p>Let patients sign on. Okay, let&rsquo;s move on. So we have a moment of agreement question for freebird.</p>
<p>Would you advise or in your life? Would you would you continue to get a booster? Or are you going</p>
<p>to consider getting a booster every year now if they can come with them? And now would you advise</p>
<p>parents or you know, adults over 65 or 70 to get one because those seem to be the high risk group,</p>
<p>right? So if your parents said should I get it or not? I would advise advise them to talk to</p>
<p>their doctor and their doctor would advise them to do it. What do you think most doctors would tell</p>
<p>somebody above 65 or 70? At this point? It depends what state they&rsquo;re in at this point. But</p>
<p>it basically would be split on political lines. Unless this virus turns into Ebola,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never getting boosted again. I&rsquo;ll tell you that right now. I do agrees. What about you guys?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting boosted again. No, I&rsquo;m not getting I think that speaks volumes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s volumes right there. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s it. Like we could have just done this in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>What about guys? We are literally not this. I don&rsquo;t know. Let&rsquo;s move on. Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Freeberg but the fact that all of us can arrive at that and then we&rsquo;re worried about getting banned</p>
<p>tells you how screwed up our society is like you&rsquo;re right what we can&rsquo;t like have an honest</p>
<p>conversation about this. By the way, the other thing this is going to do it&rsquo;s going to inflame</p>
<p>a large number of people just hearing us say this and it because people have these deep what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened is this has now become a sense of identity, a sense of tribalism and a sense of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a belief system. It&rsquo;s no longer about an objective decision. Well, we saw this with the</p>
<p>mass. The mass became the blue became the blue equivalent of the red. So now the vaccine is</p>
<p>basically, you know, it&rsquo;s become tribal, but but but people need to move beyond that because this</p>
<p>is a scientific question of cost and benefits related to this medical treatment. Okay, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just move on. There&rsquo;s too much to talk about. There&rsquo;s not for venture capitalists about your</p>
<p>vaccine plan. Yeah, speak to please don&rsquo;t listen to us. All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s move on. You are by the way, by the way, speak to your doctor. And just remember,</p>
<p>vaccine manufacturers have a business to run and politicians have to get reelected.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s move on because we&rsquo;ve gotten stuck on this. Okay, look, there&rsquo;s been some</p>
<p>important developments in Ukraine. I think we should just cover quickly this week. There were</p>
<p>a bunch of things the Biden administration said they&rsquo;re going to send Abrams tanks as well as</p>
<p>Bradley&rsquo;s and leopard twos. The Abrams tank in particular is our best most expensive tank.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, they said they would not send them. So they reversed their decision on</p>
<p>that. Now the Ukrainians are saying they want jets as well. That&rsquo;s sort of the next issue that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to come up. The Biden administration also in a New York Times article that came out earlier</p>
<p>this week, said that they were warming to the idea of supporting an invasion of Crimea.</p>
<p>Some Europeans like Peter Hitchens are getting very nervous about this level of escalation. He</p>
<p>had a pretty amazing piece talking about the risk of this creating nuclear war. And even if the</p>
<p>Ukrainians prevail in this war, there was a really interesting statement by Larry Fink at Davos last</p>
<p>week saying that he estimated the cost of reconstruction at $750 billion. And Fitch</p>
<p>Ratings Agency says that Ukraine is headed towards default. So major, major developments, I think in</p>
<p>the war this week, I want to get your guys opinion on this. We know from history that wars tend to</p>
<p>escalate and to be far more costly than the participants ever thought. Is that the track</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on now? And in hindsight, knowing what we know now, should we regret that we didn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>every diplomatic tool we had to prevent the war, most notably taking NATO expansion off the table?</p>
<p>Freeberg, I&rsquo;ll go to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a tough situation.</p>
<p>Is the situation escalating to a point where we should be concerned?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of information we don&rsquo;t have. And there&rsquo;s a lot of intelligence gathering</p>
<p>and conversations and chatter that we&rsquo;re not privy to. So to sit here and kind of be an</p>
<p>armchair mechanic, I don&rsquo;t know what diplomatic conversations have gone on or are going on.</p>
<p>All I know is what we&rsquo;re reading on the internet, right? So I&rsquo;m not nobody.</p>
<p>This war is extremely well covered. And there are no diplomatic conversations going on.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I think we&rsquo;re escalating the war. I mean, let me get Jay Keller Chamath in here.</p>
<p>Do you guys have any concerns about the direction this is headed at all?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m concerned. I also agree with Freeberg that I don&rsquo;t think we have all the information.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what we can do right now. It&rsquo;s it seems like they have decided</p>
<p>that there is a play to exert a lot of pressure come the spring. And that&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>mentioned as a very likely thing. And so I guess the calculus on the ground is that there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to really push Russia into a corner. And the only way to do that is with more military support.</p>
<p>And then on the heels of that, David, the link that you sent is then it&rsquo;s not just the war</p>
<p>machine that is now spinning up, but it&rsquo;s the aftermarket financial services infrastructure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also spinning up or Larry, Larry Fink, you mean the grift aspect of this war?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, where Larry Fink was like, hey, they&rsquo;re going to need three quarters of a</p>
<p>trillion dollars of reconstruction support. We saw that play out in Iraq as well, where at first,</p>
<p>it was the war machine, and then it was the reconstruction machine. And together, it was</p>
<p>trillions and trillions. Those are called infrastructure funds. And those infrastructure</p>
<p>funds raise hundreds of billions of dollars to make investments to build new infrastructure</p>
<p>in markets that need it and that are willing to pay for it. And it will likely end up being kind</p>
<p>of long term debt assumed by that region to pay to do this work and the beneficiaries will be the</p>
<p>investors and owners of those infrastructure funds. I think there&rsquo;s two sides to the sacks that are</p>
<p>worth kind of noting one is the telegraphing of this decision, because it&rsquo;s not being done</p>
<p>secretly, it&rsquo;s being done out in the open. There&rsquo;s certainly a calculus to that. Why are they</p>
<p>telegraphing this? And what do they intend to do with that messaging being put out there like this?</p>
<p>And it may be that it&rsquo;s to assert or assume a stronger negotiating position, certainly to go</p>
<p>into some sort of, you know, mild, modest exit or settlement coming out of this thing. But you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right, the flip side is and the cost here is one of extreme outcome, which is there may be a</p>
<p>Franz Ferdinand moment here, where one thing goes too far and triggers a cataclysmic outcome. And</p>
<p>in this case, the cataclysmic outcome is tactical nuclear weapons, and tactical nuclear weapons as</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about. And I think I&rsquo;ve I had some conversations and some dinners I shared with you</p>
<p>guys with some folks in the intelligence community. And this has been talked about by</p>
<p>ex intelligence community folks publicly are a key part of the Russian war playbook that this is</p>
<p>there is a tactical nuclear weapon response system that is in place. And you know, these are</p>
<p>very possible paths that we could find ourselves kind of walking down. Obviously, were that to</p>
<p>happen, it would be a massive escalation. And you&rsquo;re right, there could be a Franz Ferdinand</p>
<p>kind of moment that emerges by shaking the cage and lighting a fire. And there may be a stronger</p>
<p>negotiating position to get to a settlement faster by doing this. I don&rsquo;t have a strong point of view</p>
<p>on the probability of either of those and why but I think, you know, maybe both are certainly</p>
<p>in play here. Yeah, it was interesting to me that the Wall Street Journal on the heels of</p>
<p>all of this stuff also published an article about Roman Abramovich. And the interesting</p>
<p>thing about it was a quote in the article that effectively said something tantamount to well,</p>
<p>now that he&rsquo;s proven not as useful, we need to target him with sanctions.</p>
<p>So I just think that what all of this is, is now sort of they&rsquo;re entering the end game,</p>
<p>David, to use a chess analogy. And it looks like they&rsquo;re setting the wheels in motion</p>
<p>to kind of put all the pieces together for a negotiated settlement.</p>
<p>Do we know that? I mean, well, but is it a continual escalation? I mean, Jake, I actually</p>
<p>at the beginning of the war, we didn&rsquo;t want to give the Ukrainians Abrams tanks because they</p>
<p>were that was considered too provocative. Now we&rsquo;re giving them to them. I think what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on here is, and I suspected this, you know, from the beginning is that we are trying to engage them</p>
<p>in a war of attrition, and it&rsquo;s working. And so I think the West collectively is trying to further</p>
<p>that goal of just making Russia economically, politically, militarily, culturally, irrelevant,</p>
<p>or angled in some way. And if you think about what&rsquo;s now happening with energy, you know,</p>
<p>his primary export, he is going to lose those customers and his customers will be, you know,</p>
<p>bottom feeding India, China, low cost, you know, oil, and he is going to be a pariah.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m looking at is if there&rsquo;s going to be a negotiated settlement this year,</p>
<p>what is the next five or 10 years going to look like for Russia? What is their place in the world</p>
<p>going to be the West is never going to trust them again, the Germans are never going to buy their</p>
<p>oil again, everybody is going to be looking for ways to distance themselves from so how does he</p>
<p>have an exit ramp? And we talked about this from the get go here on this podcast is what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>golden bridge for him to retreat across. And we really need to find that golden bridge quickly,</p>
<p>because I do think this is starting to look desperate for him. The West keeps giving better</p>
<p>and better munitions, he keeps losing economically, he&rsquo;s going to keep losing. And politically,</p>
<p>who would ever want to engage Putin in anything with, you know, any kind of cultural or international</p>
<p>trade, it&rsquo;s going to be a disaster for him. So this war of attrition has to resolve itself with</p>
<p>some sort of settlement. But we just can&rsquo;t go on for two or three years, can it? I mean,</p>
<p>it has to settle at some point. I think that it certainly can go on. And I think that history</p>
<p>proves that wars tend to escalate and the costs incurred are much greater, in many cases,</p>
<p>than participants ever dreamed of. And if they had to go and do it all over again,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten into it in the first place. So yeah, I think this is concerning. I</p>
<p>think, you know, the crazy thing is&hellip; Do you think it is a war of attrition strategy?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it has developed into a war of attrition. And I think you&rsquo;re right that,</p>
<p>well, I think there&rsquo;s two possibilities. Do you think that was by design?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two possibilities, Jay Cal. I think that the maybe the more cynical or</p>
<p>realistic members of the administration think there&rsquo;s benefit in wearing Russia down and</p>
<p>grinding them down. However, I also think there&rsquo;s kind of a true believer camp that sees</p>
<p>pushing Russia out of Ukraine, nothing less than that will do. And we have to punish their</p>
<p>aggression. Maybe they want regime change. I think there&rsquo;s dueling factions in the administration.</p>
<p>Remember, General Milley, several months ago, said that everything that the Ukrainians could</p>
<p>achieve militarily just about had been done, and they should negotiate. And even Jake Sullivan had</p>
<p>said that they should take Crimea off the table. That was just the leaks a few months ago. Now,</p>
<p>the administration is leaking that they&rsquo;re going to support a Crimean invasion. So, I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>both schools within the administration, the true believers and the more cynical</p>
<p>folks. And it feels to me like the true believers are on top right now, because we just keep</p>
<p>escalating this war more and more. And I think that&rsquo;s dangerous. That polarizes the outcomes,</p>
<p>right? So, I think, Jay Cal, if you had your way, it sounds like you would grind the Russians down.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, you would say enough is enough. And like a poker player, like you do it</p>
<p>at the poker table, you&rsquo;d say, I won my Prius for the night. I don&rsquo;t need to risk that to win a</p>
<p>Tesla. So, I&rsquo;m going to cash in my chips and get away, walk up, walk away, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wish I could do that. I wish I could do that consistently.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Getting up from the table is a rare skill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. But I&rsquo;m not sure the administration is getting up from the table. I mean,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve achieved the American position on this, I think has largely been achieved. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>prevented Russia from taking over Ukraine. We&rsquo;ve prevented we&rsquo;ve basically shifted Europe onto</p>
<p>American natural gas. We&rsquo;ve destroyed Nord Stream. I think we&rsquo;re close to achieving our major</p>
<p>objectives. But I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re going to stop there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. Anyway, all right. Let&rsquo;s move on. Freeberg, you have a science corner.</p>
<p>I was going to share the this was last week, I think we talked about talking about it this week.</p>
<p>So there was a paper that is a pretty compelling paper published by a team led out of Harvard</p>
<p>on identifying what may be the core driver of aging and demonstration on an ability to kind of</p>
<p>reverse aging. So I&rsquo;ll just start really quickly that, you know, in the human body, we have many</p>
<p>different types of cells, right, we have 200, roughly different kinds of cells, and I sell a</p>
<p>skin cell, a brain cell, a heart cell, they all have the same DNA, the same genetic code, the same</p>
<p>genome, at the nucleus of that cell, what makes those cells different. And the reason they act</p>
<p>and behave differently, is they have different gene expression, meaning different genes in that</p>
<p>cell are turned on and off. And when a gene is turned on, the protein that that gene codes for</p>
<p>is expressed and made in the cell. And the genes that are off those proteins are not made. And</p>
<p>remember, proteins are the biochemical machines in biology. So when certain proteins are produced,</p>
<p>they do stuff and other proteins don&rsquo;t do stuff. And the cell acts and behaves very differently.</p>
<p>So some cells, when you turn genes on and off, you get a neuron, some cells, you turn them on and</p>
<p>off, you get a muscle cell in your bicep, some of them, you get a heart cell. And so all of these</p>
<p>cells are differentiated by the genes that are expressed. The general term for the expression</p>
<p>of genes is the epigenome. And an epigenome basically refers to these systems whereby</p>
<p>certain parts of the DNA, certain segments of genes are uncoiled a little bit. So if you zoom</p>
<p>in on DNA, you know, there&rsquo;s 23 chromosomes, they&rsquo;re tightly wrapped in these coils. And when</p>
<p>you go even closer, you see that there&rsquo;s these segments called nucleosomes. And a nucleosome</p>
<p>means it&rsquo;s like a bead, and a bunch of DNA is wrapped around the bead. And how closely those</p>
<p>beads are together, how much the DNA is wrapped, allows a segment of the DNA to be opened up,</p>
<p>and then expressed, meaning copies of the DNA are turned into RNA, which floats into this thing</p>
<p>called the ribosome. And the ribosome is the protein printer. So the more these little segments</p>
<p>of genome are exposed, the more they&rsquo;re expressed. And there are certain chemicals, these methyls and</p>
<p>acetyls that kind of attach to the genome, and certain elements that allow parts of the</p>
<p>chromosome to wrap up and get really tightly bound, or to unwrap and to express the gene.</p>
<p>So the epigenome is almost you can think about it like the software, and the genome or the DNA</p>
<p>is the hardware. And so the hardware basically defines what you can make. The epigenome defines</p>
<p>what is being made, what stuff is turned on and what stuff is turned off. So this paper and this</p>
<p>work that was done, historically, we&rsquo;ve always thought that aging meant that over time, the DNA</p>
<p>in our cells was mutating, and errors were accumulating in the DNA. And as a result of those</p>
<p>errors, the cells start to dysfunction. And what these guys really did a good job of proving with</p>
<p>this paper is that it may not be mutations in the DNA that&rsquo;s causing aging, but actually changes in</p>
<p>the epigenome, and that the DNA remains pretty stable and pretty consistent over time. And the</p>
<p>way they did this is they broke the DNA. And just so you guys know, every second of your life,</p>
<p>about a million breaks in DNA in cells throughout your body are happening, your DNA is being broken</p>
<p>up. And then there&rsquo;s all this machinery in your cell that fixes the DNA when it breaks. Now,</p>
<p>what happens when it fixes it, it turns out it&rsquo;s actually really good at fixing it, and the DNA</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t change. And we historically thought that the DNA changed a lot, and mutations accumulate</p>
<p>over time. But in reality, what may be happening is as your DNA gets fixed, the epigenome, the</p>
<p>acetyl and methyl groups on the gene on the chromosome, don&rsquo;t get put in the right place.</p>
<p>And over time, what happens is the epigenome degrades. And this is considered and a lot of</p>
<p>people refer to this now as the information theory of aging, you can kind of think about</p>
<p>making a lot of copies of software, a lot of copies of a photo in a photo printer over time.</p>
<p>And every time you make a copy, there&rsquo;s a little error, a little error, and those errors accumulate.</p>
<p>And the errors that accumulate cause the epigenome to change. And as a result, certain genes are</p>
<p>turned on that are supposed to be off. And certain genes are turned off that are supposed to be</p>
<p>turned on. And then those cells start to get dysfunctional, because the wrong proteins are</p>
<p>being made in the cell can no longer do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. So what these guys</p>
<p>could be the ribosome as well that gets screwed up over time, the printer,</p>
<p>the ribosome is a pretty, you know, static protein, it just does its thing. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hundreds of ribosomes in a cell. So you know, if one of them&rsquo;s dysfunctional, it just doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything. And then the other ones kind of step in and do it. So the ribosomes are constantly running.</p>
<p>What these guys did is they basically took two mice, two populations of mice, and they gave the</p>
<p>one population of mice a certain thing that caused its DNA to break at three times the rate of the</p>
<p>other population. And then as the DNA broke, they could, they could see that this mouse population</p>
<p>got older and older faster. And by a bunch of measures on how do you measure age, but what they</p>
<p>did is they then measured they then sequence the DNA of the two populations of mice. And what they</p>
<p>showed is that the older mice, the ones that had their DNA changing a lot, by the way, these were</p>
<p>genetically identical mice, the ones that had their DNA broken a lot more, they had the correct</p>
<p>genome, their genome was the exact same as the other mice that stayed young. And so what that</p>
<p>tells us is that it&rsquo;s the epigenome and not the DNA itself that&rsquo;s changing. So then here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they did. Remember, last year, we talked about Yamanaka factors, which are these four proteins,</p>
<p>these four molecules that can be applied to DNA to a cell, and they cause all of the gene expression</p>
<p>to reset back to looking like a stem cell. And remember, all of those differentiated cells come</p>
<p>from a stem cell. And when they did that, the older population of mice suddenly started to act</p>
<p>younger, and all of the measures of age reversed. And they did this across different tissue types,</p>
<p>they measure this in a lot of different ways, cognitive function, health, cellular health,</p>
<p>etc. And so it is not just a fantastic new proof point of how Yamanaka factors can actually reverse</p>
<p>age. But it demonstrates that the epigenome itself is what is the core driver of aging.</p>
<p>And you guys remember Alto&rsquo;s labs raised $3 billion in a seed round last year. And remember,</p>
<p>at the end of 21, I said, like Yamanaka factors and aging research is going to be kind of the</p>
<p>next hot thing. I think this paper is going to be one of the seminal papers that really kind of</p>
<p>illustrates and proves the point that this epigenome is the driver of aging. And as we</p>
<p>now are investing a lot of money in figuring out how Yamanaka factors and other transcription</p>
<p>factors like the Yamanaka factors can be applied in specific ways to actually reverse aging and</p>
<p>cause the cells to start functioning correctly again. And then people will start to act and</p>
<p>resolve in a healthy way. Once again, there&rsquo;s a lot of work to go between here and there. But</p>
<p>now we have a much more kind of definitive proof point that this information theory of aging may be</p>
<p>real, that it&rsquo;s tied to the epigenome, and that there are solutions that can work. And we have</p>
<p>to figure out how to put them together and how to engineer a fantastic outcome. So really great</p>
<p>paper, by a team led out of Harvard, I think really validates a lot of the work and the money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going into the space, both in the public and the private sector. And obviously, a lot of</p>
<p>new startups kind of chasing this opportunity to figure out how we can use these transcription</p>
<p>factors to reverse aging, and that this may end up leading us to, you know, a much kind of healthy</p>
<p>life. And by the way, when they applied those Yamanaka factors to the mice, the mice lived 107%</p>
<p>longer than they were supposed to. But more importantly, the health span as it&rsquo;s defined,</p>
<p>improved. So the mice not only lived longer, but they actually lived healthier. They&rsquo;re all the</p>
<p>measures of healthiness in the body improved. So it&rsquo;s a really kind of free is going to help us in</p>
<p>the next 10 years. It may Yeah, it&rsquo;s very well made. There are now some there. I feel like</p>
<p>science quarter should only discuss things that can happen in the next few years. Let&rsquo;s put it</p>
<p>that way. Or is that the wrong way to look at it? I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;ll tell you one way, one thing</p>
<p>for sure, you can make you can make money as an investor over the next 10 years in finding the</p>
<p>right teams that are going to have the highest likelihood of progressing clinical trials in this</p>
<p>space. I will say that there may be clinical trials that can come to market really fast,</p>
<p>particularly with kind of these ex vivo therapeutics, where you take cells out of your</p>
<p>body, apply the Yamanaka factors, and then put them back in your body for certain tissue types,</p>
<p>like I cells, for example, or T cells in your blood. There&rsquo;s a lot of ways that this may come</p>
<p>to market faster. And it&rsquo;s not just about reversing your age overall, but reversing the</p>
<p>age of certain cell types in your body that can then have profound health impacts in the near</p>
<p>term. So that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that&rsquo;s going to start to come through clinical stage sooner than</p>
<p>later. And then maybe, you know, some number of years down the road, we figure out a way to reverse</p>
<p>the age and all the cells in our body, and the whole body becomes more youthful. But for now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be targeted cells in a very specific way to reverse aging and improve health. Very</p>
<p>powerful, very interesting. Lots of investment opportunity. And, you know, certainly some,</p>
<p>some very smart folks. What do you think the realistic time frame is for like, you know,</p>
<p>reversing aging? Because we need that. 30 years. But I think I&rsquo;ll be 80.</p>
<p>No, but that can be close. But so if we live to 80, does that mean we&rsquo;re gonna be able to like</p>
<p>live to 100? Because we&rsquo;ll be able to like reverse age? Well,</p>
<p>can you live well to 100? I think that&rsquo;s the question. We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if you could reverse aging,</p>
<p>yeah, but we don&rsquo;t know what that means. Because there&rsquo;s all kinds of things that you inherit over</p>
<p>time, that this may not for example, like if you have long term heart disease, I could see how the</p>
<p>cells could get healthier, but it can&rsquo;t eliminate the plaque in your arteries. Right? You know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a part of calcium. That shit&rsquo;s there. So you have to live well. Same with Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>like Alzheimer&rsquo;s has plaque, there&rsquo;s a plaque element, but the cause of that and the cellular</p>
<p>dysfunction may be reversible. It could definitely be that like injury rates of older people,</p>
<p>hips, knees, shoulders, arms, all the sort of like soft musculoskeletal stuff,</p>
<p>you can you can really do a good job of because at the same time as you get older, like</p>
<p>people to intake less protein, they process it less well, you lose a lot of muscle mass as you</p>
<p>get older. Those are things that I think are like short term solutions. But no, to be honest with</p>
<p>you, sacks, the stuff that really can screw you, which is heart disease and brain function,</p>
<p>this probably won&rsquo;t do much for a long time. So check out screwed. Yeah, I&rsquo;m in the best shape</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in 20 years. I feel great. I&rsquo;m getting your verse, whatever&rsquo;s wrong with Jay Keller is</p>
<p>not in the category. I got an email, we all got it from a guy who I won&rsquo;t say just about not to</p>
<p>violate his privacy, privacy. But he&rsquo;s in Saskatchewan, he listens to the pod or his father</p>
<p>is and made him get a prenuval scan. Oh, flu flew the father to Vancouver, they found a five</p>
<p>centimeter cancerous tumor on his kidney. And three days ago had it removed and looks like</p>
<p>guys totally healthy and well, eliminated. Here&rsquo;s thing. So another live saved the pod,</p>
<p>but but I wanted to show you guys a picture. So yesterday, I went to Los Angeles to see my</p>
<p>interventional cardiologist. And what they do is they do the what&rsquo;s called a contrast CT scan. So</p>
<p>they put you into an IV. And they put this contrast inside of you, Nick, you want to put</p>
<p>throw the picture up, please. And then they use all the software to actually create an extremely</p>
<p>accurate 3d model of your heart. And what they can do is go inside of your arteries and actually</p>
<p>measure the calcium buildup. I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before this, this is a service called heart flow,</p>
<p>h e, a, r, t, f, l, o, w. In any event, my calcium score is still zero, thank God touch wood,</p>
<p>keep grinding. But I just wanted to put this out there for anybody who has a history of heart</p>
<p>disease in their family for them, or for their parents, or what have you. If you go and ask your</p>
<p>doctor, this is a third party service that they can do it, you go get a contrast CT. And you can</p>
<p>get a very accurate sense of your heart health. This is amazing. They, they found it&rsquo;s incredible,</p>
<p>they found that you have a heart. They did find that I have a heart. This is this is incredible</p>
<p>technology. Because we would try to find if you had a heart for all this 112 episodes. Dr.</p>
<p>Carlsberg was shocked. They found a heart. It looked huge. It looked like secretariat.</p>
<p>I do have a big heart boys, as you guys know. No, I mean, this is shocking for the audience.</p>
<p>size, that can&rsquo;t be actual size.</p>
<p>His heart&rsquo;s bigger than his brain. He&rsquo;s got a big heart.</p>
<p>Glad you&rsquo;re healthy, bestie. That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>So go get go get a heart flow. If anybody has heart disease, go talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>All right. Well, for David Sachs,</p>
<p>was it was a moderation? Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, listen, it was funny as if you were doing a Jekyll. All right,</p>
<p>fairness. I&rsquo;ll come back to moderate next week. I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, I would give</p>
<p>both the Davids a robotic b minus c plus. I think they&rsquo;re better off opining than moderating. Okay.</p>
<p>And I think that Jason really doesn&rsquo;t have anything interesting to say. So he&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>off moderating. Like my comments last week. And then we can minimize the number of times</p>
<p>he finds any random way to take it back to virtue signaling and genuflecting about China.</p>
<p>I was gonna ask Jason, what he thought about the Cowboys 49ers game where</p>
<p>Kittle was an ineligible downfield receiver, and they didn&rsquo;t call a penalty. Very important</p>
<p>catch for that game that again, the Cowboys now losing every single time they get to the playoffs.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t want to ask you because I was I thought that you&rsquo;d veer it toward</p>
<p>Xi Jinping and some China comment. No.</p>
<p>Any genuflecting would you like to do before you go back to your</p>
<p>I will admit that the moderation thing is harder than it looks.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s harder than it looks to be entertaining. I think that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Thank you. Plus, a plus moderator, get back to your job.</p>
<p>I will, I will come back next week and moderate. I have been under the weather.</p>
<p>Pass the ball and let and let us put the ball in the basket.</p>
<p>I will put the ball exactly where you each like it.</p>
<p>Perfectly. Look for some great assists coming next week with Jake. I was back at 100% strength.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Davids for filling in for me for the last two weeks,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see you all next time.</p>
<p>Going on.</p>
<p>Like this, like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
