    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a theoretical physicist at Caltech</p>
<p>specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of several popular books,</p>
<p>one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here,</p>
<p>one on the Higgs boson called Particle</p>
<p>at the End of the Universe,</p>
<p>and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture</p>
<p>on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself.</p>
<p>He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics</p>
<p>that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden.</p>
<p>He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website,</p>
<p>preposterousuniverse.com.</p>
<p>I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link</p>
<p>that lists accessible, interesting posts</p>
<p>on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy,</p>
<p>the Big Bang, general relativity,</p>
<p>string theory, quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science,</p>
<p>God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most famously,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the host of a podcast called Mindscape</p>
<p>that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.</p>
<p>Along with the Joe Rogan experience,</p>
<p>Sam Harris&rsquo;s Making Sense,</p>
<p>and Dan Carlin&rsquo;s Hardcore History,</p>
<p>Sean&rsquo;s Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways</p>
<p>to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives</p>
<p>and ideas that I thought I understood.</p>
<p>It was truly an honor to meet</p>
<p>and spend a couple hours with Sean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit heartbreaking to say</p>
<p>that for the first time ever,</p>
<p>the audio recorder for this podcast</p>
<p>died in the middle of our conversation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s technical reasons for this,</p>
<p>having to do with phantom power</p>
<p>that I now understand and will avoid.</p>
<p>It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem.</p>
<p>So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy,</p>
<p>roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost,</p>
<p>except in the memories of the two people involved</p>
<p>and in my notes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk again and continue this conversation</p>
<p>on this podcast or on Sean&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And of course, I look forward to it.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>What do you think is more interesting and impactful,</p>
<p>understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level</p>
<p>or understanding how the human mind works?</p>
<p>You know, of course this is a crazy,</p>
<p>meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both very interesting</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no absolute scale of interestingness</p>
<p>that we can rate them on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a glib answer that says the human brain</p>
<p>is part of the universe, right?</p>
<p>And therefore, understanding the universe</p>
<p>is more fundamental than understanding the human brain.</p>
<p>But do you really believe that once we understand</p>
<p>the fundamental way the universe works</p>
<p>at the particle level, the forces,</p>
<p>we would be able to understand how the mind works?</p>
<p>No, certainly not.</p>
<p>We cannot understand how ice cream works</p>
<p>just from understanding how particles work, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big believer in emergence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer that there are different ways</p>
<p>of talking about the world</p>
<p>beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one.</p>
<p>You know, when we talk about tables and chairs</p>
<p>and planets and people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking the language of particle physics</p>
<p>and cosmology.</p>
<p>So, but understanding the universe,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t say just at the most fundamental level, right?</p>
<p>So understanding the universe at all levels</p>
<p>is part of that.</p>
<p>I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair</p>
<p>to the question, there probably are general principles</p>
<p>of complexity, biology, information processing,</p>
<p>memory, knowledge, creativity</p>
<p>that go beyond just the human brain, right?</p>
<p>And maybe one could count understanding those</p>
<p>as part of understanding the universe.</p>
<p>The human brain, as far as we know,</p>
<p>is the most complex thing in the universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s certainly absurd to think</p>
<p>that by understanding the fundamental laws</p>
<p>of particle physics,</p>
<p>you get any direct insight on how the brain works.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this step from the fundamentals</p>
<p>of particle physics to information processing,</p>
<p>which a lot of physicists and philosophers</p>
<p>may be a little bit carelessly take</p>
<p>when they talk about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Do you think of the universe</p>
<p>as a kind of a computational device?</p>
<p>No, to be like, the honest answer there is no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which the universe</p>
<p>processes information, clearly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which the universe</p>
<p>is like a computer, clearly.</p>
<p>But in some sense, I think,</p>
<p>I tried to say this once on my blog</p>
<p>and no one agreed with me,</p>
<p>but the universe is more like a computation</p>
<p>than a computer because the universe happens once.</p>
<p>A computer is a general purpose machine, right?</p>
<p>That you can ask it different questions,</p>
<p>even a pocket calculator, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s set up to answer certain kinds of questions.</p>
<p>The universe isn&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>So information processing happens in the universe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not what the universe is.</p>
<p>And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd,</p>
<p>feels very differently about this, right?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re thinking of the universe as a closed system.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>So what makes a computer more like a PC,</p>
<p>like a computing machine is that there&rsquo;s a human</p>
<p>that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around.</p>
<p>So input.</p>
<p>Gives it input.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s just a computation,</p>
<p>a deterministic thing that&rsquo;s just unrolling.</p>
<p>But the immense complexity of it</p>
<p>is nevertheless like processing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a state and then it changes with good rules.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense for a lot of people</p>
<p>that if the brain operates,</p>
<p>the human brain operates within that world,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s simply just a small subset of that.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no reason we can&rsquo;t build</p>
<p>arbitrarily great intelligences.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think of intelligence in this way?</p>
<p>Intelligence is tricky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a definition of it offhand.</p>
<p>So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel.</p>
<p>And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist.</p>
<p>And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer</p>
<p>and explained this.</p>
<p>And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer?</p>
<p>And Seth was like, oh, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition</p>
<p>of what a computer is, then everything is, right?</p>
<p>And the simile or the analogy gains force</p>
<p>when it excludes some things.</p>
<p>You know, is the moon going around the earth</p>
<p>performing a computation?</p>
<p>I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a very useful computation.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s absolutely helpful</p>
<p>to think about the universe in certain situations,</p>
<p>certain contexts, as an information processing device.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m even guilty of writing a paper</p>
<p>called Quantum Circuit Cosmology,</p>
<p>where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit.</p>
<p>As a circuit.</p>
<p>As a circuit, yeah.</p>
<p>With qubits kind of thing?</p>
<p>With qubits basically, right, yeah.</p>
<p>So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled.</p>
<p>So do we wanna digress a little bit?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a mystery about the universe</p>
<p>that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it.</p>
<p>Space expands, right?</p>
<p>And we talk about, in a certain region of space,</p>
<p>a certain number of degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>a certain number of ways that the quantum fields</p>
<p>and the particles in that region can arrange themselves.</p>
<p>That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space</p>
<p>is arguably finite.</p>
<p>We actually don&rsquo;t know how many there are,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a very good argument</p>
<p>that says it&rsquo;s a finite number.</p>
<p>So as the universe expands and space gets bigger,</p>
<p>are there more degrees of freedom?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an infinite number, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Infinity times two is still infinity.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s a finite number, then there&rsquo;s more space,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s more degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>So where did they come from?</p>
<p>That would mean the universe is not a closed system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more degrees of freedom popping into existence.</p>
<p>So what we suggested was</p>
<p>that there are more degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re not there to start,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not entangled to start.</p>
<p>So the universe that you and I know of,</p>
<p>the three dimensions around us that we see,</p>
<p>we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom</p>
<p>making up space time.</p>
<p>And as the universe expands,</p>
<p>there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state</p>
<p>that become entangled with the rest of space time</p>
<p>through the action of these quantum circuits.</p>
<p>So what does it mean that there&rsquo;s now more</p>
<p>degrees of freedom as they become more entangled?</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>As the universe expands.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, so there&rsquo;s more and more degrees of freedom</p>
<p>that are entangled, that are playing part,</p>
<p>playing the role of part</p>
<p>of the entangled space time structure.</p>
<p>So the basic, the underlying philosophy is</p>
<p>that space time itself arises from the entanglement</p>
<p>of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Wow, okay, so at which point</p>
<p>is most of the entanglement happening?</p>
<p>Are we talking about close to the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Are we talking about throughout the time of the life?</p>
<p>Throughout history, yeah.</p>
<p>So the idea is that at the Big Bang,</p>
<p>almost all the degrees of freedom</p>
<p>that the universe could have were there,</p>
<p>but they were unentangled with anything else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a reflection of the fact</p>
<p>that the Big Bang had a low entropy.</p>
<p>It was a very simple, very small place.</p>
<p>And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom</p>
<p>become entangled with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Well, I have to ask John Carroll,</p>
<p>what do you think of the thought experiment</p>
<p>from Nick Bostrom that we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more.</p>
<p>I think people don&rsquo;t actually take this thought experiments.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very useful, but it&rsquo;s quite interesting.</p>
<p>From the perspective of AI,</p>
<p>a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens</p>
<p>in simulation from artificial examples.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a constructive question to ask,</p>
<p>how difficult is our real world to simulate?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which is kind of a dual part of,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re living in a simulation</p>
<p>and somebody built that simulation,</p>
<p>if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be?</p>
<p>So obviously we could be living in a simulation.</p>
<p>If you just want the physical possibility,</p>
<p>then I completely agree that it&rsquo;s physically possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we actually are.</p>
<p>So take this one piece of data into consideration.</p>
<p>You know, we live in a big universe, okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two trillion galaxies in our observable universe</p>
<p>with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera.</p>
<p>It would seem to be a waste of resources</p>
<p>to have a universe that big going on</p>
<p>just to do a simulation.</p>
<p>So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian.</p>
<p>I want to ask under this hypothesis,</p>
<p>what do I expect to see?</p>
<p>So the first thing I would say is I wouldn&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>to see a universe that was that big, okay?</p>
<p>The second thing is I wouldn&rsquo;t expect the resolution</p>
<p>of the universe to be as good as it is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always possible that if our superhuman simulators</p>
<p>only have finite resources,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t render the entire universe, right?</p>
<p>That the part that is out there,</p>
<p>the two trillion galaxies,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t actually being simulated fully, okay?</p>
<p>But then the obvious extrapolation of that</p>
<p>is that only I am being simulated fully.</p>
<p>Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only thing that is real.</p>
<p>The rest of you are just chat bots.</p>
<p>Beyond this wall, I see the wall,</p>
<p>but there is literally nothing</p>
<p>on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>That is sort of the Bayesian prediction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it would be like</p>
<p>to do an efficient simulation of me.</p>
<p>So like none of that seems quite realistic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see, I hear the argument that it&rsquo;s just possible</p>
<p>and easy to simulate lots of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any evidence from what we know</p>
<p>about our universe that we look like a simulated universe.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you can say,</p>
<p>well, we don&rsquo;t know what it would look like,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities.</p>
<p>Like your job is to say under this theory,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you would expect to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation</p>
<p>as a thing that&rsquo;s like a video game</p>
<p>where only a small subset is being rendered.</p>
<p>But say the entire, all the laws of physics,</p>
<p>the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe,</p>
<p>it had a creator.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s always possible.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s not useful to think about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about physics.</p>
<p>The way Nick Bostrom phrases it,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s possible to simulate a universe,</p>
<p>eventually we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You can use that by the way for a lot of things.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>But I guess the question is,</p>
<p>how hard is it to create a universe?</p>
<p>I wrote a little blog post about this</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;m missing something,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an argument that says not only</p>
<p>that it might be possible to simulate a universe,</p>
<p>but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute</p>
<p>consciousness and agency to the little things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re simulating, to our little artificial beings,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a lot more of them</p>
<p>than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe</p>
<p>or there will be in the future, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an argument that not only</p>
<p>is being a simulation possible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probable because in the space</p>
<p>of all living consciousnesses,</p>
<p>most of them are being simulated, right?</p>
<p>Most of them are not at the top level.</p>
<p>I think that argument must be wrong</p>
<p>because it follows from that argument that,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re simulated, but we can also simulate other things,</p>
<p>well, but if we can simulate other things,</p>
<p>they can simulate other things, right?</p>
<p>If we give them enough power and resolution</p>
<p>and ultimately we&rsquo;ll reach a bottom</p>
<p>because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re made of atoms and so forth,</p>
<p>so there will be the cheapest possible simulations.</p>
<p>And if you believe the original argument,</p>
<p>you should conclude that we should be</p>
<p>in the cheapest possible simulation</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where most people are.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t look like that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look at all like we&rsquo;re at the edge of resolution,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re 16 bit things.</p>
<p>It seems much easier to make much lower level things</p>
<p>than we are.</p>
<p>And also, I questioned the whole approach</p>
<p>to the anthropic principle</p>
<p>that says we are typical observers in the universe.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s not actually,</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of selection that we can do</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re typical within things we already know,</p>
<p>but not typical within all of the universe.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life,</p>
<p>however you would like to define intelligent life,</p>
<p>out there in the universe?</p>
<p>My guess is that there is not intelligent life</p>
<p>in the observable universe other than us, simply</p>
<p>on the basis of the fact that the likely number</p>
<p>of other intelligent species in the observable universe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two likely numbers, zero or billions.</p>
<p>And if there had been billions,</p>
<p>you would have noticed already.</p>
<p>For there to be literally like a small number,</p>
<p>like, you know, Star Trek,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy,</p>
<p>but not a billion, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of bizarre to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for me to imagine that there are zero others</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just a big bottleneck</p>
<p>to making multicellular life</p>
<p>or technological life or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for me to imagine</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a whole bunch out there</p>
<p>that have somehow remained hidden from us.</p>
<p>The question I&rsquo;d like to ask</p>
<p>is what would intelligent life look like?</p>
<p>What I mean by that question and where it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways</p>
<p>different than the one that has on Earth?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s all kinds of intelligent life</p>
<p>that operates at different scales</p>
<p>of both size and temporal.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s a great possibility</p>
<p>because I think we should be humble</p>
<p>about what intelligence is, what life is.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even agree on what life is,</p>
<p>much less what intelligent life is, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an argument for humility,</p>
<p>saying there could be intelligent life</p>
<p>of a very different character, right?</p>
<p>Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent</p>
<p>but never invent space travel</p>
<p>because they live in the ocean</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have thumbs, right?</p>
<p>So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting.</p>
<p>Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species</p>
<p>that just don&rsquo;t make technology, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s compatible with the data, I think.</p>
<p>And I think maybe what you&rsquo;re pointing at</p>
<p>is even more out there versions of intelligence,</p>
<p>intelligence in intermolecular clouds</p>
<p>or on the surface of a neutron star</p>
<p>or in between the galaxies in giant things</p>
<p>where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years.</p>
<p>On the one hand, yes,</p>
<p>we should be very open minded about those things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics.</p>
<p>There might be something about the laws of physics,</p>
<p>even though we don&rsquo;t currently know</p>
<p>exactly what that thing would be,</p>
<p>that makes meters and years</p>
<p>the right length and timescales for intelligent life.</p>
<p>Maybe not, but we&rsquo;re made of atoms,</p>
<p>atoms have a certain size,</p>
<p>we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not impossible to me that there&rsquo;s a sweet spot</p>
<p>for intelligent life that we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m open minded either way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open minded either being humble</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all sorts of different kinds of life</p>
<p>or no, there&rsquo;s a reason we just don&rsquo;t know it yet</p>
<p>why life like ours is the kind of life that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m of two minds too,</p>
<p>but I often wonder if our brains is just designed</p>
<p>to quite obviously to operate and see the world</p>
<p>in these timescales and we&rsquo;re almost blind</p>
<p>and the tools we&rsquo;ve created for detecting things are blind</p>
<p>to the kind of observation needed</p>
<p>to see intelligent life at other scales.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m totally open to that,</p>
<p>but so here&rsquo;s another argument I would make,</p>
<p>we have looked for intelligent life,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve looked at for it in the dumbest way we can,</p>
<p>by turning radio telescopes to the sky.</p>
<p>And why in the world would a super advanced civilization</p>
<p>randomly beam out radio signals wastefully</p>
<p>in all directions into the universe?</p>
<p>That just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,</p>
<p>especially because in order to think</p>
<p>that you would actually contact another civilization,</p>
<p>you would have to do it forever,</p>
<p>you have to keep doing it for millions of years,</p>
<p>that sounds like a waste of resources.</p>
<p>If you thought that there were other solar systems</p>
<p>with planets around them,</p>
<p>where maybe intelligent life didn&rsquo;t yet exist,</p>
<p>but might someday,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t try to talk to it with radio waves,</p>
<p>you would send a spacecraft out there</p>
<p>and you would park it around there</p>
<p>and it would be like, from our point of view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be like 2001, where there was a monolith.</p>
<p>Monolith.</p>
<p>There could be an artifact,</p>
<p>in fact, the other way works also, right?</p>
<p>There could be artifacts in our solar system</p>
<p>that have been put there</p>
<p>by other technologically advanced civilizations</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we will eventually contact them.</p>
<p>We just haven&rsquo;t explored the solar system well enough yet</p>
<p>to find them.</p>
<p>The reason why we don&rsquo;t think about that</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;re young and impatient, right?</p>
<p>Like, it would take more than my lifetime</p>
<p>to actually send something to another star system</p>
<p>and wait for it and then come back.</p>
<p>So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of years or million year time scales,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clearly the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Are you excited by the thing</p>
<p>that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general?</p>
<p>Space, but the idea of space exploration,</p>
<p>even though your, or your species is young and impatient?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I do think that space travel is crucially important,</p>
<p>long term.</p>
<p>Even to other star systems.</p>
<p>And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty</p>
<p>because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light</p>
<p>to another star system,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be dead before we get there, right?</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s much easier.</p>
<p>And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories,</p>
<p>they imagine we&rsquo;d go faster than the speed of light</p>
<p>because otherwise they&rsquo;re too impatient, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna go faster than the speed of light,</p>
<p>but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan</p>
<p>gets extended to thousands of years.</p>
<p>And once you do that,</p>
<p>then the stars are much closer effectively, right?</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s a hundred year trip, right?</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s gonna be the future,</p>
<p>the far future, not my lifetime once again,</p>
<p>but baby steps.</p>
<p>Unless your lifetime gets extended.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s in a race against time, right?</p>
<p>A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things</p>
<p>said, you know, you and I are gonna die,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know about our grandchildren.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, predicting the future is hard,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s at least a plausible scenario.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier,</p>
<p>there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right?</p>
<p>Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere</p>
<p>is a really important longterm goal.</p>
<p>What kind of questions can science not currently answer,</p>
<p>but might soon?</p>
<p>When you think about the problems and the mysteries</p>
<p>before us that may be within reach of science.</p>
<p>I think an obvious one is the origin of life.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how that happened.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically</p>
<p>actually, you know, literally on earth,</p>
<p>but starting life from non life is something</p>
<p>I kind of think we&rsquo;re close to, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really.</p>
<p>You really think so?</p>
<p>Like how difficult is it to start life?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve talked to people,</p>
<p>including on the podcast about this.</p>
<p>You know, life requires three things.</p>
<p>Life as we know it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a difference with life,</p>
<p>which who knows what it is,</p>
<p>and life as we know it,</p>
<p>which we can talk about with some intelligence.</p>
<p>So life as we know it requires compartmentalization.</p>
<p>You need like a little membrane around your cell.</p>
<p>Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it</p>
<p>and let that make you do things.</p>
<p>And then replication, okay?</p>
<p>So you need to have some information about who you are</p>
<p>that you pass down to future generations.</p>
<p>In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy.</p>
<p>Not hard to make lipid bilayers</p>
<p>that come into little cellular walls pretty easily.</p>
<p>Metabolism and replication are hard,</p>
<p>but replication we&rsquo;re close to.</p>
<p>People have made RNA like molecules in the lab</p>
<p>that I think the state of the art is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not able to make one molecule</p>
<p>that reproduces itself,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re able to make two molecules</p>
<p>that reproduce each other.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty close.</p>
<p>Metabolism is harder, believe it or not,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s sort of the most obvious thing,</p>
<p>but you want some sort of controlled metabolism</p>
<p>and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies</p>
<p>is quite complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to see it just popping into existence</p>
<p>all by itself.</p>
<p>It probably took a while,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>And in fact, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>nearly enough money on it.</p>
<p>If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money</p>
<p>because it would change our view of the world</p>
<p>if we could actually make life in the lab</p>
<p>and understand how it was made originally here on earth.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;d have some ripple effects</p>
<p>that help cure disease and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, just that understanding.</p>
<p>So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re making cells.</p>
<p>Right now, the best way to do that</p>
<p>is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right?</p>
<p>Well, Craig Venter several years ago</p>
<p>created an artificial cell, but all he did was,</p>
<p>not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment,</p>
<p>but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell</p>
<p>and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go.</p>
<p>What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, we define intelligence, of course,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just even say Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>the modern intelligence in our human brain.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of what&rsquo;s involved in that leap</p>
<p>and how big of a leap that is?</p>
<p>So AI would count in this, or do you really want life?</p>
<p>Do you want really an organism in some sense?</p>
<p>AI would count, I think.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, of course AI would count.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say artificial consciousness, right?</p>
<p>So I do not think we are on the threshold</p>
<p>of creating artificial consciousness.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, again, very educated about how close we are,</p>
<p>but my impression is not that we&rsquo;re really close</p>
<p>because we understand how little we understand</p>
<p>of consciousness and what it is.</p>
<p>So if we don&rsquo;t have any idea what it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to imagine we&rsquo;re on the threshold</p>
<p>of making it ourselves.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s doable, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any obstacles in principle.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would hold out some interest</p>
<p>in that happening eventually.</p>
<p>I think in general, consciousness,</p>
<p>I think we would be just surprised</p>
<p>how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence.</p>
<p>I think consciousness is a thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just something we all fake.</p>
<p>Well, good.</p>
<p>No, actually, I like this idea that in fact,</p>
<p>consciousness is way less mysterious than we think</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all at every time, at every moment,</p>
<p>less conscious than we think we are, right?</p>
<p>We can fool things.</p>
<p>And I think that plus the idea</p>
<p>that you not only have artificial intelligent systems,</p>
<p>but you put them in a body, right,</p>
<p>give them a robot body,</p>
<p>that will help the faking a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think creating consciousness</p>
<p>in artificial consciousness is as simple</p>
<p>as asking a Roomba to say, I&rsquo;m conscious,</p>
<p>and refusing to be talked out of it.</p>
<p>Could be, it could be.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;m almost being silly,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do with each other.</p>
<p>This is the kind of,</p>
<p>that consciousness is also a social construct.</p>
<p>And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct.</p>
<p>And so reaching that bar involves something that&rsquo;s beyond,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily involve</p>
<p>the fundamental understanding of how you go</p>
<p>from electrons to neurons to cognition.</p>
<p>No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point.</p>
<p>And in fact, what it suggests is,</p>
<p>so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling,</p>
<p>who I had on the podcast,</p>
<p>and who does these experiments with very simple robots,</p>
<p>but they look like animals,</p>
<p>and they can look like they&rsquo;re experiencing pain,</p>
<p>and we human beings react very negatively</p>
<p>to these little robots</p>
<p>looking like they&rsquo;re experiencing pain.</p>
<p>And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they&rsquo;re just robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really pain, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just some electrons going around.</p>
<p>But then you realize, you and I are just electrons</p>
<p>going around, and that&rsquo;s what pain is also.</p>
<p>And so what I would have an easy time imagining</p>
<p>is that there is a spectrum</p>
<p>between these simple little robots that Kate works with</p>
<p>and a human being,</p>
<p>where there are things that sort of</p>
<p>by some strict definition,</p>
<p>Turing test level thing are not conscious,</p>
<p>but nevertheless walk and talk like they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>And it could be that the future is,</p>
<p>I mean, Siri is close, right?</p>
<p>And so it might be the future</p>
<p>has a lot more agents like that.</p>
<p>And in fact, rather than someday going,</p>
<p>aha, we have consciousness,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just creep up on it with more and more</p>
<p>accurate reflections of what we expect.</p>
<p>And in the future, maybe the present,</p>
<p>for example, we haven&rsquo;t met before,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re basically assuming that I&rsquo;m human as it&rsquo;s a high</p>
<p>probability at this time because the yeah,</p>
<p>but in the future,</p>
<p>there might be question marks around that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, absolutely.</p>
<p>Certainly videos are almost to the point</p>
<p>where you shouldn&rsquo;t trust them already.</p>
<p>Photos you can&rsquo;t trust, right?</p>
<p>Videos is easier to trust,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re getting worse that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting better at faking them, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so physical embodied people,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s so hard about faking that?</p>
<p>So this is very depressing,</p>
<p>this conversation we&rsquo;re having right now.</p>
<p>So I mean,</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>To me, you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exciting to you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a sobering thought.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very bad, right?</p>
<p>At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in the middle of a phase transition</p>
<p>as we are right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I, in general,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not blind to all the threats.</p>
<p>I am excited by the power of technology to solve,</p>
<p>to protect us against the threats as they evolve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world,</p>
<p>but in everything I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>all of the brilliant people in the world that I&rsquo;ve met</p>
<p>are good people.</p>
<p>So the army of the good</p>
<p>in terms of the development of technology is large.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re way more optimistic than I am.</p>
<p>I think that goodness and badness</p>
<p>are equally distributed among intelligent</p>
<p>and unintelligent people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much of a correlation there.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Neither of us have proof.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Again, opinions are free, right?</p>
<p>Nor definitions of good and evil.</p>
<p>We come without definitions or without data opinions.</p>
<p>So what kind of questions can science not currently answer</p>
<p>and may never be able to answer in your view?</p>
<p>Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad?</p>
<p>What is right and wrong?</p>
<p>I think that there are questions that,</p>
<p>science tells us what happens,</p>
<p>what the world is and what it does.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say what the world should do</p>
<p>or what we should do,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re part of the world.</p>
<p>But we are part of the world</p>
<p>and we have the ability to feel like something&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And to make a very long story very short,</p>
<p>I think that the idea of moral philosophy</p>
<p>is systematizing our intuitions</p>
<p>of what is right and what is wrong.</p>
<p>And science might be able to predict ahead of time</p>
<p>what we will do,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t ever be able to judge</p>
<p>whether we should have done it or not.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re kind of unique in terms of scientists.</p>
<p>Listen, it doesn&rsquo;t have to do with podcasts,</p>
<p>but even just reaching out,</p>
<p>I think you referred to as sort of</p>
<p>doing interdisciplinary science.</p>
<p>So you reach out and talk to people</p>
<p>that are outside of your discipline,</p>
<p>which I always hope that&rsquo;s what science was for.</p>
<p>In fact, I was a little disillusioned</p>
<p>when I realized that academia is very siloed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>how, at your own level,</p>
<p>how do you prepare for these conversations?</p>
<p>How do you think about these conversations?</p>
<p>How do you open your mind enough</p>
<p>to have these conversations?</p>
<p>And it may be a little bit broader,</p>
<p>how can you advise other scientists</p>
<p>to have these kinds of conversations?</p>
<p>Not at the podcast,</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re doing a podcast is awesome,</p>
<p>other people get to hear them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also good to have it without mics in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question, but a tough one to answer.</p>
<p>I think about a guy I know who&rsquo;s a personal trainer,</p>
<p>and he was asked on a podcast,</p>
<p>how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout?</p>
<p>How do we make that discipline to go and work out?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, why are you asking me?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop working out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to psych myself up.</p>
<p>So, and likewise, he asked me,</p>
<p>how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations</p>
<p>on all sorts of different things,</p>
<p>all sorts of different people?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s what makes me go, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, I couldn&rsquo;t stop doing that.</p>
<p>I did that long before any of them were recorded.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it</p>
<p>was making sure I would read all these books</p>
<p>that I had purchased, right?</p>
<p>Like all these books I wanted to read,</p>
<p>not enough time to read them.</p>
<p>And now if I have the motivation,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m gonna interview Pat Churchland,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna finally read her book.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s absolutely true</p>
<p>that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk to people.</p>
<p>We rarely do.</p>
<p>And in fact, when we do, it&rsquo;s punished.</p>
<p>You know, like the people who do it successfully</p>
<p>generally first became very successful</p>
<p>within their little siloed discipline.</p>
<p>And only then did they start expanding out.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a young person, you know,</p>
<p>I have graduate students.</p>
<p>I try to be very, very candid with them about this,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s, you know, most graduate students</p>
<p>are to not become faculty members, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough road.</p>
<p>And so live the life you wanna live,</p>
<p>but do it with your eyes open</p>
<p>about what it does to your job chances.</p>
<p>And the more broad you are</p>
<p>and the less time you spend hyper specializing</p>
<p>in your field, the lower your job chances are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just an academic reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible, I don&rsquo;t like it, but it&rsquo;s a reality.</p>
<p>And for some people, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s plenty of people who are wonderful scientists</p>
<p>who have zero interest in branching out</p>
<p>and talking to things, to anyone outside their field.</p>
<p>But it is disillusioning to me.</p>
<p>Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had</p>
<p>of the intellectual academic life</p>
<p>is belied by the reality of it.</p>
<p>The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline</p>
<p>and that is a positive good is just so rare</p>
<p>in universities that it may as well not exist at all.</p>
<p>But that said, even though you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>like the personal trainer, because you just can&rsquo;t help it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also an inspiration to others.</p>
<p>Like I could speak for myself.</p>
<p>You know, I also have a career I&rsquo;m thinking about, right?</p>
<p>And without your podcast,</p>
<p>I may have not have been doing this at all, right?</p>
<p>So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations</p>
<p>is kind of what science is about in many ways.</p>
<p>The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s much harder to do interdisciplinary papers,</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>And conversations are easier.</p>
<p>So conversations is the beginning.</p>
<p>And in the field of AI, it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>that we should think outside of pure computer vision</p>
<p>competitions on a particular data sets.</p>
<p>We should think about the broader impact</p>
<p>of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics,</p>
<p>to psychology, to neuroscience and having these</p>
<p>conversations so that you&rsquo;re an inspiration.</p>
<p>And so never know how the world changes.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve a huge number of people come up to me,</p>
<p>grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it.</p>
<p>And they will probably have that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be ripple effects when they become faculty</p>
<p>and so on and so on.</p>
<p>We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism.</p>
<p>And Sean, thank you so much for talking to me, it was awesome.</p>
<p>No, Lex, thank you very much for this conversation.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
