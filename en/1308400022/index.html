    <p>Hi friends! Today we&rsquo;re going to talk about being insecure, alright? I&rsquo;m going to give</p>
<p>you my kind of definition of it, and you know it&rsquo;s like that feeling, like I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>just go ahead and start this episode off the bat, bitch, we ain&rsquo;t got no time to waste,</p>
<p>what if we die, you know? Let&rsquo;s just get into it. So like, there&rsquo;s a couple different versions</p>
<p>of being insecure, and everyone&rsquo;s kind of got their own, but like I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>the insecure feeling of like, you just have something wrong with you, that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what it is, where that comes from, and then also feeling insecure with like, all kind</p>
<p>of shit, and what leads to that feeling. I&rsquo;m not going to give too many tips about confidence</p>
<p>and like how to be more confident, that can be its own episode in itself, but for this</p>
<p>one I want to dig into like the whole topic of being insecure and feeling like you have</p>
<p>something wrong with you, and then how to combat that, and like how to stop doing that.</p>
<p>So in truly old-fashioned, we&rsquo;re just going to go into how you got fucked up as a kid,</p>
<p>basically. So my whole thing that I&rsquo;ve learned about feeling insecure was that anytime something</p>
<p>bad would happen to me, I would make it mean that something was wrong or bad about me.</p>
<p>And a lot of times there&rsquo;s situations where you can&rsquo;t control what&rsquo;s going on or you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have an explanation. And when I was younger, I just adopted that. So every time something</p>
<p>would happen, it was just like, oh, it&rsquo;s my fault. Like, taking accountability, taking</p>
<p>blame for it, shit like that. But also, it was like, oh, it&rsquo;s because something&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with me. Like when someone didn&rsquo;t pick me, or I felt like my parents liked someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kids more than me, like I would just be like, oh, like there&rsquo;s just something wrong with</p>
<p>me then, or whatever. But that led into a lot of bad shit. But telling myself it was</p>
<p>about me just became my go-to thought process. Like anytime something bad happened, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, oh, it&rsquo;s because of me. Oh, it&rsquo;s this. Oh, it&rsquo;s that. There&rsquo;s just something wrong</p>
<p>with me whenever there wasn&rsquo;t an explanation. But a lot of the times when I was younger,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ask for an explanation. I didn&rsquo;t know that, like, there was any other explanation</p>
<p>other than there was something wrong with me and that it was my fault. And I know a</p>
<p>lot of people struggle with that. So that&rsquo;s why I want to open up and dive into this whole</p>
<p>topic with the whole insecurity thing. And I plan to come on here and tell you guys my</p>
<p>theory and what I learned from myself. But I took it a step further, and I googled it,</p>
<p>and I started like researching it and talking to some people. And I realized, this is actually</p>
<p>like a common thing and like a common phenomenon for a lot of people. So when I was younger,</p>
<p>telling myself, oh, there&rsquo;s just something wrong with me, put the blame on to me. So</p>
<p>like when I didn&rsquo;t understand why a situation was going on, or something hurt me, or someone</p>
<p>like treated me bad, I didn&rsquo;t know why they did it. But telling myself, oh, it&rsquo;s because of</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s wrong with me or something, I did something wrong, or it&rsquo;s just me telling myself</p>
<p>that put the responsibility on me. And what that does is gives me a sense of control over the</p>
<p>situation. Because if I&rsquo;m the issue, I can change, I can figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with me. And I can</p>
<p>fix it. And then this won&rsquo;t happen anymore. These bad things won&rsquo;t happen anymore. People won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>treat me bad anymore. Because like I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, like I had a tough childhood with bullying,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t understand why people bullied me and just fucking hated me and wanted to make fun</p>
<p>of me so bad and wanted to like hurt me. So that was a thought process I kind of went for. And</p>
<p>then I turned the blade at myself. And I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna figure out what the fuck is wrong with</p>
<p>you kid. I was like, we&rsquo;re gonna figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with us so that people stop hurting us. And</p>
<p>that right there will make you feel more empowered than facing the reality of people just are</p>
<p>treating me bad, or I don&rsquo;t have any control over the situation. Like you&rsquo;re facing powerlessness</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on or someone hurts you or someone does something when you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why. And you don&rsquo;t know anything you can do to stop it. That was my only way of claiming a</p>
<p>sense of power and feeling empowered about the situation I was in and the way I was being treated.</p>
<p>And when I said I looked into this, this is a common phenomenon in people that are raped,</p>
<p>and people that are attacked and abused and like beaten. Some rape victims will say, Oh,</p>
<p>it was my fault. I wore a slutty dress. Oh, it was my fault. I shouldn&rsquo;t have like been nice to</p>
<p>this guy. Oh, it was my fault. I got kidnapped in a parking lot. I should have been more aware of my</p>
<p>surroundings. People that do this are doing the same thing that I was doing. Because it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>to look at the situation like it was my fault, then for someone that&rsquo;s been raped to look at</p>
<p>the situation and say, Yeah, I was powerless. And someone raped me. That&rsquo;s a lot harder to face and</p>
<p>accept and deal with. And that will make you like deconstruct your entire sense of safety and</p>
<p>well being in the world and your hope in humanity. Like looking at a situation like you were just</p>
<p>abused, just fucking because like that will fuck with you to try to face that. So a lot of people</p>
<p>do this whole, Oh, it&rsquo;s something about me, there&rsquo;s something wrong with me. That&rsquo;s a common</p>
<p>like, coping mechanism, I guess we could say. But my situation was a little bit different, because</p>
<p>there was no explanation for what was going on with not being chosen, not being treated good,</p>
<p>not being wanted. I just kept saying, Oh, it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s something wrong with me. There</p>
<p>must just be something wrong with me. I don&rsquo;t know. And I didn&rsquo;t have anything to base that off</p>
<p>of. I had no idea what was wrong with me. But I just told myself, Oh, there must be something</p>
<p>because of the way people are treating me. And then that led me to believe that something was</p>
<p>just innately and internally wrong with me. And I&rsquo;m doomed until I figured it out. And that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>led me to fucking myself up and completely losing myself and who I am in any sense of self that I</p>
<p>had from a very young age. So I tried to become everything that everybody else wanted, especially</p>
<p>my parents, you guys see so much range and my personality and range and everything about me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve done so much shit, trying to gain approval. And I&rsquo;ve changed myself in so many</p>
<p>ways. And I&rsquo;ve become so many different versions of myself. And I&rsquo;ve just tried so hard to gain</p>
<p>the approval from others, since I can remember that I lost myself. And it got to the point where</p>
<p>I kept telling myself, like when I would become a new version of myself, because I thought that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what my parents would want, I would still feel the same, like not prioritized, not really wanted.</p>
<p>And then I would just tell myself the same thing. Oh, it&rsquo;s just because there&rsquo;s something wrong with</p>
<p>me. Let me try something else. Let me try something else. And then I got to a point where I was so</p>
<p>frustrated of like, what the fuck is the something else? Like, I don&rsquo;t know what else to try anymore.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s working. So I had to look at the way I was thinking about shit, and telling myself that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something wrong with me. Because that belief served me for a long time, telling myself</p>
<p>that served me for a long time and made me feel better and more empowered about a situation I</p>
<p>could not change. Now I&rsquo;m able to change it. And then when I moved into this mindset of like,</p>
<p>I do have control, and I can change things. That&rsquo;s when my belief that used to make me feel</p>
<p>empowered made me feel disempowered. Because now, when something would go wrong, I&rsquo;m saying now,</p>
<p>but like in the recent past, when something would go wrong, I would just say, Oh, it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s wrong with me. And it would make me feel powerless, because I&rsquo;m like, fuck, like I did</p>
<p>everything right. And there&rsquo;s just something wrong with me. That&rsquo;s just holding me back and preventing</p>
<p>me. So I had to reevaluate. And that&rsquo;s really what it was. I just got up against so much frustration.</p>
<p>And I was trying and it&rsquo;s like, I had to start looking for other solutions to my problem. I had</p>
<p>to start looking at other shit. And what I mean by other shit is the meanings I was assigning to</p>
<p>situations. So there were some times in my childhood where I keep saying my parents just</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to just spit that out. But really anybody in my childhood, my aunt, my uncle,</p>
<p>I was very close with my aunt, like she put herself in my life, and tried to shove herself</p>
<p>in the mom role. And like manipulated me into certain things. Like when you&rsquo;re a kid, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>easily manipulated. And I was very, very attached to my aunt. And then one day I woke up and she had</p>
<p>abandoned me and moved to Pennsylvania. So I&rsquo;ve had this fucking issue with everyone, even with</p>
<p>friends. Like I&rsquo;ve said before, in the podcast, I&rsquo;ve never felt someone&rsquo;s favorite. I never dated</p>
<p>really, like in school growing up, I never fucking dated until I&rsquo;m 21. And that relationship was a</p>
<p>goddamn motherfucking shit show, which we will not talk about. But I did have to own up to the way</p>
<p>that I was perceiving situations in the past of like, oh, I&rsquo;m not good enough. That was also being</p>
<p>clouded by my judgment, because there were situations that were not as personal as I thought.</p>
<p>And I had to own up to that, which sucks. And it&rsquo;s not easy to do. And it&rsquo;s kind of painful. But you</p>
<p>have to do it if you want to actually fucking grow and get through shit. But the main thing I want to</p>
<p>say first is the only way out of this and if you have this belief, or if you have a sense of</p>
<p>insecurity, or if you just feel like everything going wrong is has something to do with you,</p>
<p>and it means something is bad or wrong about you, what you need to do is start seeing and looking</p>
<p>for the other possibilities that don&rsquo;t have anything to do with something being wrong with</p>
<p>you. But I&rsquo;m going to give you a couple examples of like, straight up real life things that have</p>
<p>happened to me. And then the one breaking point I had where my whole mindset flipped about being</p>
<p>insecure, and feeling like I had something wrong with me, like I had to come face to face with it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to tell you a situation that rocked the shit out of me to make me do that. Okay, so</p>
<p>one of my first small examples, an insecure person, be making every goddamn thing means something bad</p>
<p>about them or just something bad in general, because how I used to be, when like, say I was</p>
<p>texting someone, like I had met someone, and I was texting them, and I was excited to talk to them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, if they were taking a little bit too long to respond, I would start thinking,</p>
<p>Oh my god, they don&rsquo;t like me anymore. Oh my god, they don&rsquo;t like me. Oh my god, I&rsquo;m annoying them.</p>
<p>Oh, fuck, like, I would just start getting really insecure about them even liking me. And I would</p>
<p>start tripping the fuck out just because they wouldn&rsquo;t text me back. I&rsquo;d be like, Oh my god,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like me anymore. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re ignoring me. Like I would get like that. But then</p>
<p>me now like after growing up and like growing out of that mindset, I&rsquo;ll throw other possibilities</p>
<p>out to myself like, Oh, maybe they&rsquo;re busy. Maybe they&rsquo;re doing something. Maybe they&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>shower. Maybe they&rsquo;re wiping their fucking ass, you know, like you never know what someone&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>So if someone&rsquo;s not texting you back, don&rsquo;t automatically catastrophize and be like, Oh my</p>
<p>god, it&rsquo;s something about me. They don&rsquo;t like me. Take the me out of it. Start looking for other</p>
<p>explanations that have nothing to do with you. Just stop immediately attacking yourself when</p>
<p>something doesn&rsquo;t go the way you want. So my next example that&rsquo;s kind of small is like if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving down the road, and a car cuts you off. Someone that&rsquo;s insecure is going to make that</p>
<p>mean something about them like, ah, like they&rsquo;re gonna take it personal. It&rsquo;s possible that that</p>
<p>car just spotted you and was like, fuck them. I don&rsquo;t like them and cut you off. But you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if that&rsquo;s the truth. But an insecure person is automatically going to assume that. So what you</p>
<p>need to start doing is looking for Okay, is that the truth? Or could a possibility be that this</p>
<p>person is just in a rush and they&rsquo;re not looking around. They&rsquo;re not seeing who&rsquo;s in their way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in a rush to get somewhere and they&rsquo;re just trying to get there. And they&rsquo;re not worrying</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s in their way. And any other car that was in my spot, they would have got cut off to</p>
<p>look for other ways to see situations as not as personal, and as not as like of an attack on you.</p>
<p>Oh, one more little example that happened yesterday. And I&rsquo;m very conscious of this at the</p>
<p>gym. I read something funny on my phone. And I laughed, like out loud, like I literally laughed</p>
<p>like I was laughing. And this person walking by me, like, look down and got like really insecure.</p>
<p>Because I assume that they thought I was laughing at them. So I pulled my phone up and made sure</p>
<p>they knew I was looking at something on my phone. So from their perspective, if they&rsquo;re an insecure</p>
<p>person, they&rsquo;re gonna assume that I&rsquo;m laughing at them. Because I&rsquo;m just laughing and insecure</p>
<p>person is going to tell theirself that they&rsquo;re going to be worried that you&rsquo;re laughing at them</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually not. You know what I mean? Like I used to be that motherfucker. Like anytime</p>
<p>someone would look at me funny. I&rsquo;m like, What the fuck are you looking at, bitch? Like, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would think in my head. Or if I was on an insecure day where I was like, sad, I&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>Oh, fuck, what are they looking at me for? Do I look ugly? Do I look bad? yada yada. Like,</p>
<p>it just depended like the mood I was in of how, which way I was going to take it was I going to</p>
<p>get aggressive and secure? Or was I going to get sad and secure and start like nitpicking myself</p>
<p>and being like, Oh my god, do I look okay? Do I look like shit? Is something wrong? But start</p>
<p>looking for things in your environment. Like that guy that thought I was laughing at him yesterday.</p>
<p>Like, if you could have seen my phone in my hand, you could have thrown yourself the possibility.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe he&rsquo;s laughing at me. Or maybe he&rsquo;s laughing at something on his phone. He has his</p>
<p>fucking AirPods in. Maybe he&rsquo;s listening to a funny podcast. Maybe he&rsquo;s listening to a weird</p>
<p>activity. You get my point. Okay, now I want to move into the fucking riveting realization that I</p>
<p>have the shit that rocked me and like knocked me on my ass. And I literally got this mindset</p>
<p>beat out of me. What happened was with my app. So when I started my app, I was like, okay,</p>
<p>I see what&rsquo;s on the market. I see the other apps that are like my app that are notification based</p>
<p>and send like positive things. I have the app positive focus. So if you want to download it,</p>
<p>you can I&rsquo;ll put the link in the description of this. But it&rsquo;s basically an app for notifications</p>
<p>of like just new perspectives and positive messages to come to your phone every day.</p>
<p>So I wanted to start an app like that. I saw it was on the market. And I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna top</p>
<p>this easily. Like what I&rsquo;m about to make and the shit that I could make. And the quotes that I</p>
<p>could share would be so much fucking better. Like this is what I like I could make something that</p>
<p>people actually would feel better with because the notifications I was getting from the other</p>
<p>apps were like weak sauce. They like sucked. And they didn&rsquo;t really do shit. So I wanted things</p>
<p>that would actually make people think and would actually like help their life. So I was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make it so I made the app. And I was trying to get it like out there. I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>obviously, I can see that my app is 10 times better quality of what it&rsquo;s sharing than these</p>
<p>other apps. And these other apps have like millions of fucking downloads and millions of</p>
<p>users like it was insane. And I was struggling to even get like 100 downloads on my app. So I was</p>
<p>trying all these different avenues of like ways that I could figure out how to gain like awareness</p>
<p>of my app and like get it out there to people. So I was posting about it on my social media,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have near the following that I have now like it was a very small following.</p>
<p>So one thing I was doing was every single day, I was going on to the email lists of different</p>
<p>counselors and psychologists and therapists, and all different cities all over the United States.</p>
<p>And I was sending around two to 300 emails every day to different therapists for two months</p>
<p>straight. And I was sending them an email basically saying like, Hi, just letting you know</p>
<p>that like, I&rsquo;m the creator of this app. And I&rsquo;m informing you about it so that you can share it</p>
<p>with clients as a free resource if you want to, like just letting you know this app is available.</p>
<p>Check it out. If you get a chance, let me know your thoughts, yada, yada, like I just offered it</p>
<p>and like made a lot of people aware of it that are in the mental health space so that they could</p>
<p>recommend it to clients and I can help myself grow, you know, like I was trying to be very</p>
<p>smart with the way that I was doing this. And I was just being very genuine. So I was doing that</p>
<p>for two months, I was sending two to 300 emails a day. And my app was not growing. And I was trying</p>
<p>to post about it. I was trying to advertise in other ways. I made a Facebook page, I was paying</p>
<p>for Facebook ads, I was doing everything I was supposed to do, according to the YouTube videos</p>
<p>that I was watching for Facebook ads, but I was not getting shit for fucking like, return on the</p>
<p>ads. So I was getting very, like, hopeless. And I&rsquo;m just like, God fucking damn, bro. Like,</p>
<p>everything that seems to work for everybody else. I&rsquo;m doing it times 10. And it&rsquo;s not fucking</p>
<p>working. Like, holy shit. Like I was running the fuck out of my Facebook ads. And I was sending</p>
<p>the fuck out of some emails to these goddamn therapists and counselors. And my app was just</p>
<p>not growing. Like it just wasn&rsquo;t cracking any downloads, I was getting so hopeless. And my app</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have anyone upgrade on it for six months. That wasn&rsquo;t my like, friends or family. So like</p>
<p>they all supported me, but I got no actual like, new upgrades or downloads on my app.</p>
<p>And mind you, I didn&rsquo;t have excess money to be throwing at this shit. Like I completely</p>
<p>stopped going out and hanging out with friends. I fucking was like a hermit for like, four months.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t go out to eat. I didn&rsquo;t go out to see anybody. And that&rsquo;s when I like crack down</p>
<p>and lost a bunch of weight is because I had no fucking reason to go out and do shit like I was</p>
<p>okay, if I&rsquo;m going to eat at home, I&rsquo;m at least gonna meal prep and eat healthy. So I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking hang out with anybody. I didn&rsquo;t see anyone. I didn&rsquo;t fucking do shit. I didn&rsquo;t spend</p>
<p>money on shit. I didn&rsquo;t shop. I didn&rsquo;t eat out. I didn&rsquo;t buy anything. I wasn&rsquo;t going out. I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>buying drinks. I literally was saving as much money as I could. So I could put it into this</p>
<p>fucking app and the Facebook ads. But my whole point with like sending all the emails is like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that I could do for free. Like I was trying to exhaust everything I could do</p>
<p>for free. Because I didn&rsquo;t have the fucking money to be throwing at this.</p>
<p>But it seemed like the emails weren&rsquo;t working. I eventually stopped emailing the counselors every</p>
<p>day because I&rsquo;m like, this is taking up too much of my fucking time. So I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna start</p>
<p>getting into Facebook ads and finding ways to really figure out how to do this shit because</p>
<p>clearly learning from these fucking YouTube faggots ain&rsquo;t working. So I was like, let me</p>
<p>read some books. Let me do some like, let me do a course on advertisement and talk to some people</p>
<p>that are in this space and I can actually learn from it. So I spent some time learning marketing</p>
<p>and advertising, learning Facebook ads. And I still was getting no fucking results. And I was</p>
<p>spending hundreds and like getting up into 1000s of dollars on Facebook ads. And I was getting like</p>
<p>no fucking anything for it. So then I was left in the place of like, okay, I&rsquo;m doing everything I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>supposed to fucking do. I&rsquo;m doing the Facebook shit, right? It&rsquo;s just not working. For whatever</p>
<p>reason, it&rsquo;s not fucking working. The therapist thing didn&rsquo;t work. I sent 1000s of emails over</p>
<p>those two months, and barely any of them got back to me. And nobody like downloaded my app and like,</p>
<p>got it. So I was like, what the literal fuck? Like, I can see logically, I&rsquo;m doing everything right.</p>
<p>And then that thought came up. Well, Leo, it just must be because something&rsquo;s fucking wrong with you.</p>
<p>Because I was doing everything that I saw was in my power at the time to achieve the goal that I</p>
<p>wanted. And I was like, well, just for some reason, it ain&rsquo;t fucking working for you. So you just got</p>
<p>something wrong with you. Like, you knew this since you were little. You like, it&rsquo;s just been</p>
<p>a thing. So why did you expect it to be any different? And I went into that. And I was like,</p>
<p>bro, what the fuck? Like, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with me. Like I was at the point</p>
<p>where I was like, no way. I&rsquo;m like, no fucking way. It&rsquo;s me, like repelling myself. I&rsquo;m some</p>
<p>kind of like vibrational repellent from what the fuck I want, like success or whatever. And I was</p>
<p>just like, bro, like I was so frustrated. And it led me to a point of like a fucking meltdown.</p>
<p>And then I started thinking. So I said, okay, the app must not be good enough. So I thought about</p>
<p>adding the journal prompt section to it. And I was like, okay, what are we going to add after that?</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything. Like I made my quotes better. I like added more potent shit.</p>
<p>Like I was trying my best with the damn thing. And then I was okay, I&rsquo;ll add the journal prompt</p>
<p>section. And then what am I going to do after that? I was like, okay, after I add the journal</p>
<p>prompting section, there is no question of the value of my app. So what does that mean? You know,</p>
<p>like I saw the value of my app in that moment. I was like, once I make these changes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer going to be about the problem of the app. Like, it&rsquo;s fucking good. And I can</p>
<p>obviously see it&rsquo;s better than without there. So then I was faced with, okay, if it&rsquo;s not about me,</p>
<p>something being wrong with me, and it&rsquo;s not about the quality of my app, because I can clearly see</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s great. What the fuck is the issue? So I realized I need to try to find people that are</p>
<p>going to value my app. So I was like, okay, Leo, where are the people that are committed to self</p>
<p>awareness and committed to growth? And I realized in that moment, they&rsquo;re not on fucking Facebook,</p>
<p>scrolling Facebook all day, where I&rsquo;m putting my ads. In that moment, I was like, well, damn,</p>
<p>like here I was this whole time, freaking the fuck out. And like, I wanted to just give up,</p>
<p>because I was like, I&rsquo;m doing everything right. And there&rsquo;s just something wrong with me. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not gonna fucking work. Clearly, it&rsquo;s not working. If I entertained that thought,</p>
<p>and I kept believing that I would have quit. But the fact that I questioned it and came to this</p>
<p>new awareness changed everything for me. Because then I geared my attention toward finding the</p>
<p>people that are committed to self growth. I still don&rsquo;t know where the fuck to find them. But I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing better than I was. And I&rsquo;m starting to see a little bit of like a punch up in my app. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, finally, like something&rsquo;s fucking finally working. But it&rsquo;s taken a lot of time. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken like building my Tick Tock audience and making videos and finding the people slowly</p>
<p>that are going to be able to see the value in my app and appreciate it because these losers on</p>
<p>Facebook want the apps that already exist that are just cute little messages that are going to</p>
<p>come to you. They don&rsquo;t want things that are going to make you think people that are distracting</p>
<p>themselves from their life on social media and just scrolling mindlessly are not the ones that</p>
<p>are going to be able to appreciate the life changing shit in my app. Like they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to change their life. They want to cope with their life. That&rsquo;s why they got their phone in front of</p>
<p>their fucking face. And they&rsquo;re scrolling everything, you know. So that whole situation</p>
<p>really had nothing to do with me as a person or anything being wrong with me at the core.</p>
<p>It was about the way I was going about trying to get downloads and people to use my app. Does that</p>
<p>make sense? So you can lie to yourself and blind yourself from like, the true problem going on,</p>
<p>if you want. But the whole insecure thing kind of like cracked for me in this moment.</p>
<p>And I felt so much more in control. I felt ready to fucking go again. I felt like restarted. It</p>
<p>was like a lawnmower died and you just pulled that fucking string and it just restarted. Here</p>
<p>I go. It&rsquo;s like I got that refresh and that reboot of like, okay, like I have a whole new perception.</p>
<p>I have a whole new like outlook on this shit. Now I&rsquo;m ready to go. And it&rsquo;s made it a lot easier</p>
<p>for me to make things and keep going, knowing that it&rsquo;s not an attack on me. Every time something</p>
<p>goes wrong, I look for the other possibilities. But something I find funny about this is in the</p>
<p>past, the belief that something is wrong with me made me feel empowered. But now all that belief</p>
<p>was doing was keeping me blind to what was actually in my power and in my control. You know,</p>
<p>just a little thing I wanted to throw in here. Another thing people struggle with a lot. And a</p>
<p>lot of people asked me about is trying to grow their social media and grow their tick tock.</p>
<p>Girl, I don&rsquo;t know how to work that fucking algorithm. You see me not giving a fuck on</p>
<p>tick tock. I don&rsquo;t know how it works. I genuinely don&rsquo;t get it. Like I don&rsquo;t use sounds. Usually,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use captions. I don&rsquo;t use hashtags. I just make a video and throw it up. And it fucking</p>
<p>does what it&rsquo;s gonna do. I don&rsquo;t know how that works. I&rsquo;ve tried to look into it. And it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make sense to me. Like, I just don&rsquo;t give a shit. I&rsquo;m just like, whatever. And I just go for it.</p>
<p>Because tick tock is very unpredictable. And very like, choosy. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t get it. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. That&rsquo;s another situation where you need to catch yourself. And don&rsquo;t make it mean something</p>
<p>about you. Because you can post a quality ass video, you can post something so funny, or something</p>
<p>so useful and so good. And it just doesn&rsquo;t pick up on the algorithm for whatever reason. It does</p>
<p>not mean that what you made was bad. It does not mean that what you shared was bad. People just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see it. People it just for whatever reason didn&rsquo;t hit the algorithm. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something wrong with you. It does not mean that there&rsquo;s something wrong with the information</p>
<p>you shared or the video you posted. Because I know a lot of people that post really good content,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have a lot of followers. And I&rsquo;m one of them. Because on my life coach tick tock,</p>
<p>I have like 166,000 followers. But the information I share, I honestly think is 10 times better than</p>
<p>most people that are on there. But I know people that share basic ass cookie cutter fucking</p>
<p>information that have a million plus followers. And I&rsquo;m like, I know what I&rsquo;m posting is good.</p>
<p>And for the people that are actually gonna like it, they&rsquo;ll find it, they&rsquo;ll find it eventually,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get to it. And I do what I can, I post every day. But it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s helping the people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s meant to help. And my content is shit that&rsquo;s for people that actually want to see their worth,</p>
<p>see their value and see their control. And that&rsquo;s not always pleasant and nice. The other people</p>
<p>that are really famous are the ones that are like, Oh my god, you should just love yourself.</p>
<p>Oh my god, you&rsquo;re beautiful. You&rsquo;re beautiful just the way you are. You need to self care,</p>
<p>you need to take a break, you need to take it easy on yourself. Like they just say that stupid</p>
<p>fucking shit that makes you feel good. Or like the motivation pages. They just say shit for two</p>
<p>seconds that makes you feel good for a minute. And then it does nothing for you. I say shit that</p>
<p>makes you think I say shit that like will change your whole fucking life if you let it. But I no</p>
<p>longer let that affect what I think of my own quality of what I&rsquo;m posting. Like I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking good. So it&rsquo;s good. If the algorithm doesn&rsquo;t pick it up, okay, so be it. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>posting shit, it doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s something wrong with you or something wrong with what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making. The algorithm is fucking weird. It&rsquo;s a little robot. So don&rsquo;t tell yourself it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like you. It does not know you. It has no personal vendetta against you. It don&rsquo;t personify</p>
<p>it. Okay, it&rsquo;s a fucking little algorithm, whatever. But now I&rsquo;m going to give you an</p>
<p>example about dating and rejection. And when someone doesn&rsquo;t want you, because it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>very easy to be insecure and try and attack yourself and blame yourself. So when you look at</p>
<p>when you like someone, and they don&rsquo;t like you back, or they don&rsquo;t want to be with you. If you</p>
<p>look at that objectively, you do not have to make it mean anything bad about you. You do not have to</p>
<p>attack yourself. Here&rsquo;s a stupid fucking example, but it&rsquo;ll illustrate the point and I might do one</p>
<p>that gets a little deeper, but I&rsquo;m six foot seven. I&rsquo;m fucking tall. Imagine I like this guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s five foot nine. Okay. And I&rsquo;m like, Ooh, I like him. I&rsquo;m really into him. Like, I&rsquo;m everything</p>
<p>he could want. And I like him a lot. Like he&rsquo;s fucking cute. I want to be with him. And like,</p>
<p>why would he not want to be with me? Like, I can see all the reasons he would want to be with me,</p>
<p>you know, like, I&rsquo;d be a great fucking boyfriend. And if this guy comes to me and says he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be with me, I would ask why one but say he just doesn&rsquo;t like tall guys. He&rsquo;s scared of</p>
<p>taller guys. He&rsquo;s not sexually attracted to really fucking gigantic guys like me. He wants someone</p>
<p>more along the same size as him. That does not mean anything about me. It is simply the fact</p>
<p>that he does not prefer something about me. It does not mean it&rsquo;s bad. It does not mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong. What someone prefers and what someone likes is their preference. People are allowed</p>
<p>to have their own preferences. It does not mean that he&rsquo;s attacking me. He&rsquo;s allowed not to like</p>
<p>tall guys. If he wants a guy his size, that&rsquo;s totally fine. Same with someone that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>outgoing. I&rsquo;m a very outgoing personality. Some people might not like that. Some people will</p>
<p>prefer someone that&rsquo;s more of like, introverted and more like a homebody and doesn&rsquo;t socialize</p>
<p>like me, which is totally valid. Old me would have turned the knife at myself and been like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to be so outgoing. You need to fix yourself. And if another guy didn&rsquo;t like the fact</p>
<p>that I was tall, I would be pissed that I was tall because I&rsquo;d be trying to gain the attention</p>
<p>from the person that doesn&rsquo;t want me based off something I can&rsquo;t control instead of going directly</p>
<p>for people that would want me for exactly what I have to offer. Like there&rsquo;s motherfuckers out</p>
<p>there that like tall guys. So if I run across the one short one that I like, but he doesn&rsquo;t like tall</p>
<p>guys, so he doesn&rsquo;t want to be with me. Whoopie shit. Like whoopie fucking shit. It doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>anything wrong about me. I&rsquo;m not internally flawed. He just has a fucking preference. Like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>nothing about that. People want what matches their preferences and people value what meets their</p>
<p>needs. So this boy, if he likes short guys has a need of having a short boyfriend. I can&rsquo;t meet</p>
<p>that need for him. It does not mean I can&rsquo;t meet other needs for him. It does not mean I&rsquo;m useless.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one need that he has that I can&rsquo;t meet. So it makes us incompatible just because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t meet every need for somebody. It does not mean you&rsquo;re useless. You just need to find</p>
<p>the people with the needs that you meet. But if you feel the need to go at yourself and change</p>
<p>yourself for someone, that means that you don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s more people. You&rsquo;re operating</p>
<p>from a mindset of lack and that this is the only motherfucker you&rsquo;ll find that you like. And you</p>
<p>convince yourself this is the only person you could get love from, which is easy to slip into.</p>
<p>But I want to reveal that that&rsquo;s kind of a reflection of childhood and how shit felt back</p>
<p>then. Because for someone like me, my family and my parents, there is a limited amount. There is a</p>
<p>limited amount of people that cared about me when I was younger. And there wasn&rsquo;t any go find another</p>
<p>fucking person to take care of you. All I felt like I had was my family. So I was trained with</p>
<p>that lack mindset of like, what you have, you make it work, because there&rsquo;s no one else that will love</p>
<p>you. And you figure it the fuck out. So like trying to gain approval from my aunt or my dad</p>
<p>or whoever it fucking is, I had one option, which was to change to be what they wanted. And I got</p>
<p>the whole message my whole life that I was fucking useless because I wasn&rsquo;t able to meet the needs of</p>
<p>certain people. But I didn&rsquo;t know that there was other people I could meet needs for and that</p>
<p>mindset will follow you until you break it. So if you think the way that I used to, or you relate</p>
<p>to what I&rsquo;m saying in this, just realize that you are no longer in a house where your options are</p>
<p>limited, where there is only a few people that could care about you. You don&rsquo;t have to change</p>
<p>for them anymore. You don&rsquo;t have to change for people anymore. You&rsquo;re allowed to be yourself.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the biggest gift you can give yourself is to put yourself off the hook for trying</p>
<p>to force every single person to like you and to want you. I get why you did it. But now that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>listened to this podcast, you got to quit it, babe. You got to knock that shit the fuck off because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer in a space of lack. There&rsquo;s so many human beings you could find and access with</p>
<p>needs that you can meet so easily just by being who you are would be enough for them. You just</p>
<p>have to find them. But stop convincing yourself that this one person you like if you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>situation like this is the only motherfucker you&rsquo;re gonna find because there is plenty more.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my little point on rejection is just take it in for two seconds. Just hold on. And you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to change who you are every time someone doesn&rsquo;t like something about you or they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t prefer something about you. Let&rsquo;s just say that. It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t like you start</p>
<p>looking at it like they don&rsquo;t prefer this thing. So no matter what it is, whether you got a big</p>
<p>fucking nose, or you have small lips, or goddamn, I&rsquo;m sorry, baby, if you do. But like, if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just any problem, any like, quirky thing or anything about you, like your personality,</p>
<p>or what you like to do things you enjoy. If someone isn&rsquo;t okay with the fact that you like</p>
<p>that, it doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s anything wrong with you for liking it. They just don&rsquo;t prefer that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay. There&rsquo;s just incompatibility there. If you try to force it and be with them</p>
<p>anyway, that is not going to lead anywhere healthy or good, you will fuck yourself up. Trust me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking from experience, do not try to mold yourself and change into what someone else wants,</p>
<p>go and find the people that want exactly what you have. And I&rsquo;m someone that was like, where the</p>
<p>fuck am I supposed to do that for so long. And then I made a tick tock, and I started fucking</p>
<p>around. And like I said, I just started being myself. And people loved me just for being me.</p>
<p>And I started my podcast and people enjoy me and enjoy hearing what I have to say,</p>
<p>just to hear what I have to say, because it helps them. Like I&rsquo;ve finally found some people that</p>
<p>get me and appreciate me for exactly who I am. Now, if I would have spent my time and energy</p>
<p>trying to fix myself and be everything everybody else wanted me to be, I wouldn&rsquo;t have found you</p>
<p>guys, because I wouldn&rsquo;t have been spending the time and energy I&rsquo;ve spent trying to find you</p>
<p>and putting myself out there so that you guys could find me. I&rsquo;m sure you can think of a ton</p>
<p>of other examples of how this kind of applies. But these are the ones that I&rsquo;ve got. And I hope</p>
<p>this episode was helpful. And I hope you guys learn something. Because this is the thing that</p>
<p>helped me with my whole insecurity thing. Like just look for the other possibilities that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean anything bad about you. When you feel negatively about something, or you feel hurt</p>
<p>by something, that is your signal to question everything you are telling yourself in that</p>
<p>moment. That&rsquo;s the time when you get to reflect and figure out all these things that you&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>yourself that are hurting you. That&rsquo;s when you get to question it. So use the hurt as an alarm bell</p>
<p>to call yourself out and question what the fuck you&rsquo;re telling yourself. This is one of the most</p>
<p>healing things I&rsquo;ve ever done for my relationship with myself, one, and one of the most healing</p>
<p>things I&rsquo;ve ever done for my relationships with other people, because I&rsquo;m no longer fighting for</p>
<p>the attention of people that don&rsquo;t want me. I&rsquo;m no longer trying to prove my worth to people that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want me. Like if you don&rsquo;t see me, if you don&rsquo;t want me, bye. Go ahead and go on somewhere</p>
<p>because I know there&rsquo;s somebody that is. Like once you see that you are valuable, and you are able to</p>
<p>meet needs for people, when people don&rsquo;t appreciate you, it&rsquo;s gonna piss you off. Because you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be like, then get the fuck away from me then, loser. I know it sounds like a little hateful,</p>
<p>but it is. Like if someone doesn&rsquo;t see who I am, bye. You have no clue. You can&rsquo;t even fathom</p>
<p>how much you would benefit from having me in your life, and that&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m not gonna sit here and</p>
<p>prove it to you, because I&rsquo;m not gonna waste my time on someone who doesn&rsquo;t even see what I have</p>
<p>to offer. I&rsquo;m gonna go give that to someone that&rsquo;s deserving, and does see what I have to offer, and</p>
<p>does appreciate me. So yeah, that&rsquo;s my two cents. If you like this podcast, I just have one request,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a five-star rating. Thank you so much. If you want to keep up with me,</p>
<p>all of my social media will be linked in the description of this podcast. Also, if you are</p>
<p>interested in one-on-one coaching with me, I have now created an application process, so it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>longer just free to schedule. I&rsquo;m doing applications now to keep up with the demand, because it just</p>
<p>got too high. So now I&rsquo;m screening people basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit and who&rsquo;s not, because I</p>
<p>want to work with action takers. I want to work with people that are serious about transforming</p>
<p>their life, because the shit that I say, y&rsquo;all know, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for. And where I specialize</p>
<p>is with the people that have been looking for answers they can&rsquo;t find, and the people that have</p>
<p>been trying shit, and it&rsquo;s just not working. I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in that, I will put the link to the application in the description box</p>
<p>also, and I want to make it very clear that you&rsquo;ve already got what it takes to get through what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with, or to improve your life, or to reach your goals, and I&rsquo;ll help you see that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be a lot easier when you got me in your corner, because that&rsquo;s exactly how I want</p>
<p>it to feel. I want it to feel like you have someone that has your back, and like I&rsquo;m in your corner,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it is. Like I&rsquo;m there for you, and I&rsquo;m there to do shit with you. But anyways,</p>
<p>thank you so much for listening. Please stay safe and take care of yourself,</p>
<p>and I will talk to you next Sunday.</p>
