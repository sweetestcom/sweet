low-carb diet but you&amp;rsquo;re still hungry or craving or still have an appetite there&amp;rsquo;s seven reasons why this is uh one of the reasons could be you&amp;rsquo;re just in a habit of eating certain things or some social event and that&amp;rsquo;s so you&amp;rsquo;re not really hungry you&amp;rsquo;re just in the habit of it but if you actually are truly hungry let&amp;rsquo;s go through the list number one you&amp;rsquo;re not doing fasting with your low carb diet if you&amp;rsquo;re eating too frequently you&amp;rsquo;re going to trigger insulin every time you eat and that alone is going to make you hungry i find the majority of the population that starts keto without fasting does not see near the results so include intermittent fasting number two there&amp;rsquo;s hidden carbs you might be doing low carb but if you really look at those carbs maybe you&amp;rsquo;re doing some yogurt which actually has quite a bit of carbs or you might be consuming some keto friendly uh packaged foods or cookies or whatever and there&amp;rsquo;s carbs in there despite it saying it&amp;rsquo;s keto friendly number three your dietary fat is too low i think this one right here is really going to help you if you just start increasing the fat keto is not low fat you want to increase the fat to satisfy you and also so you can fast longer number four you&amp;rsquo;re just not giving enough time so you just did this for a week well you could have insulin resistance and that could take weeks before it really kicks in you should start noticing some changes within even three days but if you don&amp;rsquo;t give it a little bit more time make sure you&amp;rsquo;re doing it correctly and it will work number five your nutrients in your foods are too low you&amp;rsquo;re doing low carb but the quality is not there you&amp;rsquo;re not doing enough uh and i always recommend like a huge salad or vegetables a day that&amp;rsquo;ll give you some nutrients because if you&amp;rsquo;re not and you&amp;rsquo;re not taking supplements you could be hungry just from that because the nutrients signal the hypothalamus in your brain to turn off that hunger number six insulin resistance have more insulin and also your cells will not allow you to absorb nutrients especially like vitamin d vitamin c potassium magnesium so you&amp;rsquo;re not getting those nutrients in to satisfy the brain so realize if you&amp;rsquo;re doing low carb by the book and fasting and you&amp;rsquo;re still hungry this could be the thing which means you need to give it more time and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of other things you can do i&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down below you could have a fatty liver or your gallbladder being removed or some problem with either the gallbladder or the liver and have not enough bile and that means you&amp;rsquo;re not extracting the fat soluble nutrients that are very satisfying to your brain or you&amp;rsquo;re not getting the complete digestion of other things like there are even fat soluble phytonutrients in in plants that are very very beneficial so if you have enough bile you&amp;rsquo;re going to be more satisfied now it&amp;rsquo;s interesting when i was researching this topic i found this study that stated that a high carb diet low fat is more satisfying than a low-carb high-fat diet and i&amp;rsquo;m like wait a second let me just see what foods they&amp;rsquo;re recommending and so i listed them right here here we have a high carb low fat diet compared to a low carb high fat diet okay so this would be more keto and this would be like a standard diet right well i i noticed that the foods that they were testing skim milk against whole milk both of them were doing cereal both were doing white bread but in this group here they were doing a thicker white piece of white bread over here they&amp;rsquo;re doing a medium piece of white bread over here it&amp;rsquo;s egg over here it&amp;rsquo;s egg with margarine really over here we have low-fat margarine versus butter and then we have sugar in both and then over here we have low-fat pizza versus high-fat pizza what is the problem there&amp;rsquo;s too many carbs in both of these diets to be able to do a correct study because in truth this low carb study is not low carb and so this is what really gets me this is why i drink on the weekends no i&amp;rsquo;m just kidding i don&amp;rsquo;t but when you start putting out information in the news that is completely false based on incorrect information like this and sometimes people are going to believe that and then end up doing the wrong thing all right there you go the seven reasons why you are still hungry on a low carb diet hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how

hungry or craving or still have an appetite  </p><p>there&rsquo;s seven reasons why this is uh one of 
the reasons could be you&rsquo;re just in a habit  </p><p>of eating certain things or some social event 
and that&rsquo;s so you&rsquo;re not really hungry you&rsquo;re  </p><p>just in the habit of it but if you actually 
are truly hungry let&rsquo;s go through the list  </p><p>number one you&rsquo;re not doing fasting with your 
low carb diet if you&rsquo;re eating too frequently  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to trigger insulin every time you 
eat and that alone is going to make you hungry  </p><p>i find the majority of the population that starts 
keto without fasting does not see near the results  </p><p>so include intermittent fasting number two 
there&rsquo;s hidden carbs you might be doing low carb  </p><p>but if you really look at those carbs maybe you&rsquo;re 
doing some yogurt which actually has quite a bit  </p><p>of carbs or you might be consuming some keto 
friendly uh packaged foods or cookies or whatever  </p><p>and there&rsquo;s carbs in there despite it saying it&rsquo;s 
keto friendly number three your dietary fat is too  </p><p>low i think this one right here is really going 
to help you if you just start increasing the fat  </p><p>keto is not low fat you want to increase the 
fat to satisfy you and also so you can fast  </p><p>longer number four you&rsquo;re just not giving 
enough time so you just did this for a week  </p><p>well you could have insulin resistance and that 
could take weeks before it really kicks in you  </p><p>should start noticing some changes within even 
three days but if you don&rsquo;t give it a little bit  </p><p>more time make sure you&rsquo;re doing it correctly 
and it will work number five your nutrients in  </p><p>your foods are too low you&rsquo;re doing low carb but 
the quality is not there you&rsquo;re not doing enough  </p><p>uh and i always recommend like a huge salad or 
vegetables a day that&rsquo;ll give you some nutrients  </p><p>because if you&rsquo;re not and you&rsquo;re not taking 
supplements you could be hungry just from that  </p><p>because the nutrients signal the hypothalamus 
in your brain to turn off that hunger number six  </p><p>insulin resistance have more insulin and also 
your cells will not allow you to absorb nutrients  </p><p>especially like vitamin d vitamin c potassium 
magnesium so you&rsquo;re not getting those nutrients  </p><p>in to satisfy the brain so realize if you&rsquo;re doing 
low carb by the book and fasting and you&rsquo;re still  </p><p>hungry this could be the thing which means you 
need to give it more time and there&rsquo;s a lot of  </p><p>other things you can do i&rsquo;ll put a link down below 
you could have a fatty liver or your gallbladder  </p><p>being removed or some problem with either the 
gallbladder or the liver and have not enough bile  </p><p>and that means you&rsquo;re not extracting the fat 
soluble nutrients that are very satisfying to your  </p><p>brain or you&rsquo;re not getting the complete digestion 
of other things like there are even fat soluble  </p><p>phytonutrients in in plants that are very very 
beneficial so if you have enough bile you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to be more satisfied now it&rsquo;s interesting when 
i was researching this topic i found this study  </p><p>that stated that a high carb diet low fat is 
more satisfying than a low-carb high-fat diet  </p><p>and i&rsquo;m like wait a second let me just see what 
foods they&rsquo;re recommending and so i listed them  </p><p>right here here we have a high carb low fat 
diet compared to a low carb high fat diet  </p><p>okay so this would be more keto and this would 
be like a standard diet right well i i noticed  </p><p>that the foods that they were testing skim milk 
against whole milk both of them were doing cereal  </p><p>both were doing white bread but in this 
group here they were doing a thicker  </p><p>white piece of white bread over here they&rsquo;re 
doing a medium piece of white bread over here  </p><p>it&rsquo;s egg over here it&rsquo;s egg with margarine 
really over here we have low-fat margarine  </p><p>versus butter and then we have sugar in both 
and then over here we have low-fat pizza  </p><p>versus high-fat pizza what is the problem 
there&rsquo;s too many carbs in both of these  </p><p>diets to be able to do a correct study because in 
truth this low carb study is not low carb and so  </p><p>this is what really gets me this is why i drink on 
the weekends no i&rsquo;m just kidding i don&rsquo;t but when  </p><p>you start putting out information in the news that 
is completely false based on incorrect information  </p><p>like this and sometimes people are going to 
believe that and then end up doing the wrong  </p><p>thing all right there you go the seven reasons 
why you are still hungry on a low carb diet  </p><p>hey before you go real quick i have 
a course entitled how to bulletproof  </p><p>your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course 
i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to 
bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate  </p><p>and resist your environment much better by 
strengthening your own immune system i put  </p><p>a link down in the description right down
