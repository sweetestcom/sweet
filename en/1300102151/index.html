<p>anyway ryan</p>
<p>playing it clean now that he&rsquo;s doing films</p>
<p>major films just gotta watch the image</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny when you do</p>
<p>major films for those of you guys don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think i just came back from thailand</p>
<p>doing a hangover too a little movie</p>
<p>but but it&rsquo;s funny because when you</p>
<p>and we talked about this man</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;d finally do the</p>
<p>big film you know you&rsquo;re doing this big film and stuff</p>
<p>and and you know it</p>
<p>like your whole like</p>
<p>your desire</p>
<p>is to do something that you&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>watched so you want to be the guy with the</p>
<p>sweaty shirt with the gun</p>
<p>tears coming down your face on a railroad</p>
<p>track with the wind blowing your hair back</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>final confrontation when you have the</p>
<p>shootout that scene</p>
<p>that scene in your fantasy takes six days</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shooting a half a page a day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what acting</p>
<p>in a film is you&rsquo;re just sitting around while they</p>
<p>spray your shirt</p>
<p>well is the</p>
<p>sweat isn&rsquo;t really working it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the same as the shot before we got to change your</p>
<p>shirt give us a</p>
<p>minute that</p>
<p>light&rsquo;s not working we got</p>
<p>can you stand to the left a little bit brunt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what doing a big film is really</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s fun though because you end up</p>
<p>hanging out</p>
<p>with some fun people on this you can&rsquo;t really complain</p>
<p>about doing big</p>
<p>movies dude people don&rsquo;t want to hear that shit sorry</p>
<p>erased it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>erasing over too and it sucks</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t suck i had a</p>
<p>great time what&rsquo;s the best gig in hollywood do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a tv show well</p>
<p>the best gig</p>
<p>for like as far as like comfort life comfort</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>said i think there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a sitcom because you work ten minutes a week</p>
<p>and and you make a fortune see for me</p>
<p>doing a sitcom</p>
<p>is cake because then</p>
<p>i can go do</p>
<p>stand up on the weekends and make</p>
<p>tv money doing that yeah yeah</p>
<p>i mean the best gig in hollywood the best</p>
<p>gig in the show business is either being a rock star</p>
<p>or being a stand up comic</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not sure what beats what</p>
<p>but you know there&rsquo;s nothing like doing</p>
<p>stand up rock stars can</p>
<p>break up the problem is they have to rely on a</p>
<p>bunch of other dudes that&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>right and i</p>
<p>think also you know when you&rsquo;re like a</p>
<p>major rock star you&rsquo;ve been singing the same song</p>
<p>for 30 years that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta get a little</p>
<p>tiring it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be a weird</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s totally reverse of comedians</p>
<p>cause with rock stars nobody ever wants to hear</p>
<p>their new shit</p>
<p>nobody wants to hear the new rolling</p>
<p>stone songs</p>
<p>no they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stop do that</p>
<p>start me up song yeah</p>
<p>but with comedy</p>
<p>would comedy</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t want to hear old shit they want to hear</p>
<p>some new shit</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s some new</p>
<p>shit it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>magic trick</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like you got to surprise them that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>people have</p>
<p>to constantly</p>
<p>to be coming up with new material but isn&rsquo;t that a</p>
<p>funny thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the rock stars get pigeonholed into doing</p>
<p>all their best old creations and we</p>
<p>right we have to that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>david lee roth</p>
<p>when they fired him from van halen</p>
<p>he goes all i know is</p>
<p>sammy hager&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta sing jump for the next 20 years</p>
<p>jump that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem with rock stars man i&rsquo;m not saying that it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>awesome to be a rock star but you have to find a</p>
<p>group of people who</p>
<p>agree to hang out and be cool with each</p>
<p>other in the mid</p>
<p>midst of like the biggest ego explosion in</p>
<p>humanity&rsquo;s history</p>
<p>rockstar you</p>
<p>get it that&rsquo;s the big that&rsquo;s the top of the food chain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the top of</p>
<p>the vagina food chain</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>doubt fuck yeah it is are you kidding me</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s making them orgasm emotionally saying all the</p>
<p>right shit with the</p>
<p>right tone the</p>
<p>right amount of</p>
<p>sensitivity it&rsquo;s</p>

<p>thing they do is get</p>
<p>monkeys and</p>

<p>eagle they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>enormous and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a documentary on youtube it</p>
<p>is the shit and i&rsquo;ve thought of you immediately because</p>
<p>you and i are both retards when it comes to animals</p>
<p>i have never had</p>
<p>more dude have you</p>
<p>heard about</p>
<p>these fucking lions</p>
<p>we never had</p>
<p>these conversations with anybody more than with you</p>
<p>because you and i just sync up</p>
<p>and we both kick it to the next</p>
<p>level of retard</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t get enough i can&rsquo;t get enough oh my god</p>
<p>because that you remember the conversation we had</p>
<p>about those lions the</p>
<p>super lions in africa</p>
<p>that eat the</p>
<p>water buffalo yeah</p>
<p>the giant lions yes you know that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about brian</p>
<p>kevin and i were in like retard fever</p>
<p>pitch right</p>
<p>well they used</p>
<p>to always thinker than males</p>
<p>the females are bigger than males they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giant muscled lions</p>
<p>we were both like holy fuck this is fucking insane</p>
<p>you just get so worked up</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s why i got so obsessed with</p>
<p>those chimps</p>
<p>those huge 400</p>
<p>pound chimps</p>
<p>those lion eater</p>
<p>chimps they found</p>
<p>leopard meat in</p>
<p>their feces</p>
<p>what oh and by the way they howl</p>
<p>apparently and they fish with</p>
<p>their own bare hands</p>
<p>and they are all gray</p>
<p>yeah you know that they&rsquo;re big no</p>
<p>i did not see</p>
<p>gray chimps the</p>
<p>older ones they&rsquo;re gray</p>
<p>look listen</p>
<p>just like in that</p>
<p>movie congo</p>
<p>yeah and let me explain something to you</p>
<p>when you buy</p>
<p>a chimp if anybody wants to buy a chimp i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna call here&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want something with</p>
<p>seven times the</p>
<p>upper body strength of a</p>
<p>grown man with a</p>
<p>three year old&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brain that&rsquo;s prone to rage</p>
<p>because they go for the face</p>
<p>and the genitals fucking</p>
<p>christ yeah that&rsquo;s what they do</p>
<p>the guy at the san</p>
<p>diego zoo goes</p>
<p>no chimp says</p>
<p>solve everything with violence they go for the face</p>
<p>and the genitals</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t want you to breed so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty vindictive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>they really are like</p>
<p>a 500 pound man</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what they say a</p>
<p>chimp would</p>
<p>be a well let</p>
<p>me give you an example</p>
<p>they took 140</p>
<p>pound female in the bronx</p>
<p>zoo a long time ago</p>
<p>140 pounds okay</p>
<p>now male chimps get up to about 200</p>
<p>pounds this is</p>
<p>140 pound female</p>
<p>adolescent they</p>
<p>taught her that the</p>
<p>more she pulled with one hand they strapped her to a</p>
<p>chair the more she pulled with one hand</p>
<p>she had the</p>
<p>sweeter the</p>
<p>fruit they give her</p>
<p>an apple and give her a mango</p>
<p>she pulled 1200</p>
<p>pounds with one hand she rode</p>
<p>1200 pounds with one hand now think</p>
<p>about that for a</p>
<p>second dudes who</p>
<p>are who are doing the</p>
<p>upright row with</p>
<p>350 they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>monsters they&rsquo;re huge</p>
<p>1200 pounds</p>
<p>her tensile strength</p>
<p>they did a tensile strength</p>
<p>thing where they</p>
<p>chest your grip</p>
<p>so the 160 pound man has</p>
<p>a hundred and</p>
<p>ok what was it</p>
<p>it was like 300 pounds or</p>
<p>actually 200</p>
<p>pounds of tensile strength</p>
<p>she had twelve hundred</p>
<p>pounds of pencil</p>
<p>strength as well she</p>
<p>could squeeze</p>
<p>you know a ball</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know we are so fucking weak we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pussies we&rsquo;re such i was fleshy</p>
<p>i was shitty</p>
<p>pussies i spent</p>
<p>three weeks in indonesia rehabilitating orangutans okay</p>
<p>i was around</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s pronounced orangutan</p>
<p>dude you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>scientist i&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>smart you guys holy shit that</p>
<p>means person of the forest in</p>
<p>indonesian you guys</p>
<p>learn a lot this is</p>
<p>about education</p>
<p>too it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the education yo</p>
<p>yeah but meanwhile the</p>
<p>community is strong</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy back to bangkok</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a hundred forty</p>
<p>pound female</p>
<p>uh correct so a two hundred</p>
<p>pound male well how about</p>
<p>four hundred</p>
<p>pound fucking</p>
<p>chart yeah how</p>
<p>about a four hundred</p>
<p>pound male the the huge one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>call him lion killers correct they did the</p>
<p>most recent expeditions actually caught one eating a</p>
<p>leopard they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if it killed it</p>
<p>but they observed them eating</p>
<p>it and they&rsquo;re very elusive man they&rsquo;ve actually never</p>
<p>i guess they&rsquo;ve only seen like a couple in the</p>
<p>wild yeah they&rsquo;ve only seen a few in the wild and they</p>
<p>sleep on the</p>
<p>ground they nest on the ground just like gorillas who</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a fuck exactly</p>
<p>good luck everybody</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy cause it&rsquo;s only a very very</p>
<p>small part of the congo</p>
<p>and that part is all</p>
<p>filled with civil war</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s very dangerous so it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>explore these guys</p>
<p>and to get to em</p>
<p>you gotta go straight through rainforest on foot</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the only way to</p>
<p>get to em yeah</p>
<p>impenetrable it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>and once you&rsquo;re in there man</p>
<p>dude good fucking luck</p>
<p>good luck with poisonous</p>
<p>spiders snakes</p>
<p>and insects that</p>
<p>will eat you out from the ear out they will</p>
<p>climb into your ears and eat your fucking brains</p>
<p>millions of them</p>
<p>streams of ass</p>
<p>they take down elephants man yeah</p>
<p>they did have you</p>
<p>heard of those</p>
<p>spiders that</p>
<p>are like that big that are over in like a rack</p>
<p>right now that</p>
<p>you like camel spider yeah</p>
<p>we fed people</p>
<p>those on fear factor that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucked up where it like</p>
<p>none they eat those</p>
<p>they eat them live no yes they did yeah</p>
<p>if it numbs you</p>
<p>i would never be on that show</p>
<p>you gotta grab em the</p>
<p>right way it&rsquo;s amazing what people do for like</p>
<p>fame i&rsquo;ll eat</p>
<p>a camel spider and get stung in my face yeah</p>
<p>pretty ridiculous</p>
<p>yeah getting stung on the roof of my</p>
<p>mouth can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there was a lot of shit we did with bugs it was</p>
<p>ridiculous scorpions</p>
<p>we made people lie in a</p>
<p>thing as scorpions just get jacked by scorpions</p>
<p>they got tongue and</p>
<p>stuff yeah oh</p>
<p>yeah those big</p>
<p>black ones that look</p>
<p>really scary yeah yeah</p>
<p>those apparently are not as dangerous</p>
<p>the really dangerous ones are the</p>
<p>small brown ones</p>
<p>right some of the</p>
<p>small brown ones</p>
<p>but the big</p>
<p>black ones it&rsquo;s like a bee sting what were</p>
<p>those fluorescent ones they were like</p>
<p>green caterpillars</p>
<p>that just burst</p>
<p>every time somebody</p>
<p>would chew on them</p>
<p>like there was huge oh</p>
<p>tomato hornworms</p>
<p>yeah those things are</p>
<p>crazy fluorescent</p>
<p>green it was</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re in the wild</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the wild is there any bug you can&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p>
<p>when when bugs are really</p>
<p>bright bright and</p>
<p>colorful you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>most of the time that&rsquo;s a big warning yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big warning that there&rsquo;s some poison in this</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>look at this</p>
<p>bitch bit back the fuck up you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you eat me it&rsquo;s both of us</p>
<p>yeah suicide bombers</p>
<p>you eat them and that&rsquo;s really what it is it&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>discourage predation nature&rsquo;s pornstar</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to eat</p>
<p>caterpillars</p>
<p>apparently those are</p>
<p>those really</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really they&rsquo;re really bright and pretty</p>
<p>yeah or hornets</p>
<p>caterpillars</p>
<p>all those fucking</p>
<p>things we&rsquo;re just so</p>
<p>lucky they&rsquo;re small fuck</p>
<p>would you imagine if hornets were</p>
<p>giant like a horse</p>
<p>if a hornet was the size of a fucking horse</p>
<p>dude we would have</p>
<p>never evolved to this</p>
<p>point because hornets</p>
<p>would just come down and just jack</p>
<p>you bite your fucking head off and eat your body yeah</p>
<p>they would just do that they</p>
<p>would just do that and there</p>
<p>would be nothing you can do</p>
<p>about it we</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>develop to the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>those animals</p>
<p>existed unless we</p>
<p>learned how to ride them</p>
<p>no we would just be</p>
<p>fine as fuck</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>for that goddamn asteroid that killed all the dinosaurs</p>
<p>we would never have gotten to this position</p>
<p>we had to start from scratch</p>
<p>and then have</p>
<p>a new race with the mammals to</p>
<p>try to get to the top of the food chain</p>
<p>if there was</p>
<p>giant flying fucking hornets the size of</p>
<p>horses we would have</p>
<p>never made it this far</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d have to go walk around with a</p>
<p>flamethrower i don&rsquo;t know if that would work</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if that works on a regular hornet</p>
<p>those things are no joke yeah man</p>
<p>they would find you if they fond</p>
<p>you like in</p>
<p>a big fucking</p>
<p>swarm of them</p>
<p>found you found out</p>
<p>where the people are</p>
<p>you ever watch that</p>
<p>video there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these gigantic hornets</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>japanese japanese i know</p>
<p>about you want to</p>
<p>go to that please let&rsquo;s go watch</p>
<p>it 50 times fucking you</p>
<p>mean the six</p>
<p>japanese yellow hornets they&rsquo;re the biggest</p>
<p>member of the hornet family</p>
<p>that came in and killed</p>
<p>thirty thousand bees in a period of three</p>
<p>hours that we</p>
<p>that video heads off</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>thirty thousand bees</p>
<p>it would would be the youtube</p>
<p>search for that japanese hornets</p>
<p>just go to kill be i</p>
<p>go to go to go to hornets</p>
<p>versus bees</p>
<p>hornets versus bees</p>
<p>you gotta see this</p>
<p>and imagine</p>
<p>if they were big</p>
<p>and by the way</p>
<p>these things they have</p>
<p>close up on this</p>
<p>thing and you watch</p>
<p>these bees doing whatever they can and the only time</p>
<p>this is what&rsquo;s so creepy</p>
<p>those japanese</p>
<p>hornets what they&rsquo;ll do is they&rsquo;ll send a scout out</p>
<p>and when the</p>
<p>scout sees the hive</p>
<p>it drops like a hormone like a scent</p>
<p>trail on the hive and then goes flying back to its nest</p>
<p>and then and then</p>
<p>the troops come out</p>
<p>and they come out and then they just they just eat</p>
<p>all the bees</p>
<p>now what they do but sometimes what the bees</p>
<p>get they get lucky</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;ll do sometimes</p>
<p>is they will actually</p>
<p>when they get when</p>
<p>the hornet&rsquo;s walking around like it&rsquo;s doing right now</p>
<p>sometimes the bees will jump on it</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t sting it because</p>
<p>its armor is too thick</p>
<p>what they do is they</p>
<p>start flapping</p>
<p>their wings around it</p>
<p>and they create</p>
<p>so much heat around the hornet that the hornet dies</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too hot and that&rsquo;s the only time if you can kill the</p>
<p>scout before he goes back</p>
<p>your your your colony will survive if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re all dead holy shit</p>
<p>yeah look at how</p>
<p>big it is look</p>
<p>at how big it is you have to see this it looks like a</p>
<p>spaceship and just</p>
<p>wrap your head around what the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on we i</p>
<p>think we discount the insane</p>
<p>complexity of the insect</p>
<p>world because they&rsquo;re so little</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right but if they were big</p>
<p>what a fucking trip</p>
<p>this would be they&rsquo;re so incredibly organized it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>lucky they&rsquo;re little</p>
<p>i mean it could have easily</p>
<p>turned out that</p>
<p>these things were birds</p>
<p>you know giant birds well</p>
<p>did pterodactyls and things yeah</p>
<p>the dinosaurs were</p>
<p>essentially the birds are</p>
<p>their closest relatives they said so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interesting theory that i read recently</p>
<p>about dinosaurs</p>
<p>that they believe that the size of dinosaurs</p>
<p>is so ineffective</p>
<p>given our current</p>
<p>atmosphere that they</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possibly evidence that there was a different</p>
<p>atmosphere on earth</p>
<p>when a different</p>
<p>density to the</p>
<p>atmosphere on</p>
<p>earth well i imagine they were cold</p>
<p>blooded so it&rsquo;d probably have to be warmer than it was</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>like crocodiles</p>
<p>i mean if you you see that documentary called</p>
<p>here be dragons</p>
<p>where you got</p>
<p>those crocs that actually bite</p>
<p>wildebeest around the midsection and take them</p>
<p>in fucking good</p>
<p>video when the wildebeest</p>
<p>walks up to the pond they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking and it just explodes</p>
<p>loads out of the pond that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like thousands of</p>
<p>pounds but that is that&rsquo;s a dinosaur</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as close to a dinosaur as you get</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible that that thing is</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>they keep living</p>
<p>and by the way they keep growing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this condition with a reptile like that</p>
<p>where they will just keep growing</p>
<p>the more they</p>
<p>eat the bigger they get</p>
<p>where they eat cows</p>
<p>yeah and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain sinister quality to the crocodile</p>
<p>that makes it look more sinister than an alligator</p>
<p>like even you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a longer</p>
<p>sharper snout</p>
<p>and you know alligators have that</p>
<p>round kind of</p>
<p>round or snout and</p>
<p>they tend to eat fish and</p>
<p>smaller animals tend to but they fucking eat people in</p>
<p>around here too</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>guy got killed who was on</p>
<p>running from the cops</p>
<p>he crashed his cars like a dui in florida really</p>
<p>running from the cops</p>
<p>jumps out of his car jumps into the water</p>
<p>just as he jumps into</p>
<p>the wall of the alligator grabs him and fucks him up</p>
<p>right in front of the cops</p>
<p>is that true yeah</p>
<p>i was in i was in</p>
<p>marco island doing</p>
<p>standup and there&rsquo;s an area in</p>
<p>marco island off of naples that has the biggest</p>
<p>saltwater crocodile</p>
<p>reserve american crocodiles</p>
<p>and there are signs all over don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>swimming do not get out of your boat</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be careful when you&rsquo;re fishing all that stuff</p>
<p>if there are crocodiles anywhere in the area</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going fishing no</p>
<p>no no we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going hiking</p>
<p>well all you have to do is tap them in the</p>
<p>snout and they&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>fuck out of here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the that&rsquo;s the biggest lie when they only talk</p>
<p>about when i when a</p>
<p>shark attacks you hit him in the nose</p>
<p>they kill sea lions with</p>
<p>their mouths</p>
<p>travis like hitting the</p>
<p>chevy on that on the</p>
<p>mouth when it&rsquo;s coming at you at thirty</p>
<p>miles an hour i&rsquo;m on the hood of the on the hood</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>stuff that bumps</p>
<p>their nose please they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fuck you up that&rsquo;s just some</p>
<p>meanwhile there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that guy that rides</p>
<p>great whites how</p>
<p>about that guy that rides</p>
<p>great whites it&rsquo;s a guy who rides great</p>
<p>whites from</p>
<p>south africa</p>
<p>he was snorkeling with</p>
<p>eight great</p>
<p>whites in the</p>
<p>water and then rode a</p>
<p>22 footer shut the fuck up</p>
<p>speaking of</p>
<p>which david blaine</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i can say this because he i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be part of a show but</p>
<p>he does a thing with</p>
<p>great whites that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy dude you just gave it away i can&rsquo;t even believe</p>
<p>you did that</p>
<p>no but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s nothing it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not giving anything away</p>
<p>but he does some he showed me some pretty cool stuff</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll drop big names on this podcast</p>
<p>if i want the</p>
<p>whole animal</p>
<p>world man we so take it for</p>
<p>granted because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>pretty much isolated ourselves from it with cities</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first thing that really</p>
<p>struck me when i was living in</p>
<p>colorado was how</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re connected</p>
<p>to the wild</p>
<p>world there</p>
<p>you cannot remove the wild</p>
<p>world from colorado</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re driving through town in evergreen</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these photos of</p>
<p>like elk herds that</p>
<p>mosey through town hundreds of elk</p>
<p>thousand pound</p>
<p>wild animals</p>
<p>wild cattle</p>
<p>basically right that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>through the fucking forest and walking down the main</p>
<p>street and clogging</p>
<p>up traffic i mean it&rsquo;s a trip i was in</p>
<p>ohio one time i was</p>
<p>swimming and</p>
<p>i watched these porpoises</p>
<p>like i could i</p>
<p>could hear them because they were probably 50 feet away</p>
<p>and they just passed me</p>
<p>not dolphins but those huge</p>
<p>purple porpoises just</p>
<p>and one of them service went</p>
<p>and breathe through it</p>
<p>and i just felt</p>
<p>so insignificant it was like a locomotive</p>
<p>like just a</p>
<p>bunch of locomotives just</p>
<p>gliding through it was</p>
<p>crazy so i called to them</p>
<p>no the trip</p>
<p>about dolphins is that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so intelligent yeah and they have wars with each</p>
<p>other and you can see it when you&rsquo;re looking at them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>weird connection</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re communicating with a dolphin</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re by</p>
<p>a boat and they&rsquo;re jumping up and looking at you</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to play with you and have fun with you</p>
<p>one there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you connecting to them somehow or another</p>
<p>i think what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>about the more</p>
<p>intelligent the animal for example chimpanzees</p>
<p>even certain birds but</p>
<p>especially dolphins</p>
<p>the more organized and more violent they are with each</p>
<p>other like dolphins will wage war on</p>
<p>other dolphin</p>
<p>pods and kill entire pods</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>until they you know created this documentary on it</p>
<p>where they actually have they sent out</p>
<p>like warring parties it&rsquo;s exactly like chimps if chimps</p>
<p>have one area of a forest and there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>family of chimps in another area</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll send males out</p>
<p>that will look for</p>
<p>other males from the</p>
<p>other try and kill them it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>the only ones that do war in animal kingdom not at all</p>
<p>not at all that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always said to people man you got to be really careful</p>
<p>about wanting the fucking</p>
<p>aliens to land</p>
<p>mm hmm just look at the history</p>
<p>of what every</p>
<p>smart thing has done to</p>
<p>everything not as smart</p>
<p>all over earth</p>
<p>every single opportunity</p>
<p>nature has had</p>
<p>to express itself</p>
<p>the stronger</p>
<p>smarter things</p>
<p>fuck the weaker</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s the argument against</p>
<p>technology in</p>
<p>some ways for a lot of computer scientists when you</p>
<p>start creating computers that are</p>
<p>smarter than</p>
<p>we are and they</p>
<p>start making computers</p>
<p>smarter than they are which is</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>start developing what&rsquo;s called will</p>
<p>that the question is are they</p>
<p>gonna have respect for</p>
<p>their biological heritage</p>
<p>yeah i mean look all over the what</p>
<p>the intelligent animals that we know chimpanzees eat</p>
<p>monkeys all</p>
<p>right killer</p>
<p>whales eat dolphins they kill and eat dolphins man</p>
<p>and we do whatever the fuck we want to do to</p>
<p>everything underneath us why</p>
<p>are we expecting the</p>
<p>aliens to be so evolved</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re past the</p>
<p>whole rule of nature</p>
<p>that expresses itself</p>
<p>over and over</p>
<p>again wherever we are</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s intelligent</p>
<p>takes advantage of</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s not as intelligent</p>
<p>absolutely it&rsquo;s just the way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not as</p>
<p>strong or not as</p>
<p>powerful and</p>
<p>human beings do it to</p>
<p>other human beings</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t we expect the</p>
<p>aliens to just come down here and just fuck with us</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s a will to</p>
<p>power i think it</p>
<p>exists i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be ready</p>
<p>brian what would you do if the</p>
<p>aliens landed</p>
<p>what would you do if it all turned out to be real</p>
<p>and that we have been monitored from</p>
<p>space by invisible aircrafts that well it depends</p>
<p>how they come like if they just slowly land and go like</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m in the aliens</p>
<p>i just landed i&rsquo;ll probably like hey what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you know but if they just like blow up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be funny if they were really huge</p>
<p>they were really had to come back</p>
<p>hey guys what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on we&rsquo;re the aliens</p>
<p>and nothing</p>
<p>well what if</p>
<p>they got to a</p>
<p>point where they realized they had</p>
<p>to step in because we were fucking up the resources of</p>
<p>this world so bad</p>
<p>they had to reveal themselves</p>
<p>again it would have to be</p>
<p>their body language</p>
<p>you know if they&rsquo;re like just coming up to me</p>
<p>going like hey we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to step in here</p>
<p>and then you guys are</p>
<p>too okay i&rsquo;m like okay i guess</p>
<p>you could do it try it</p>
<p>again try it out go for it</p>
<p>i asked him</p>
<p>to do something about jet</p>
<p>travel you don&rsquo;t want it to take less time it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>right now you know it&rsquo;s only a day dude</p>
<p>relax everybody</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not fucking</p>
<p>start teleporting each</p>
<p>other halfway from here to there</p>
<p>thailand thailand was like</p>
<p>27 hours i don&rsquo;t know what that was</p>
<p>is there like weird like just</p>
<p>things everywhere you went around there</p>
<p>yeah bangkok&rsquo;s interesting because it&rsquo;s like this very</p>
<p>very hot hot tropical city</p>
<p>with a lot of</p>
<p>pollution and a lot of people it&rsquo;s just chaos</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s interesting and if you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>underage sex for 60 bucks then</p>

<p>or i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it was and he&rsquo;s a straight up doctor</p>
<p>and then started just taking acting</p>
<p>classes and doing</p>
<p>stand up and he&rsquo;s just hilarious</p>
<p>and fearless</p>
<p>and he just hasn&rsquo;t stopped working</p>

<p>break out of being</p>
<p>a a doctor he just was like he was</p>
<p>just like i don&rsquo;t really like being a doctor that much</p>
<p>when he was acting and doing all</p>
<p>these movies he was</p>
<p>still he had a practice</p>
<p>wow he was still doing like you know yeah</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s his wife is a practicing doctor too holy shit</p>
<p>how many people are like</p>
<p>that they just wanted to do something else but they</p>
<p>fucking never went for it</p>
<p>they got stuck</p>

<p>gonna become a movie star</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s good man</p>
<p>he is he&rsquo;ll be working forever forever yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s your go to guy yeah for sure he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hilarious and he&rsquo;s really fun to work with that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other thing i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>say the guys that work a lot like giamatti</p>
<p>and those guys</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just really good people they&rsquo;re just a</p>
<p>blast they just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just very giving</p>
<p>they listen to you they</p>
<p>react to you they just happen to be there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not cynical</p>
<p>about it kevin</p>
<p>james i did his</p>
<p>movie zookeeper and</p>
<p>his whole staff like</p>
<p>everybody who&rsquo;s working on the</p>
<p>movie is so friendly oh they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s like so nice and everyone is like</p>
<p>really appreciative of everyone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a nice</p>
<p>fun working environment</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like seamless because of that and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>kevin&rsquo;s that way</p>
<p>kevin&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>it comes right</p>
<p>it all comes down from him</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like it makes</p>
<p>things so much better</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>really like when you&rsquo;re working with people that</p>
<p>appreciate what&rsquo;s happening and</p>
<p>appreciate what they&rsquo;re doing or</p>
<p>appreciate each other</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a fun</p>
<p>positive environment because it&rsquo;s called perspective</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why reading</p>
<p>history instead of being late not talking</p>
<p>about intellectual but just getting a</p>
<p>sense of what came before you</p>
<p>and how most people throughout all of history lived</p>
<p>short miserable</p>
<p>lives because they didn&rsquo;t have access to i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>antibiotics vaccines</p>
<p>cat scans all</p>
<p>things that let us go beyond our bodies</p>
<p>running water</p>
<p>i mean it just goes on and on</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;d lose</p>
<p>three or you&rsquo;re like lincoln lost his kid to a fever</p>
<p>how many famous people lost</p>
<p>their children</p>
<p>three of their children at a time to</p>
<p>things like diphtheria and stuff</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t even heard of</p>
<p>and so when you have a perspective of how</p>
<p>lucky you are as just somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s never missed a meal for example</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything to get what they want</p>
<p>just stay warm</p>
<p>and stay safe and have representative government</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to complain about</p>
<p>nothing man</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s certainly something to complain</p>
<p>about cause it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta evolve and get better you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be satisfied with the way it is that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely fucked up</p>
<p>i wanna know what you think</p>
<p>about all this</p>
<p>crazy wikileak shit</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a trip isn&rsquo;t it yeah and the debate</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an interesting but before you say anything</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>story that came up from the new york</p>
<p>or rolling stone</p>
<p>magazine said</p>
<p>if the new york times had received the same information</p>
<p>which is basically all wikileaks did</p>
<p>would we be prosecuting them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fundamental question is this</p>
<p>you had a private</p>
<p>who made all this information</p>
<p>available and the private was in</p>
<p>direct violation of military</p>
<p>code that when you when you join the military</p>
<p>take an oath and and</p>
<p>that private could be</p>
<p>tried for treason because what he</p>
<p>did is he took sensitive information not top secret but</p>
<p>secret information and he let it and he just</p>
<p>basically deliberately</p>
<p>leaked it now i</p>
<p>agree julia</p>
<p>julian assange</p>
<p>he if it&rsquo;s proven in</p>
<p>court and this is probably gonna be</p>
<p>the defense&rsquo;s platform</p>
<p>if julian assange</p>
<p>just said look i was</p>
<p>given this information and i provided a platform</p>
<p>for that information not unlike</p>
<p>and this is exactly what the new york times did</p>
<p>they provide now the new york times what they did was</p>
<p>they actually edited out</p>
<p>certain names of people</p>
<p>that could be put into harm&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>if it was found out they were helping</p>
<p>the enemy in</p>
<p>those countries so in</p>
<p>other words</p>
<p>if the cia has certain people we pay</p>
<p>to get information</p>
<p>as soon as their names are put out on the internet</p>
<p>they are they can be</p>
<p>their lives can be in danger</p>
<p>because the host country or the country that they</p>
<p>belong to or that they&rsquo;re betraying or whatever they</p>
<p>would put them in jail or kill him or whatever it</p>
<p>might be so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the dilemma</p>
<p>really comes when you just dump a</p>
<p>bunch of information out</p>
<p>it can have repercussions did they send to the names of</p>
<p>operatives the new york times did the wikileaks did no</p>
<p>julian sans just took all that info and just let it out</p>
<p>really so he let out names of operatives in different</p>
<p>countries everything he even gave</p>
<p>social security numbers and addresses of soldiers and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>and the problem with that is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one side of the argument that says look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>transparency</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re an operative</p>
<p>if you work for the cia there&rsquo;s always that risk you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be compromised okay that&rsquo;s one idea</p>
<p>but the other issue is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all for transparency i certainly am i&rsquo;m for</p>
<p>transparency of government</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important you don&rsquo;t want to give any</p>
<p>any agency in government too much</p>
<p>power because like any</p>
<p>human beings just</p>
<p>about natural</p>
<p>human issues</p>
<p>they just become</p>
<p>their own gang and they get as much power and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the brilliance of the</p>
<p>founding fathers was creating</p>
<p>all different departments</p>
<p>that are competing against</p>
<p>each other the</p>
<p>state department has</p>
<p>their agenda and they&rsquo;re always trying to</p>
<p>undermine the department of defense</p>
<p>department of defense has its own problems with the</p>
<p>executive and that&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>thing because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t let anybody have too much power</p>
<p>but at the end of the day if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take just a bunch of info</p>
<p>and just dump it</p>
<p>in some ways i think it has</p>
<p>first of all it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spiteful and i&rsquo;m not sure what the</p>
<p>point is if you want transparency that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be that irresponsible and put people</p>
<p>lives at stake who are trying to do</p>
<p>good work personal information and they&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>good work out there you know when i was in afghanistan</p>
<p>those guys most of</p>
<p>those soldiers i was around were</p>
<p>building hospitals</p>
<p>and schools</p>
<p>say what you will</p>
<p>about the war</p>
<p>say what you will</p>
<p>about the motives and things but</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an intelligent debate to be had</p>
<p>about the united</p>
<p>states not getting involved in</p>
<p>other countries</p>
<p>affairs and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard these</p>
<p>things but the</p>
<p>point becomes</p>
<p>what are you trying to</p>
<p>accomplish when you dump all that information out there</p>
<p>and what one of the repercussions</p>
<p>might very well be that government</p>
<p>agencies have a</p>
<p>tough time getting information</p>
<p>from valuable sources overseas</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in cases of</p>
<p>espionage or whether it&rsquo;s case of national security</p>
<p>a lot of people now are</p>
<p>gonna go i don&rsquo;t want to talk to you dude</p>
<p>i talk to you and i</p>
<p>might get leaked</p>
<p>because you have no guarantee that you can keep</p>
<p>these correspondence</p>
<p>secret it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing to embarrass politicians</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing that vladimir putin</p>
<p>is called a guy who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have as much control over his government all</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;ll get over that</p>
<p>diplomatically</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing when very valuable</p>
<p>sources of information for the united</p>
<p>states all of a</p>
<p>sudden are compromised and then</p>
<p>field operatives</p>
<p>who are trying to make the</p>
<p>world a safer</p>
<p>place all of a</p>
<p>sudden have very</p>
<p>tough time recruiting anybody</p>
<p>because nobody want people like i tell you a</p>
<p>secret man and my name now is all of a</p>
<p>sudden on you know</p>
<p>in the new york times no</p>
<p>thanks or it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the web and on a website</p>
<p>and my and the people that i&rsquo;m betraying</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first place they look and they come to my</p>
<p>house and kill me and my family nah</p>
<p>sorry find another guy i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not working for you</p>
<p>so that that that becomes an issue</p>
<p>and there are a lot of</p>
<p>other issues i</p>
<p>think that we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really even</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see what this what this means</p>
<p>these things take time</p>
<p>the ripple effect takes some time</p>
<p>do you think that there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>way that the</p>
<p>private the guy who leaked the information the guy who</p>
<p>in effect committed treason</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any way that you</p>
<p>could argue that</p>
<p>if he thought that there were</p>
<p>egregious offenses that were being</p>
<p>ignored and swept</p>
<p>under the rug that it</p>
<p>would actually be unpatriotic to not report them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very good question</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the question that was raised with the pentagon</p>
<p>papers it&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s tricky</p>
<p>right well sometimes</p>
<p>your government</p>
<p>is saying that we&rsquo;re not bombing cambodia and you</p>
<p>start finding out that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>exactly that</p>
<p>in violation of whatever it might be</p>
<p>you know this is a</p>
<p>whistleblower</p>
<p>is a whistleblower</p>
<p>it all depends a</p>
<p>whistleblower is always</p>
<p>gonna have to</p>
<p>take responsibility for the fact that there are people</p>
<p>in the government that he&rsquo;s the betrayed that are</p>
<p>gonna call him</p>
<p>a scumbag and try to prosecute him</p>
<p>i do think i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>very good question i do</p>
<p>think that sometimes you&rsquo;re in a position</p>
<p>where you are</p>
<p>privy to information that is either unjust illegal</p>
<p>but there are channels</p>
<p>there are also channels in our government to go through</p>
<p>sometimes you think to yourself the press</p>
<p>might be the last resort there are other legal channels</p>
<p>that the military provides</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good question man</p>
<p>i do think that you have a responsibility as a</p>
<p>human being when you see grave and justice</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think in this case that was the case i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think this private</p>
<p>saw anything</p>
<p>grossly injust in</p>
<p>fact do you think he&rsquo;s just he just was impulsive</p>
<p>like what do you why do you think he did it you know</p>
<p>what the fuck that&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s him let&rsquo;s ask him</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re drinking coconut</p>
<p>water ladies and gentlemen you ever had c2o coconut</p>
<p>water i love it</p>
<p>no what is that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really hard to find coconut water</p>
<p>i like that it&rsquo;s glute there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s amy and</p>
<p>bryant&rsquo;s to that can be found on</p>
<p>why is this hard to find</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s just really popular</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hundred percent natural new it&rsquo;s tonics</p>
<p>sorry about that ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>sorry we&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>middle of fascinating fucking conversation my goddamn</p>
<p>phone has to ring</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a really good question whenever you know</p>
<p>you know an institution of</p>
<p>power it&rsquo;s tricky</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know what is</p>
<p>this what is this nation</p>
<p>founded on the nation is founded on</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a very good question</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a very good question what is that if you</p>
<p>found it on</p>
<p>truth if we go back to 2003</p>
<p>and you had very very good information that there were</p>
<p>no weapons of mass destruction for example if you had</p>
<p>top secret information</p>
<p>that for example</p>
<p>we have no evidence whatsoever that</p>
<p>there are any weapons of mass destruction yet an entire</p>
<p>a nation is being sold a bill of goods</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s just take that as an example</p>
<p>and you knew</p>
<p>for sure because by the way in 2002 nobody had any idea</p>
<p>nobody was really saying even</p>
<p>on the national security council on the united nations</p>
<p>security council nobody was saying</p>
<p>stam hussein didn&rsquo;t have weapons in mass destruction</p>
<p>they were saying</p>
<p>where are they</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they were saying we</p>
<p>all assumed he had met in weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;d used them on the kurds in the 90s</p>
<p>okay poison gas not just poison gas but germ</p>
<p>warfare as well</p>
<p>so we had documented evidence and you</p>
<p>know and the united</p>
<p>states united nations corroborated this it wasn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>us intelligence</p>
<p>but we had documented</p>
<p>evidence that he had used and killed</p>
<p>a large number of</p>
<p>kurdish men</p>
<p>women and children with</p>
<p>these horrible weapons so in 2002</p>
<p>when you say when</p>
<p>bush was saying look</p>
<p>this guy has the fourth largest army in the world</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s acted very responsibly started</p>
<p>three wars two with iran one with kuwait</p>
<p>which resulted in a million</p>
<p>people the dead on both sides this guy miscalculates</p>
<p>all the time you tell me what&rsquo;s to stop him from</p>
<p>dropping a weapon of mass destruction</p>
<p>into an enemy</p>
<p>of ours hands</p>
<p>anonymously like arcade okay it was a very</p>
<p>that was a debate</p>
<p>that they talked</p>
<p>about in the war room</p>
<p>bush says you know what the</p>
<p>guys got weapons of mass destruction let&rsquo;s make a play</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bring it up in the</p>
<p>to the to the united nations and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to war if this guy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cough them up</p>
<p>now let me ask you something if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>what what is going on</p>
<p>just shut up</p>
<p>hold ladies hold</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i hope you&rsquo;re taking notes this</p>
<p>story cause i don&rsquo;t know what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about this story is haunted</p>
<p>dude do you</p>
<p>think coconut water is</p>
<p>gonna become so big that they&rsquo;re just gonna like</p>
<p>like coconuts are gonna become rare like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eat all the coconuts off the planet no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that popular what if it</p>
<p>because i mean is that something that we could run out</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what happened there</p>
<p>folks i have my volume turned off</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously a fucking</p>
<p>ghost in my there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ghost in the office ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>the government&rsquo;s letting me know</p>
<p>bitch i can turn up your volume anytime i want faggot</p>
<p>is the comedy store abortion</p>
<p>ghost it is but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the final</p>
<p>point here&rsquo;s the final point we&rsquo;ll move on</p>
<p>is if you if you were in a position and you</p>
<p>were a field operative you were a cia guy</p>
<p>you were in a pentagon whatever and you knew for a fact</p>
<p>that there were no weapons of mass destruction or at</p>
<p>least there was no evidence</p>
<p>but to devolve</p>
<p>that information</p>
<p>would be to compromise certain</p>
<p>national security secrets</p>
<p>would you do it</p>
<p>my feeling would be that you</p>
<p>should do it my</p>
<p>feeling would be that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stop a war from happening</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s no evidence</p>
<p>then maybe you</p>
<p>should say something</p>
<p>dude you&rsquo;re a fucking george clooney movie</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>smart you guys</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a goddamn george clooney</p>
<p>movie i don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>hair to be george clooney that fucking you can i did</p>
<p>give you some shit they put some</p>
<p>stuff in there you know what they dust my head</p>
<p>bruce willis</p>
<p>most important thing</p>
<p>bruce willis</p>
<p>shaved his head he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck yeah</p>
<p>i know dude you</p>
<p>could do it man this is the</p>
<p>movie this is the</p>
<p>breakout hit guys</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna stop it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stop the war</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy that talks too much he&rsquo;s an alternate</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;s an alternate</p>
<p>world an alternate version of our life</p>
<p>if you had stopped the war</p>
<p>if you had known</p>
<p>there was no weapons of mass destruction you get on tv</p>
<p>and you change</p>
<p>the world would they believe you and then it shows what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really like now in two thousand ten or eleven</p>
<p>eleven i get used to that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny is if you had all the answers you had all the</p>
<p>secrets and you how would</p>
<p>would people really listen to</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>idiot shut up</p>
<p>stupid right</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s what g they thought</p>
<p>about jesus man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they thought</p>
<p>about jesus</p>
<p>unless you can provide</p>
<p>produce miracles</p>
<p>right there and then even then they&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trick there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>about this looking back to a time when someone</p>
<p>had it all fucking nailed we&rsquo;ve always done it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true for the</p>
<p>past what is that it&rsquo;s called the good old days do you</p>
<p>think that that is because</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>bunch of different versions of</p>
<p>civilization that</p>
<p>things have</p>
<p>crashed and gotten terrible and then gotten better and</p>
<p>crashed and gotten terrible</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve always looked back</p>
<p>to when things were</p>
<p>great before it</p>
<p>crashed it&rsquo;s almost like an</p>
<p>ethic it&rsquo;s almost like the way we</p>
<p>think well you know like</p>
<p>they were talking about this</p>
<p>fundamentalist</p>
<p>islamic movement it&rsquo;s a very new</p>
<p>thing in islam</p>
<p>and this is extreme</p>
<p>extremes who believe that</p>
<p>they always look back when muhammad</p>
<p>created islam and that was the golden</p>
<p>age and it was</p>
<p>where everything was perfect and</p>
<p>stuff like that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i think that some</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think sometimes people will look</p>
<p>back started it what</p>
<p>started the the most</p>
<p>the most extreme movement now well</p>
<p>a lot of it came from what they</p>
<p>were a hobby sect of</p>
<p>islam which</p>
<p>was in saudi arabian continues to be in</p>
<p>saudi arabia</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a puritanical form of islam but</p>
<p>this is a long</p>
<p>debate i don&rsquo;t want to say</p>
<p>but i mean certainly i think</p>
<p>one of the one of the things that caused</p>
<p>islamic fundamentalism was</p>
<p>i think i think islamic</p>
<p>fundamentalism like anything else is an idea</p>
<p>that was that was born out of the a</p>
<p>bunch of men who basically</p>
<p>felt lost and</p>
<p>insignificant</p>
<p>and needed something to make themselves feel</p>
<p>i guess cohesive and important</p>
<p>you know whenever</p>
<p>you look back and this is what i was trying to say</p>
<p>about when you look back</p>
<p>usually when people look back on the good old days</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>reaction it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re connected to something that&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to revive something you&rsquo;re trying to revive something</p>
<p>and when you look back</p>
<p>whenever you talk</p>
<p>about well back in the day with</p>
<p>kong you hear this with martial arts a lot</p>
<p>back in the day</p>
<p>those kung fu masters</p>
<p>could walk on water</p>
<p>they could fly through the air</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s like kind of like before</p>
<p>things were contaminated</p>
<p>but when they</p>
<p>first came out they were pure</p>
<p>and throughout the ages they become</p>
<p>compromised and contaminated</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a human</p>
<p>thing we do instead of realizing that</p>
<p>things actually evolve and get better usually</p>
<p>we like to look at</p>
<p>when things</p>
<p>first came when they were first born</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a purity to it</p>
<p>and we got to</p>
<p>get back to that purity because we&rsquo;ve lost our way</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people look back on history and kind of say</p>
<p>boy back in the day</p>
<p>when the mailman came and the milkman came</p>
<p>and it was just so</p>
<p>great and you can walk the streets without anybody</p>
<p>killing you or murdering you and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all a lie</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all horseshit in my opinion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all like</p>
<p>looking back on the good old days when</p>
<p>you know things</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t so good</p>
<p>things were actually really</p>
<p>inconvenient and really difficult you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>the internet</p>
<p>and access to information immediately</p>
<p>sure it comes with its own problems but we live</p>
<p>for the most part</p>
<p>most of us even in the past 30 years live a</p>
<p>much better life and i&rsquo;ll give you two examples i mean</p>
<p>china and remember china was</p>
<p>and russia for that matter</p>
<p>and most of</p>
<p>those countries couldn&rsquo;t they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave their own country</p>
<p>those were communist</p>
<p>countries with very</p>
<p>strong central authorities that controlled</p>
<p>everything you did</p>
<p>latin america was all military</p>
<p>dictatorships now they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>democracies so i mean</p>
<p>you know when people look back</p>
<p>on the old days i&rsquo;m always like i don&rsquo;t know man you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>studying history too much because</p>
<p>yeah the old days can suck my dick correct</p>
<p>about that correct</p>
<p>even old car suck i remember</p>
<p>when i used</p>
<p>to whittle yeah an old car with a carburetor</p>
<p>that got like a</p>
<p>block of gallon</p>
<p>and always broke down</p>
<p>they look awesome</p>
<p>they drive stupid</p>
<p>right they just so</p>
<p>ridiculously dumb not to mention</p>
<p>they were really</p>
<p>really dangerous they didn&rsquo;t have airbags</p>
<p>i mean you went</p>
<p>through those</p>
<p>airbags man</p>
<p>you lost your head</p>
<p>those brakes were bunk son</p>
<p>forget it those</p>
<p>brakes barely stopped</p>
<p>those cars big</p>
<p>stupid drum</p>
<p>brakes on the back</p>
<p>we were just driving around in</p>
<p>death machines</p>
<p>right now we have abs</p>
<p>brakes we got computers we got</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s amazing that people survived</p>
<p>having those</p>
<p>stupid cars they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t most of the time you had kids riding in the</p>
<p>front seat with</p>
<p>those lap belts jesus</p>
<p>fucking hey put on</p>
<p>your lap belt everybody</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in the backseat i don&rsquo;t need my seatbelt</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re driving around this huge rectangle of metal</p>
<p>forget it barely</p>
<p>loosely connected to</p>
<p>stupid tires that are screeching around</p>
<p>every corner wait</p>
<p>there goes my</p>
<p>transmission shitty cars</p>
<p>they would take a turn</p>
<p>and you would hear</p>
<p>their tire squeal</p>
<p>yeah because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re barely hanging onto the road with this shitty</p>
<p>piece yeah and you</p>
<p>get in an accident all you got to run into is</p>
<p>steel and glass not</p>
<p>even not even like</p>
<p>not even that</p>
<p>crushed glass it&rsquo;s just like that big shards of</p>
<p>glass cars today</p>
<p>they defy physics</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t really but they feel like they do yeah</p>
<p>ralph nader you can</p>
<p>thank him for that he was the</p>
<p>spearhead for all that</p>
<p>stuff really</p>
<p>ralph nader that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>thanking that dude for shit</p>
<p>how about that</p>
<p>ralph nader was like cars are dangerous and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do something</p>
<p>about it he</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>got pissed off</p>
<p>by that guy when he was running for president</p>
<p>yeah that sort of revealed who he really is</p>
<p>well yeah because</p>
<p>he took away he took votes crucial votes away from you</p>
<p>know the democrats then</p>
<p>yeah there was</p>
<p>that idea and there was also the idea that well</p>
<p>who gives a fuck</p>
<p>about politics</p>
<p>so you think</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>so you think that</p>
<p>ralph nader is the one responsible for it all</p>
<p>well ralph nader is</p>
<p>ralph nader was the guy who said you know</p>
<p>these cars are i</p>
<p>think he started a</p>
<p>thing called unsafe at any</p>
<p>speed or something and</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what it was i</p>
<p>might be wrong but</p>
<p>ralph nader</p>
<p>basically said look we&rsquo;ve got a lot of people dying</p>
<p>needlessly and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous getting paralyzed and</p>
<p>stuff because cars are not safe they&rsquo;re dangerous</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a way we have the</p>
<p>technology to make cars safer</p>
<p>you know that mercedes benz</p>
<p>invented the airbag okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hold everybody so is brodie stevens</p>
<p>was he over there yes he was</p>
<p>yes he was ladies and gentlemen brodie stevens</p>
<p>going crazy over there brodie stevens</p>
<p>going crazy</p>
<p>did he bring his dog</p>
<p>uh he did not bring his dog</p>
<p>he did not bring his dog</p>
<p>but i was gonna say that i</p>
<p>wanna buy a mercedes next because i found out mercedes</p>
<p>invented the airbag</p>
<p>and gave it to every other car company</p>

<p>tough dude i always tell you about</p>
<p>i said he does everything he rides bulls and</p>
<p>stuff like that and i&rsquo;ve seen him i have</p>
<p>video of him riding a bull</p>
<p>he knocked both his</p>
<p>teeth out and he was like whatever</p>

<p>other guys don&rsquo;t everybody&rsquo;s like runs and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he gets up casually like</p>
<p>whatever like that</p>
<p>and i said to him once i go</p>

<p>he fucking break a wild</p>
<p>horse i got how</p>
<p>would you do that he goes i fucking</p>

<p>could that&rsquo;s how i do that</p>
<p>i was like you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>badass well how does that work</p>
<p>well the horse just gives up and becomes your best now</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>break really work yeah you</p>
<p>break a horse on a line</p>
<p>you have it</p>
<p>you teach you</p>
<p>that a run in a circle and you have it on a line and</p>
<p>stuff so if they get a wild</p>
<p>horse they really can</p>
<p>break a wild</p>
<p>horse someone can</p>
<p>you could lasso a wild mustang</p>
<p>yeah but there&rsquo;s a technique to it you have to you</p>
<p>know you don&rsquo;t get on it at</p>
<p>first you you</p>
<p>tether it you</p>
<p>tether it to</p>
<p>like a line and you and you and you</p>
<p>teach it how to run you know how does it not just</p>
<p>stomp the fuck</p>
<p>out of you it does a lot of times they will</p>
<p>but you gotta you have a whip</p>
<p>and you keep them in line i mean somebody</p>
<p>really knows what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you gotta whip it</p>
<p>the people still do that</p>
<p>in this day and</p>
<p>age you still try to tame wild</p>
<p>horses well you have to</p>
<p>break a horse</p>
<p>where is a wild</p>
<p>horse these days</p>
<p>where you find i</p>
<p>know i want to find</p>
<p>packs of wild horses and</p>
<p>hang out horses</p>
<p>horses are indigenous i believe originally</p>
<p>in the gobi desert of</p>
<p>nepal i mean</p>
<p>of mongolia</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>horses came</p>
<p>from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the wild</p>
<p>asses came from</p>
<p>and all that so i believe that the original</p>
<p>the original</p>
<p>horse that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they were originally</p>
<p>from the steps of asia</p>
<p>so do they come</p>
<p>over here on boats they came over here they</p>
<p>think when the</p>
<p>i need to know whether</p>
<p>the bearing straight</p>
<p>or in fact in fact</p>
<p>the native americans didn&rsquo;t ride</p>
<p>horses right</p>
<p>i understand it</p>
<p>first right</p>
<p>those were brought over by</p>
<p>spaniards by the spaniards</p>
<p>yeah and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how the</p>
<p>whole deal with the incas</p>
<p>the incas thought</p>
<p>they were gods because they were riding horses</p>
<p>right they thought</p>
<p>they were like this pretty</p>
<p>amazing gods</p>
<p>like they had</p>
<p>no idea what the fuck was that can you imagine you</p>
<p>see somebody riding a huge</p>
<p>horse an animal you&rsquo;d</p>

<p>out that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>elephants that&rsquo;s like elephants elephants kill</p>
<p>their handlers</p>
<p>their mahoots</p>
<p>all the time elephants</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting when you like</p>
<p>cause when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>when you talk</p>
<p>about breaking an animal</p>
<p>they have to</p>
<p>break an elephant and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awful they tie a</p>
<p>small elephant to like</p>
<p>stakes and they</p>
<p>basically beat it</p>
<p>i saw this thing this documentary they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>break an elephant&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spirit problem is</p>
<p>that now you&rsquo;re riding your elephant and the mahoots in</p>
<p>india it&rsquo;s like kind of a religious</p>
<p>thing i think in thailand</p>
<p>they will bathe it</p>
<p>they live with it they</p>
<p>spend all the time they feed it they bathe it they</p>
<p>clean it and they get very attached to</p>
<p>their elephants</p>
<p>that an elephant one day just decides you know what</p>
<p>this is ridiculous</p>
<p>you are a parasite on my back</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>feel like doing what you&rsquo;re doing so i&rsquo;m gonna have</p>
<p>and they rage</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go off into a rage and when they get</p>
<p>their handler</p>
<p>they a lot of times will just keep</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll stomp them till he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jelly and pull them</p>
<p>apart with their tusk</p>
<p>they pull the arms off and shit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not doing a goddamn</p>
<p>thing until he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>making mincemeat</p>
<p>for real out of you</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>no chimps no fucking elephants that&rsquo;s the theme of this</p>
<p>wildcat to animals</p>
<p>elephants dogs and</p>
<p>cats target</p>
<p>humans in some parts of the</p>
<p>world too that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>loved ones to</p>
<p>poachers they come through they come through villages</p>
<p>yeah if they&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>loved ones to poachers</p>
<p>they develop an attitude and they develop a hatred for</p>
<p>humans and they go and attack and</p>
<p>smash people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>houses just</p>
<p>smash their</p>
<p>houses and pull them out they&rsquo;re so big and</p>
<p>so powerful</p>
<p>doing a thing your</p>
<p>house is nothing they just walk</p>
<p>right through your</p>
<p>house i mean they</p>
<p>literally just kick down your front door</p>
<p>pull people out stab them to</p>
<p>death it&rsquo;s crazy they don&rsquo;t give a fuck no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an elephant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so strange</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about africa</p>
<p>and the quantity</p>
<p>of gigantic</p>
<p>things that can kill you there</p>
<p>india too you know back in the day a lot of people</p>
<p>tigers tigers cobras</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>die that way in the rural areas it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>when you look at africa i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why you know</p>
<p>african culture</p>
<p>if you look at</p>
<p>the rest of the</p>
<p>world all the inventions that have come out all</p>
<p>these different places</p>
<p>the most dangerous country is africa and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>place with the</p>
<p>least amount of inventions it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re living in africa you&rsquo;re actually growing</p>
<p>up and developing in africa you got fucked man you got</p>
<p>dropped off in some place</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>in an area that&rsquo;s filled with monsters</p>
<p>yeah but aren&rsquo;t they more advanced than</p>
<p>other monsters like</p>
<p>woodworkings</p>
<p>woodworking</p>
<p>and stuff like that</p>
<p>maybe well yeah i</p>
<p>mean living</p>
<p>their lives i mean</p>
<p>there was an awesome documentary on the congo</p>
<p>and these talked</p>
<p>about these fishermen that</p>
<p>literally from the time that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young they hang off trees</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a raging</p>
<p>river underneath them they&rsquo;ve developed this</p>
<p>intricate system of</p>
<p>nets that they create themselves</p>
<p>they make their own rope</p>
<p>using twine from trees and shit like that and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hanging from</p>
<p>these fucking trees over this raging river</p>
<p>and it looks like if they fall in they&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>at the very</p>
<p>least you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>smashed you may very well</p>
<p>drown i mean</p>
<p>this is like some serious rapids</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scooping fish</p>
<p>up as they do it and they&rsquo;re handing the nets up</p>
<p>really fucking complex</p>
<p>and if you look at it and say well you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very sophisticated for living in this environment</p>
<p>because if it</p>
<p>was me in that environment how the fuck am i</p>
<p>gonna get a fish</p>
<p>of this raging</p>
<p>crazy sea i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna figure that shit out my buddy</p>
<p>lived at the maasai in africa and he told me that</p>
<p>these dudes can tell you the difference between like a</p>
<p>blade of grass</p>
<p>and what it means and</p>
<p>what kind of animal pass through and why that animal</p>
<p>chose that plate of</p>
<p>grass to eat</p>
<p>i mean he said</p>
<p>they have an encyclopedic knowledge</p>
<p>of their environment</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like anything else</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>adapt and they use</p>
<p>their minds for what is relevant</p>
<p>to their survival and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re flourishing they&rsquo;re appropriate it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trippy thing</p>
<p>these tribal guys that hire</p>
<p>well americans rather hire them to go on hunts</p>
<p>and they take them to africa like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain big game hunters</p>
<p>that want one of everything</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like oh last time i got a zebra</p>
<p>right you know like they&rsquo;re shooting zebras</p>
<p>understood that i never understood that</p>
<p>trophy hunting it&rsquo;s so strange to me very</p>
<p>weird yeah i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t on one</p>
<p>hand you know</p>
<p>it can be argued that hunting actually pays to</p>
<p>like when you pay for a hunting tag</p>
<p>it pays to keep</p>
<p>everything healthy</p>
<p>because because it manages</p>
<p>the environment if you put</p>
<p>if you put if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a profit</p>
<p>in your environment so if you&rsquo;re making money</p>
<p>off of hunting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in everybody&rsquo;s interest to preserve that</p>
<p>did you don&rsquo;t want to kill the</p>
<p>goose with the golden egg</p>
<p>right you want to keep the goose</p>
<p>alive it goes towards</p>
<p>money goes towards</p>
<p>management and conservation that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>tricky thing</p>
<p>when it comes to hunting even in america like i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked to so many people</p>
<p>about hunting and they have this</p>
<p>crazy fucking</p>
<p>like almost you know disney</p>
<p>movie view of what</p>
<p>what eating meat is and what</p>
<p>meat where meat comes from</p>
<p>like man you don&rsquo;t want to do that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take some deer&rsquo;s life you want to do that like</p>
<p>do you understand you&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>leather shoes but</p>
<p>first of all do you not</p>
<p>understand that you have to</p>
<p>do you understand that</p>
<p>unless you want</p>
<p>a nation filled with mountain lions</p>
<p>you have to kill the deer</p>
<p>okay cause otherwise you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have no predators and then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be sick</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna starve to</p>
<p>death everywhere</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be hitting them with cars they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die miserable horrible vicious</p>
<p>deaths you gotta call her</p>
<p>yeah you have to because</p>
<p>otherwise they&rsquo;ll just i mean it&rsquo;s a natural balance</p>
<p>and the way we&rsquo;ve set up</p>
<p>civilization we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>allowing any predators around us you know</p>
<p>which is a pretty</p>
<p>smart thing right</p>
<p>so because of that you know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not if you don&rsquo;t have predators and you have all</p>
<p>these deer you have to fucking</p>
<p>shoot some of them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to manage it</p>
<p>people they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to mention though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s delicious</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s delicious</p>
<p>the crazy idea that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not supposed to do that is it&rsquo;s such a strange argument</p>
<p>you know are</p>
<p>these fucking deer</p>
<p>gonna live forever and cure cancer</p>
<p>like what are you talking</p>
<p>about stupid</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna die eventually anyway</p>
<p>by the way let&rsquo;s be honest deer</p>
<p>are food i mean</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re food</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re beautiful yes they are</p>
<p>definitely beautiful i&rsquo;m not saying eat all of them</p>
<p>but you should</p>
<p>shoot a few every year</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason they&rsquo;re animals</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re animals of flight because predators like them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re delicious</p>
<p>would you punch a deer if it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t attack you back</p>
<p>dude these are dangerous</p>
<p>deers fuck humans</p>
<p>never gonna</p>
<p>attack you back with you</p>
<p>why would i do that i know</p>
<p>why would i want to hit it i pet it</p>
<p>you would pet if you had a pet deer that</p>
<p>would get you laid</p>
<p>hey you guys girls want to pet my deer</p>
<p>every single girl on the way</p>
<p>oh my god that&rsquo;s the cutest</p>
<p>deer that is</p>
<p>supposed to be</p>

<p>diego zoo and i was</p>
<p>watching the mountain gorillas wrestle</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the best wrestlers</p>
<p>on the planet</p>
<p>so strong but they&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>wrestlers they that they grow up</p>
<p>wrestling the the babies</p>
<p>all they do is</p>

<p>great bambi</p>
<p>rolls i mean</p>
<p>guillotines it&rsquo;s amazing bro it&rsquo;s incredible wow</p>
<p>i was literally</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you i&rsquo;m not kidding when i say like</p>
<p>ankle picks</p>
<p>crazy shit veins ducks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at the san</p>
<p>diego zoo go there</p>
<p>and you can go right up</p>
<p>to the glass</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the silverback</p>
<p>who just sits with his back to everybody</p>
<p>and you just look at this 600</p>
<p>pounds six foot one gorilla 6'1 600</p>
<p>pounds no fat</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen no fat on it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s 600 pounds 6'1</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s two a brock</p>
<p>lesnar&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>i would love to</p>
<p>watch and the all he eats is broccoli</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all he eats is fucking</p>
<p>grass and yeah</p>
<p>grass and bamboo sheets i eat</p>
<p>greens isn&rsquo;t that incredible</p>
<p>yeah that big and that strong</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s mostly to keep everybody the fuck away yeah</p>
<p>just stop let me fucking eat</p>
<p>oh just let me sit here</p>
<p>and have some fucking vegetables they were</p>
<p>trying to figure out how</p>
<p>strong a mountain</p>
<p>gorilla is and they couldn&rsquo;t figure it out</p>
<p>but there was this log that took like</p>
<p>seven men to move because it was part of the exhibit</p>
<p>the mountain</p>
<p>gorilla had a little tantrum and flung the log</p>
<p>it flung it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>throw it but flung it you know when</p>
<p>you fling something it means it&rsquo;s really light like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fling that</p>
<p>bottle at me</p>
<p>it really is a trip that they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>strong and all they do is eat vegetables</p>
<p>like what happened to the gorilla</p>
<p>that made it not want to just pick some animal up and</p>
<p>start eating it one day i don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>right because they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>total herbivores you know</p>
<p>yeah pretty much</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they eat any meat</p>
<p>whatsoever chimps chimps eat a lot of meat</p>
<p>a lot of meat</p>
<p>yeah champs organized hunting parties yeah i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before on the show you and i have</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure if we have because it&rsquo;s a subject we</p>
<p>discuss i never get</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s what this</p>
<p>chick was doing just like come on it</p>

<p>no it was just trying to confuse you</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t realize that you&rsquo;re not eating meat</p>
<p>so that you</p>
<p>would get stuffed</p>
<p>and then you get this how do</p>

<p>really yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to brazil i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m there</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying that now i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about that yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the card has been put in place yet</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite a ways away you know it&rsquo;s an august</p>
<p>i have to figure out who they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna believe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s locked in</p>
<p>coffee better in brazil</p>
<p>coffee yeah brazil&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really known for</p>
<p>their coffee no</p>
<p>no i think it&rsquo;s colombia colombia</p>
<p>hawaii hawaii is the best coffee</p>
<p>brazilians own hot women right</p>
<p>with big asses</p>
<p>yes and toxoplasma that&rsquo;s the place where</p>
<p>people are infected by that cat oh</p>
<p>66 of the people what</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know about this oh my brother</p>
<p>we talked about it yesterday unfortunately but i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>bring it up again cause you&rsquo;re gonna freak the fuck out</p>
<p>there is a there is a parasite called toxoplasma</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a cat parasite</p>
<p>and it affects rats and</p>
<p>what it does to rats is it gets the rats and rewires</p>
<p>their sexual system</p>
<p>and has them attracted to the</p>
<p>smell of cat piss</p>
<p>so these rats</p>
<p>start going</p>
<p>where cat piss is</p>
<p>and like literally testy</p>
<p>swell the whole meal</p>
<p>the cats eat them</p>
<p>and now the cat has this parasite</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how it</p>
<p>travels from cat to rat</p>
<p>and it gets to</p>
<p>humans and it gets to</p>
<p>humans if they</p>
<p>touch cat shit or if they touch it</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s in the field</p>
<p>and when it gets in your</p>
<p>system it does two</p>
<p>things for women</p>
<p>it makes them more sexually</p>
<p>promiscuous</p>
<p>and it makes them more submissive</p>
<p>and for men it makes them more arrogant assholes</p>
<p>and they even have</p>
<p>correlated it to</p>
<p>successful soccer teams</p>
<p>when you look at</p>
<p>countries because it makes you so</p>
<p>aggressive and so reckless</p>
<p>and you look at</p>
<p>countries that are</p>
<p>successful in</p>
<p>the world cup also</p>
<p>have very high rates of toxoplasma in their</p>
<p>population i need to get some time</p>
<p>i want to no you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want because it slows your reaction time</p>
<p>out i can get to it</p>
<p>there was a doctor on</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a youtube</p>
<p>video i really forget the guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>go over it again but it was a guy who was a</p>
<p>toxic plasma researcher</p>
<p>who used to work in an emergency room</p>
<p>and he found</p>
<p>that when they tested people food were</p>
<p>motorcycle accidents</p>
<p>disproportionate</p>
<p>amount of them were toxoplasma infected wow</p>
<p>and it made them reckless</p>
<p>it makes you reckless and it may even slow</p>
<p>your reaction time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s really strange but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a you know it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>brain altering</p>
<p>parasite that&rsquo;s affected 50 million americans</p>
<p>i just want to see what in 30 years</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve really kind of got a lot of this biochemic</p>
<p>chemistry down and how our</p>
<p>bodies react and</p>
<p>what kind of pills they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to come up with well</p>
<p>are they going to be able to eradicate something</p>
<p>this you figure out a way to send nanobots</p>
<p>in there to kill all the questions yeah most likely</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>would they do how</p>
<p>would you kill something that becomes a</p>
<p>brain parasite no</p>
<p>i whenever people ask</p>
<p>these questions you know i just</p>
<p>think to myself people say well you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come up with different</p>
<p>things but the</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be plain old</p>
<p>death and there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be these issues and new</p>
<p>diseases and new mutations and stuff</p>
<p>the body&rsquo;s time is finite</p>
<p>you just have to accept that i mean</p>
<p>make use of it what you can and keep it as healthy</p>
<p>as possible but you must accept that it&rsquo;s finite</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m always working out though my</p>
<p>buddy who&rsquo;s a writer and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do a lot of</p>
<p>stuff he&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>kind of intellectual guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always looking at me and i&rsquo;m working</p>
<p>out and i&rsquo;m doing my dead list and i&rsquo;m doing all this</p>
<p>stuff and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like look at the little man trying to stop the clock</p>
<p>trying to slow the</p>
<p>clock down ryan</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true but you know what man</p>
<p>it does one</p>
<p>thing for me for sure</p>
<p>it makes me</p>
<p>like it blows stress out</p>
<p>and makes me see the</p>
<p>world it makes me feel</p>
<p>better i love</p>
<p>i think exercise i know everybody</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s a vanity</p>
<p>thing and a lot of it is vanity</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of guys what</p>
<p>you know you want to look good you want to look better</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be sexually</p>
<p>sexually discussed</p>
<p>i also talk</p>
<p>about like in</p>
<p>this part of my</p>
<p>stand up now i&rsquo;m just talking</p>
<p>about how i really also think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s genetic it&rsquo;s also like you wanna</p>
<p>do a couple</p>
<p>things one you</p>
<p>wanna look like you</p>
<p>gotta guys bench</p>
<p>press there&rsquo;s no reason to really</p>
<p>bench press is not kind of a useless exercise you</p>
<p>never really do the</p>
<p>bench press good</p>
<p>for hip escapes</p>
<p>yeah yeah it is but i&rsquo;m just saying that</p>
<p>usually you&rsquo;re not in a situation</p>
<p>where you have to hip escape</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve got a hip escape at</p>
<p>least three days a week</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>breeding instinct we want to</p>
<p>fluff our feathers so girls</p>
<p>see that we&rsquo;ve got that</p>
<p>going we want to look like we can</p>
<p>fight the tiger man</p>
<p>we want to look like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why guys fucking you know you got to look like you</p>
<p>yeah the bench is not really that important</p>
<p>no but it fluffs</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like your peacock</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like birds man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny when you see some dudes that are like</p>
<p>completely disproportionate</p>
<p>like these weird</p>
<p>bodies with chick</p>
<p>strippers like a big</p>
<p>chest i read it in muscle</p>
<p>and fitness bro</p>
<p>there was this one dude at the gym</p>
<p>had this giant chest and</p>
<p>giant arms okay</p>
<p>and then he used to wear</p>
<p>sweatpants okay you</p>
<p>never saw his legs but there&rsquo;s no way they</p>
<p>could match his</p>
<p>upper body his</p>
<p>upper body was massive</p>
<p>and his neck</p>
<p>was like a small man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>arm that&rsquo;s a terrible thing</p>
<p>man you always</p>
<p>gotta look at the neck</p>
<p>you gotta look at the neck and the legs actually</p>
<p>first crazy wobbly</p>
<p>neck i was like this is the</p>
<p>weirdest combination of</p>
<p>like this guy</p>
<p>just decided to just</p>
<p>every day do the same goddamn exercises yeah</p>
<p>flies just packed that blew up his upper body</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s probably a complete</p>
<p>disconnect between all three</p>
<p>systems i bet his body works terrible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably so confused as to why it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>heavy on top</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when you roll with a guy like that</p>
<p>a lot of times he&rsquo;s a bodybuilder and he feels like</p>
<p>you can move</p>
<p>him so well and then you get some dude who just has</p>
<p>got kind of a</p>
<p>thick neck and kind of like a big base and just</p>
<p>big legs and also</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a tank you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t even move you well</p>
<p>what a lot of people do that are like bodybuilder</p>
<p>type strength guys they ignore the legs and the back</p>
<p>those are the most important</p>
<p>things for your movement absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely your legs and all the way up through your</p>
<p>upper back you know your core like your ability to stay</p>
<p>and keep your own position and the ability to resist</p>
<p>you know being pushed around</p>
<p>and your ability</p>
<p>to push off your legs that&rsquo;s the most important thing</p>
<p>so when guys are always like doing</p>
<p>bench presses</p>
<p>and shit like you&rsquo;re concentrating on the dumbest shit</p>
<p>concentrating on most of the</p>
<p>least important shit yeah i was</p>
<p>gonna ask you</p>
<p>obviously i&rsquo;m a huge</p>
<p>ufc fan and you talk</p>
<p>about this a lot so i don&rsquo;t want to talk</p>
<p>about it too much but</p>
<p>one thing i always notice</p>
<p>when i watch it with a lot of my friends we always talk</p>
<p>about how detailed your knowledge is about</p>
<p>the fight game</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve always been a</p>
<p>fighter and you boxed</p>
<p>and you did a lot of taekwondo and you did and you</p>
<p>wrestled and</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and you continue to</p>
<p>but how much has</p>
<p>your understanding of</p>
<p>fighting evolved do you think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evolved a lot or have you always kind of had it</p>
<p>yeah well you just</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>fights it into it evolves</p>
<p>because you see more</p>
<p>things you know you see more</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>watch ufc i always</p>
<p>watch like k one</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m a big fan of k one kickboxing and muay thai</p>
<p>and i like watching but don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just jelly</p>
<p>brian and the jelly</p>
<p>the jelly the</p>
<p>jelly is good too</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>hate one jelly</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about but don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s but</p>
<p>are you surprised that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching really</p>
<p>great wrestlers like maynard and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name</p>
<p>frank actor yeah</p>
<p>watching to</p>
<p>top flight college</p>
<p>collegiate wrestlers</p>
<p>box now it&rsquo;s like becoming</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s becoming</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to see why boxing even came</p>
<p>about it kind of like</p>
<p>evolved into boxing</p>
<p>ultimately you know</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so i think what it is with</p>
<p>those two guys is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re both really good</p>
<p>wrestlers and it&rsquo;s really hard to take each</p>
<p>other down so it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>and they want to</p>
<p>stand and bang because you know it</p>
<p>starts to become</p>
<p>like you know a</p>
<p>thing you know like</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna meet me</p>
<p>in the center of the octagon and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna sling leather</p>
<p>right you know and right</p>
<p>you know hey if he wants to</p>
<p>stand with me you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of that so</p>
<p>guys want to</p>
<p>knock guys out it&rsquo;s the best feeling in the</p>
<p>world i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>and guys want to</p>
<p>submit guys too</p>
<p>and i think both guys are really difficult to take down</p>
<p>and so when you&rsquo;re really difficult to take each</p>
<p>other down it&rsquo;s like what are we</p>
<p>gonna do we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>take each other down and nobody</p>
<p>really wants</p>
<p>to go to the</p>
<p>ground anyway it&rsquo;s exhausting you&rsquo;d rather</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i mean well the</p>
<p>quickest way to win i mean if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>catch a submission obviously is win by</p>
<p>knockout and ray maynard has some</p>
<p>heavy heavy hands as you saw in that fight</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen anybody hit so many times in the</p>
<p>first round get hurt so many times</p>
<p>and come back and win the next</p>
<p>round it was incredible incredible he dude</p>
<p>ray maynard is a</p>
<p>beast man he rocked him with a left hook and then just</p>
<p>started like</p>
<p>beating on a man i mean it was</p>
<p>anybody else you</p>
<p>seen him as high as one ninety he gets big he gets big</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>thick kid he&rsquo;s very very muscular i know he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>those lats that go all the way down</p>
<p>his hips he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that like when he cuts weight he really you</p>
<p>know he has to diet for a long time</p>
<p>he has to know in advance when he&rsquo;s fighting</p>
<p>he has to diet get his body fat</p>
<p>real low and then</p>
<p>slowly dehydrate himself it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like they have it down to a science so when he gets in</p>
<p>the octagon he&rsquo;s not 155 he&rsquo;s probably 165 170</p>
<p>somewhere around that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s big he&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>heavy so super</p>
<p>strong you know and</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>frankie edgar</p>
<p>fucking take</p>
<p>those shots man it was crazy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just incredible he just kept</p>
<p>going man he</p>
<p>would not quit</p>
<p>it was several opportunities for him to quit</p>
<p>where he was just</p>
<p>getting bombed on that if he wanted to give it up he</p>
<p>could have just</p>
<p>given it up</p>
<p>he never for a minute</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be very</p>
<p>interested to see</p>
<p>it very interesting to see how he or manor did</p>
<p>against jose aldo</p>
<p>yeah you talking to me baby</p>
<p>well apparently they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna rematch</p>
<p>which i think</p>
<p>these guys gonna rematch</p>
<p>which i think is</p>
<p>gonna be fantastic</p>
<p>know i think when you got a</p>
<p>fight that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>close god it was so close</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many arguments like you know what was the</p>
<p>first round was it a 10 8</p>
<p>round was it</p>
<p>some guys have said it</p>
<p>could have been a 10 7</p>
<p>you know obviously i&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>judge i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>score the fights that way but i think</p>
<p>you know if</p>
<p>i looked at it you know you looked at it like as far as</p>
<p>rounds one and you know fuck it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>close it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>close the big</p>
<p>thing is the</p>
<p>first round how much damage did you give</p>
<p>maynard in the</p>
<p>first round because a lot of the other</p>
<p>rounds are like</p>
<p>man there&rsquo;s a few of them that were really close</p>
<p>just incredible that</p>
<p>edgar could come back like that it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your call on the maynard adjusted really well too</p>
<p>cause he almost</p>
<p>punched himself out in the</p>
<p>first round and</p>
<p>second round</p>
<p>he was having a hard time</p>
<p>then the third</p>
<p>round he got</p>
<p>loose again</p>
<p>so he came right back so you know you</p>
<p>say it wrestling and you&rsquo;ve been wrestling</p>
<p>since you were that</p>
<p>young and you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>learning how to suck weight and you have to</p>
<p>train that hard</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so mentally tough</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re the most</p>
<p>mentally tough</p>
<p>i went to i went</p>
<p>to dan gables intensive</p>
<p>wrestling camp when i was in high</p>
<p>school and they</p>
<p>trained us so</p>
<p>bad so hard i that&rsquo;s when i decided i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>wrestling in college</p>
<p>this is a nightmare i&rsquo;m not doing this</p>
<p>dan gables got famous</p>
<p>for that well you know dan gable also has like two</p>
<p>hips and two</p>
<p>fake knees yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy he really</p>
<p>literally wore his body down to the bone</p>
<p>well he does that with his wrestlers</p>
<p>apparently he it&rsquo;s a mental</p>
<p>thing like he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll just wear you down</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where but you know the the real interesting argument</p>
<p>about that is the eastern</p>
<p>europeans they they don&rsquo;t do it there&rsquo;s like a bunch of</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>i swear to god i just it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other phone</p>
<p>i have two phones in my office</p>
<p>holy shit that&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re a billionaire</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re a kid and your mom told you to</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t crack your</p>
<p>knuckles because</p>
<p>it makes your</p>
<p>fist bigger</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>do you remember</p>
<p>when you were a kid and your mom told you not to</p>
<p>crack your knuckles</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;ll make your</p>
<p>knuckles bigger did you ever hear that as great</p>
<p>i always thought like oh yeah i</p>
<p>might crack my</p>
<p>knuckles so i have a bigger fist i could</p>
<p>punch people better</p>
<p>i think i just started</p>
<p>cracking all my</p>
<p>knuckles to</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s how i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>building my body&rsquo;s muscle up and i forgot that that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really work like</p>
<p>no man i&rsquo;m just glad i&rsquo;m not up</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>fight for a living that&rsquo;s a hard life i respect</p>
<p>those guys last of our</p>
<p>phone problems i</p>
<p>swear to god</p>
<p>i disconnected both of them</p>
<p>you get rid of your home</p>
<p>phones who uses home</p>
<p>phone what&rsquo;s your call</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your call on up here there&rsquo;s no cellular service</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your call on the</p>
<p>silver velvet or</p>
<p>and anderson</p>
<p>is an interesting</p>
<p>fight you know vitor is</p>
<p>a really dangerous guy</p>
<p>like as far as like box</p>
<p>like his yeah</p>
<p>his hands he&rsquo;s really dangerous yeah so fast</p>
<p>you saw a rich</p>
<p>franklin fight</p>
<p>how quick he took out</p>
<p>franklin&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>if he unloads</p>
<p>on you like that and catches you he comes with a</p>
<p>swarm of punches man i know</p>
<p>the only problem the v tours had is in the past</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had a harder time in like the</p>
<p>second and third</p>
<p>rounds maintaining the same intensity but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had some mental issues but he had like</p>
<p>a really a lot of like real serious personal issues</p>
<p>like his sister was kidnapped and murdered terrible</p>
<p>yeah a lot of hard</p>
<p>stuff happened the worst</p>
<p>thing to ever go through</p>
<p>yeah and then</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>sweet person and</p>
<p>you know you have to make a living so you have to</p>
<p>fight so you&rsquo;re forced to take</p>
<p>fights when you&rsquo;re not in a good state</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not making any excuses for the guy but</p>
<p>traditionally</p>
<p>if you watch his</p>
<p>fights he&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>strong in the beginning of the</p>
<p>fight the issues that he has is in</p>
<p>second and third</p>
<p>rounds so at</p>
<p>185 the idea is that he killed</p>
<p>those issues because it was before</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>carrying around too much muscle</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s much leaner at 185</p>
<p>which is his natural weight isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a bit bigger than that in real life you know</p>
<p>probably closer to 200</p>
<p>pounds but you know when he&rsquo;s in lean</p>
<p>shape like ready for a</p>
<p>fight yeah he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>ridiculously athletic he always was</p>
<p>super fast like</p>
<p>his reflexes are</p>
<p>incredible right now</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s very good yeah</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>like yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>had some issues in the past like alstar over</p>
<p>him submitted</p>
<p>him but you</p>
<p>know the reality is a lot of that was probably fatigued</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re tired man you</p>
<p>leave your neck out there and a guy like</p>
<p>alstar jumps on it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting an mma</p>
<p>fight you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>adequately physically prepared it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do some stupid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s why to me mma is</p>
<p>is the greatest</p>
<p>sport because it requires</p>
<p>everything it requires like</p>
<p>literally not</p>
<p>just your courage and you have to be in top physical</p>
<p>shape but you know anything can happen the margin for</p>
<p>error is so slim</p>
<p>you make one mistake you get</p>
<p>tired and even the</p>
<p>training you have to go through</p>
<p>to become a really good boxer to become a really good</p>
<p>wrestler to become</p>
<p>and to stay in really good shape</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a full time</p>
<p>job all the time yeah and what happens is you mean</p>
<p>you have to decide</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>dedicate your time is it</p>
<p>gonna be to strengthen conditioning</p>
<p>is it gonna be to work in your</p>
<p>skills cause you only have a certain amount of</p>
<p>hours in a day</p>
<p>a certain amount of resources</p>
<p>in your physical body</p>
<p>exactly you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna burn yourself out to the</p>
<p>point where you can&rsquo;t recover</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>money in it i mean</p>
<p>the other thing is</p>
<p>just in the</p>
<p>beginning of his job man well</p>
<p>at the high</p>
<p>levels there is though</p>
<p>at the high</p>
<p>levels there&rsquo;s rockstar money</p>
<p>like george</p>
<p>st pierre is balling</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>ridiculous crazy</p>
<p>money like brock</p>
<p>lesnar made</p>
<p>ridiculous money</p>
<p>anybody who can sell tickets</p>
<p>chuck lindell</p>
<p>ridiculous money</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the guys who can sell</p>
<p>pay per views</p>
<p>the guys who can</p>
<p>get a piece of the action</p>
<p>guys who are</p>
<p>legit stars what the</p>
<p>ufc&rsquo;s done that&rsquo;s so smart</p>
<p>that a lot of people are</p>
<p>upset about is they&rsquo;ve made the name</p>
<p>ufc bigger than any fire that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>smartest thing that daemite&rsquo;s ever done</p>
<p>yeah the whole</p>
<p>thing is the</p>
<p>brand name is bigger than any fire</p>
<p>and the good thing</p>
<p>about that is everyone in the organization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in there they can get them to</p>
<p>fight each other</p>
<p>and when you have</p>
<p>outside there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>promotions the argument for that</p>
<p>against that rather is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with</p>
<p>floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao</p>
<p>they just won&rsquo;t fucking fight each</p>
<p>other it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>floyd mayweather just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>fight him he</p>
<p>just keeps putting it off</p>
<p>you know i want drug testing</p>
<p>i want to take his</p>
<p>blood 10 minutes</p>
<p>before the fight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fucking</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re convinced many packets</p>
<p>on steroids</p>
<p>but then you look at his last</p>
<p>fight he was 20 fucking</p>
<p>pounds lighter</p>
<p>so crazy that margarita</p>
<p>dude margarita</p>
<p>is lighter than</p>
<p>margarita margarita</p>
<p>is an animal</p>
<p>and he knew</p>
<p>just a big comeback</p>
<p>fight for him</p>
<p>and walks around at</p>
<p>175 yeah he&rsquo;s a big dude and has</p>
<p>never actually been</p>
<p>heard i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think margarita</p>
<p>not like that and</p>
<p>pacquiao just</p>
<p>he figures your game out and</p>
<p>sugar shame mostly</p>
<p>by the way stopped him so i shouldn&rsquo;t say he has</p>
<p>never been hurt that&rsquo;s not true i forgot</p>
<p>about that fight</p>
<p>that was the fight</p>
<p>where i can&rsquo;t believe i forgot</p>
<p>about that fight</p>
<p>because that was a fight</p>
<p>where he got exposed for</p>
<p>having plaster in his</p>
<p>gloves no that</p>
<p>was actually the coda</p>
<p>fight no no</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s sugar</p>
<p>shame mostly really</p>
<p>yes absolutely</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he came out</p>
<p>like almost jejected and humiliated and was suspended</p>
<p>and sugar sham mosley beat the fucking shit out of that</p>
<p>fight and that was a</p>
<p>fight where</p>
<p>a lot of people were saying well one of the reasons</p>
<p>why i bet he got his ass kicked he probably felt</p>
<p>super guilty</p>
<p>they got caught with his hand in the cookie jar</p>
<p>that he had been doing that to people</p>
<p>for a long time a lot of people suspected</p>
<p>sure he like</p>
<p>broke up code oh he</p>
<p>broke up a lot of guys yeah</p>
<p>it really that&rsquo;s really dangerous man i mean</p>
<p>frankly to be honest with you i</p>
<p>would have banned</p>
<p>him for life for that yeah</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous</p>
<p>that he only got a year banned</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s outrageous if they could</p>
<p>prove that he had done it more</p>
<p>even just proving that he did it once i also</p>
<p>think i also personally</p>
<p>think anybody does that and lets</p>
<p>their trainer</p>
<p>do that i think the</p>
<p>whole campus scumbag yeah</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s just a scumbag that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some creepy shit</p>
<p>shitting plaster in</p>
<p>2010 you&rsquo;re putting plaster in your rafts the worst</p>
<p>wow you know</p>
<p>but meanwhile</p>
<p>what i said mackie manny pacquiao 20</p>
<p>pounds fucking lighter</p>
<p>lights him up</p>
<p>like a christmas tree but he&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s come</p>
<p>close to this guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>greatest fighter ever</p>
<p>i really think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest boxer ever he&rsquo;s one in</p>
<p>eight different weight divisions i mean how do you</p>
<p>argue against that right</p>
<p>i mean if you see what he does to</p>
<p>all these different</p>
<p>fires oh by</p>
<p>the way he&rsquo;s a politician too</p>
<p>oh and by the way when he</p>
<p>fights all of his country all of the philippines</p>
<p>stops to watch</p>
<p>crime goes down</p>
<p>no pressure manny</p>
<p>and he goes in there like hey hey what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>up everybody hi how are you he&rsquo;s waving dudes in the</p>
<p>stands before they even</p>
<p>tried to hype up this</p>
<p>fight by talking</p>
<p>about you know how his</p>
<p>training camp hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>going so good like you</p>
<p>watch the hbo 24 7</p>
<p>man he&rsquo;s so distracted man he&rsquo;s so distracted</p>
<p>meanwhile he gets in there</p>
<p>i got this thing</p>
<p>that dude is just</p>
<p>watching fireworks grow off</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s standing in front of that little fucking little</p>
<p>lightning bolts flying left and right</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s seeing those</p>
<p>sparks in front of his eyes</p>
<p>every 10 seconds he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>roberto duran when he was younger but way better</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got similar</p>
<p>he touches his belt he comes in</p>
<p>does that weird he loves</p>
<p>fighting too man even though he has so much to lose</p>
<p>he still loves fighting</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a born fighter that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think is the hardest thing is when you become</p>
<p>that biggest celebrity and you have that many fans</p>
<p>and you get into a ring</p>
<p>you have a lot to lose</p>
<p>and the great</p>
<p>champions can somehow</p>
<p>put that out of</p>
<p>their heads</p>
<p>and he seems like</p>
<p>it makes him</p>
<p>elevate it makes him better you know</p>
<p>he seems like the weight of</p>
<p>these people behind him just makes him better</p>
<p>some people talk</p>
<p>trash it doesn&rsquo;t work some</p>
<p>other people do like</p>
<p>chelsson and obviously talking trash</p>
<p>away does it helps them it works for him i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>well the thing</p>
<p>about manny pacquiao too is that he seems to be doing</p>
<p>everything perfectly</p>
<p>he seems to be a really nice guy</p>
<p>yeah didn&rsquo;t you tell me he also</p>
<p>plays a pool like really well like professional level</p>
<p>he plays better than me</p>
<p>he plays professional</p>
<p>level pool that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>one thing he&rsquo;s not good at is singing apparently</p>
<p>well yeah he</p>
<p>plays karaoke and shit but give him some time he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably get good at that too if you really wanted to</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be if you</p>
<p>people talk enough shit</p>
<p>about his singing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll probably hire</p>
<p>voice coaches and just become one of the badass</p>
<p>opera singers of our</p>
<p>generation would</p>
<p>never be able to deny him he&rsquo;s just a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker him</p>
<p>versus old tyson who</p>
<p>would you sit go with</p>
<p>oh come on he&rsquo;s a tiny guy i know but if it was</p>
<p>if they were the</p>
<p>same size well</p>
<p>you know that was the most interesting</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>tyson when he was</p>
<p>young is that he</p>
<p>moved like a man much</p>
<p>smaller than him</p>
<p>you watch like the mike</p>
<p>tyson marvis frazier fight</p>
<p>that is one of the most disturbing boxing matches ever</p>
<p>cause marvis knew what was</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>we knew it was</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>tyson knew it was</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>the announcers knew it was</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>they were all talking</p>
<p>about it this is</p>
<p>a lot of people saying this is a mismatch and then</p>
<p>tyson just comes</p>
<p>raring at him</p>
<p>moving in frames</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even seeing all</p>
<p>of his movements because he&rsquo;s moving so goddamn fast</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden he&rsquo;s hurling</p>
<p>these left hooks in your direction</p>
<p>and you feel your</p>
<p>rib cage imploding</p>
<p>and before you even</p>
<p>react to it another one&rsquo;s hit you on the</p>
<p>other side of the head</p>
<p>he was having</p>
<p>trouble finding sparring partners</p>
<p>because he was</p>
<p>crushing people</p>
<p>he moved so fast that was the</p>
<p>thing he didn&rsquo;t move like ali</p>
<p>where you know</p>
<p>would move with</p>
<p>fancy footwork and</p>
<p>dance around joe</p>
<p>frazier style</p>
<p>but different because</p>
<p>with both hands you know</p>
<p>he would throw</p>
<p>rights and lefts with</p>
<p>equal abandon</p>
<p>you know whereas</p>
<p>joe frazier was a big left hooker and he had a decent</p>
<p>right hand but it was nothing like</p>
<p>tyson&rsquo;s tyson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>famous for that</p>
<p>right hook to the body</p>
<p>right uppercut combination</p>
<p>he was a fucking</p>
<p>for one brief moment one</p>
<p>brief period of history</p>
<p>he changed that</p>
<p>whole sport</p>
<p>he changed watching boxing</p>
<p>watching boxing was</p>
<p>never watching an</p>
<p>execution okay</p>
<p>when marvin hagler was</p>
<p>fighting good guys like when he was</p>
<p>fighting john the</p>
<p>beast mugabe</p>
<p>it was like a big fight</p>
<p>everybody got</p>
<p>excited about</p>
<p>it like holy shit mugabe&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>knockout punch</p>
<p>right and it was a</p>
<p>fight so mugabe</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>terry norris mugabe</p>
<p>is a bad motherfucker mugabe&rsquo;s got serious power</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>could be the</p>
<p>fight for haggar</p>
<p>mike tyson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fights were executions</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bruce eldon</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s mike</p>
<p>tyson look at</p>
<p>bruce elden&rsquo;s knee shake</p>
<p>you know all of a sudden</p>
<p>tyson&rsquo;s charging</p>
<p>after him boom the</p>
<p>fight&rsquo;s over well you know what they said is</p>
<p>don king used to set up monitors</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d have a highlight reel of</p>
<p>tyson knocking dudes out and when you were</p>
<p>gonna fight him he</p>
<p>would always</p>
<p>set the monitors up so the</p>
<p>fighter in the mgm</p>
<p>would have to walk through that</p>
<p>don king was nuts that way and so you&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>fighting him and you just see</p>
<p>these highlight</p>
<p>wheels of him like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s crushing dudes in slow motion that makes sense</p>
<p>some of the monitors pay attention you gotta go</p>
<p>fight mike tyson some of those guys were so intimidated</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge i met him</p>
<p>one time in vegas</p>
<p>tyson and you just get put on weight but he&rsquo;s so thick</p>
<p>like his hand is so thick</p>
<p>his his his hips and his head</p>
<p>everything is just so wide you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>a different human being i never grow</p>
<p>yeah well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he was just so compact and fast</p>
<p>he was a new model heavyweight</p>
<p>shorter than</p>
<p>six feet tall to me to me to me like if you</p>
<p>would have picked the prototype of what i</p>
<p>just the ultimate like top of the food chain dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;d like to look like i always wear</p>
<p>black shorts and</p>
<p>black shoes</p>
<p>would you remember when he came out of prison</p>
<p>and he was super yoked</p>
<p>like he came out of prison</p>
<p>in prison all he was doing was push ups and sit ups and</p>
<p>dips and getting tattooed</p>
<p>with fucking</p>
<p>controversial</p>
<p>peace features</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll take down killing</p>
<p>about 40 million people</p>
<p>how crazy is the arthur ash</p>
<p>tattoo it&rsquo;s like alright</p>

<p>doesn&rsquo;t he doesn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>jay and bow</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>motherfucker man for that</p>
<p>brief moment like i said that guy</p>
<p>he changed the</p>
<p>whole sport</p>
<p>changed the whole</p>
<p>sport he lost his</p>
<p>trainer right right</p>
<p>well lost a</p>
<p>bunch of things there was a</p>
<p>bunch of things that happened</p>
<p>you know fame happened and also</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible to keep up the</p>
<p>level of rpms that</p>
<p>he was operating at you know when he was at the very</p>
<p>top of his game when he was like challenging for the</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>

<p>training you</p>

<p>can they get in and hold you on twitter are you</p>
<p>gonna have auditions</p>
<p>for the band you know i</p>
<p>would but you know for me i just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny i wish i played an instrument i</p>
<p>never had the patience</p>
<p>what fascinates me is why some people choose certain</p>
<p>instruments like the guitar i get it you get laid the</p>
<p>piano the drums</p>
<p>the tuba that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the dumbest fucking instrument like there&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>a song really yeah you&rsquo;re just you need a huge</p>
<p>brass band and</p>
<p>you only play like boom boom boom boom boom you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no real</p>
<p>like full songs for the tuba or like</p>
<p>what else there&rsquo;s a couple of like the accordion</p>
<p>certain things that people have a calling for that are</p>
<p>fascinating i always used to love</p>
<p>what was that</p>
<p>movie the spike lee</p>
<p>movie about jazz</p>
<p>with denzel washington</p>
<p>yeah what was that</p>
<p>called better blues yeah</p>
<p>more better blues yeah</p>
<p>and i used to love</p>
<p>watching like</p>
<p>like the part</p>
<p>where denzel washington</p>
<p>would take out his</p>
<p>trumpet and he would</p>
<p>clean it it was like a ritual</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would go through</p>
<p>all his practice routines like he was so desperate</p>
<p>disciplined</p>
<p>about his practice well</p>
<p>trump explains</p>
<p>how to get out i&rsquo;m like i</p>
<p>gotta practice</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah you know whitten</p>
<p>marseaus talks</p>
<p>about that he&rsquo;s considered by many to be the</p>
<p>greatest jazz</p>
<p>trumpeter you know in the world and</p>
<p>was he the dude that was on the tonight show</p>
<p>or was it his brother no that was his brother branford</p>
<p>but witness</p>
<p>is considered a</p>
<p>real maestro like</p>
<p>in the same pantheon as like</p>
<p>yo yo ma or even</p>
<p>louis armstrong</p>
<p>so he just completely</p>
<p>dedicated to the art yeah</p>
<p>by the time he was 19 he was on a</p>
<p>physical technical</p>
<p>level with the</p>
<p>trumpet that you</p>
<p>know was so far</p>
<p>superseded anybody in the</p>
<p>field almost</p>
<p>and they also say and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard this from people like</p>
<p>harry connick jr and</p>
<p>stuff who say that</p>
<p>he does things on a</p>
<p>trumpet you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not physically supposed to be able to do like</p>
<p>your fingers aren&rsquo;t supposed to be able to do that</p>
<p>stuff really yeah</p>
<p>cause he can just move them so</p>
<p>fast i mean</p>
<p>such dexterity in the</p>
<p>things that he does but</p>
<p>he talks a lot about</p>
<p>you know just what practice means</p>
<p>and the kind of</p>
<p>thing that i believe he</p>
<p>still blows on a read an hour a day</p>
<p>which is like a beginner&rsquo;s thing</p>
<p>but he says</p>
<p>if you know the daily</p>
<p>practice the</p>
<p>daily adherence to practice</p>
<p>is what changes</p>
<p>everything and not only that he also talks</p>
<p>about like when you do a performance</p>
<p>you come off and you got a high and you killed it</p>
<p>that energy</p>
<p>a lot of people go well i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a couple</p>
<p>drinks and celebrate</p>
<p>actually what a guy like that&rsquo;ll do is go i got</p>
<p>all this new energy</p>
<p>and he goes and shuts himself in the room and practices</p>
<p>even more with that newfound sort of rush that energy</p>
<p>and he talks</p>
<p>about the difference between being</p>
<p>truly great and</p>
<p>truly original</p>
<p>and being like everybody else are those</p>
<p>kinds of things</p>
<p>like pushing yourself to that</p>
<p>level everybody has</p>
<p>their own process of course</p>
<p>but nobody practices as much as he does</p>
<p>you know he was talking</p>
<p>about yeah that discipline</p>
<p>the adherence to discipline is so</p>
<p>attractive you know in my mind it&rsquo;s like so what i</p>
<p>would like to be doing</p>
<p>you know i stay as disciplined as i can</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m so fucking impulsive</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many different things</p>
<p>entering into my interest all the time</p>
<p>and part of me says well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where some of my</p>
<p>creativity comes</p>
<p>from is this fascination with a constant need for</p>
<p>all this new information and new</p>
<p>things and yeah but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a distraction yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s massive and i also</p>
<p>think that in some ways like i always</p>
<p>think that you get to a certain</p>
<p>point in your life</p>
<p>where you in a way know everything</p>
<p>that you need to know to create something</p>
<p>perfect and beautiful yeah but it&rsquo;s not new</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s new current shit</p>
<p>which is the most fascinating</p>
<p>thing to me and</p>
<p>the crazy thing</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on the internet now is every</p>
<p>goddamn day</p>
<p>you get twitter messages and</p>
<p>message board messages on</p>
<p>the rogan board</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these new incredible</p>
<p>scientific discoveries</p>
<p>all these new</p>
<p>weird things that are happening around the</p>
<p>world like the thousand fucking</p>
<p>thousands of birds</p>
<p>that have died and fallen from the sky in arkansas</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going what the fuck is going on</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>heard that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>viral just because they&rsquo;re filming</p>
<p>angry birds</p>
<p>right now what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>viral videos are</p>
<p>you serious for the</p>
<p>angry birds movie</p>
<p>are you serious</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>rumor that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going around there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna kill thousands no</p>
<p>no they think</p>
<p>what happened they actually</p>
<p>think what happened was that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>fireworks in new year&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>roused them from their</p>
<p>sleep and they</p>
<p>ran they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see and ran into like different chimneys and</p>
<p>everything they just</p>
<p>they stay that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s thousands of them and they&rsquo;re over</p>
<p>fields and shit the</p>
<p>thousands of them got scared and fell from the sky dead</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sound right</p>
<p>sounds like bird flu or something maybe it</p>
<p>sounds like they fucking poison them or something</p>
<p>that sounds more like</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s probably some you know</p>
<p>cloud or something there&rsquo;s the conspiracy theory</p>
<p>angle there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>that are trying to pawn it off on this one guy</p>
<p>i should know this man&rsquo;s name so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna look it up right now</p>
<p>but this guy</p>
<p>just got killed</p>
<p>and he was a chemical weapons expert</p>
<p>and he was tortured and murdered</p>
<p>and i think yeah and they</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s some sort of a</p>
<p>connection to it</p>
<p>that the guy</p>
<p>turned up missing and</p>
<p>turned up missing and i</p>
<p>think in delaware and they</p>
<p>found him in a landfill</p>
<p>he had been murdered</p>
<p>yeah and they believe that this guy</p>
<p>was yeah here he is</p>
<p>yes official yeah he</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really kind of creepy man</p>
<p>their stories are very</p>
<p>bizarre because this guy was like</p>
<p>he worked under george</p>
<p>herbert walker bush as well</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>expert in in</p>
<p>weapons in biological weapons and chemical weapons</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy shit man</p>
<p>and the of course the conspiracy angle</p>
<p>is that they were testing something and killed all</p>
<p>these birds off and he might have protested</p>
<p>or freaked out or you know</p>
<p>i spent a lot of time</p>
<p>reading history and</p>
<p>one of the things i like about doing that as opposed to</p>
<p>even looking at</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re headed is how how</p>
<p>little how much changes but also how little changes</p>
<p>in a lot of ways the man&rsquo;s name is john p</p>
<p>wheeler for anybody who wants to look into the story</p>
<p>john h a o h n p</p>
<p>wheeler w h e e l e r</p>
<p>and just type that into google and i&rsquo;m sure a</p>
<p>bunch of different stories will come up on this guy</p>
<p>this is somebody printed do all the</p>
<p>websites end with like is</p>
<p>or anything no some of them are</p>
<p>well the ones that are</p>
<p>legit ones that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>claiming any sort of conspiracy</p>
<p>those are interesting</p>
<p>because what they talked</p>
<p>about is the fact that this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>television was turned on full</p>
<p>blast and it freaked</p>
<p>out his neighbors because he was really a kind of a</p>
<p>quiet guy and he was an</p>
<p>older guy didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why</p>
<p>television was</p>
<p>blasting like that well</p>
<p>television really loud is one of the ways they hide the</p>
<p>sounds of torture</p>
<p>so they found this guy&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and there was a yellow police tape in his</p>
<p>kitchen and they pulled up</p>
<p>floorboards and</p>
<p>they roped off a chair</p>
<p>so the idea is that</p>
<p>it was very possible they</p>
<p>might have tortured this guy before they killed him</p>
<p>they might have tortured him in his own house</p>
<p>and then they killed him and then took him to a dump</p>
<p>damn yeah it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting when a guy has that sort of a background</p>
<p>you know so you know and like i said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying by the conspiracy theory i&rsquo;m saying you know</p>
<p>first of all it&rsquo;s creepy that this guy got</p>
<p>fucking tortured and murdered</p>
<p>or at least the very</p>
<p>least murdered the tortured part of speculation at this</p>
<p>point but it&rsquo;s an interesting little thing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it has anything to do with all these</p>
<p>yeah that seems like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you could pretty much connect anyone from that</p>
<p>story to that</p>
<p>story if you really had</p>
<p>you know typed without</p>
<p>not yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just guesswork</p>
<p>yeah sure yeah</p>
<p>i mean basically we&rsquo;re just making</p>
<p>pieces of fiction we</p>
<p>only know if he&rsquo;s connected to it</p>
<p>but the idea is</p>
<p>oh dude that was what i want to talk to you</p>
<p>about in abu dhabi this year they made it rain</p>
<p>52 times did you know that</p>
<p>they made it rain</p>
<p>cloud seeding</p>
<p>yeah silver eye</p>
<p>like a strip club they&rsquo;ve been doing they&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>cloud seating since</p>
<p>they probably made it rain there more</p>
<p>than 52 times</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>cloud seating for many many years</p>
<p>yeah but this is something that they&rsquo;ve come public</p>
<p>about in that</p>
<p>abu dhabi is better at</p>
<p>using they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using as a weekly strategy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like i</p>
<p>mean 52 times that&rsquo;s like once a week man that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>if they choose to</p>
<p>space it out like that why they want to make it</p>
<p>greener they&rsquo;re very ambitious yeah</p>
<p>how crazy is that</p>
<p>where they getting the drawing</p>
<p>their water from it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>before them</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s moisture in the air and especially</p>
<p>where they live they&rsquo;re near a lot of ocean yeah</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s moisture in the air and you have to coax</p>
<p>it out but i mean what are the repercussions</p>
<p>what are the repercussions of that i mean what is</p>
<p>i mean how safe is it to be</p>
<p>spraying shit in the</p>
<p>air well they&rsquo;ve been doing it for many years i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve always done</p>
<p>cloud seeding i don&rsquo;t know how effective</p>
<p>it is and i don&rsquo;t know how good they&rsquo;ve gotten at it</p>
<p>i know that that&rsquo;s been around for</p>
<p>since at least the 70s</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;re getting better at it yeah</p>
<p>this abu dhabi</p>
<p>thing was fascinating</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard it discussed on like cnn com</p>
<p>or you know any major</p>
<p>in major news website but that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>were talking</p>
<p>about abu dhabi is very is is</p>
<p>is i guess from what i&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>becoming really ambitious</p>
<p>they really want to become sort of the new arab</p>
<p>that center for the new arab</p>
<p>world you know this sort of</p>
<p>the beacon of</p>
<p>light if you will for</p>
<p>a different way of doing</p>
<p>things yeah they got</p>
<p>crazy paper dude</p>
<p>they got crazy paper</p>
<p>they got crazy</p>
<p>paper but living like that man making</p>
<p>artificial fucking rain showers holy shit that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>you know it just you always wonder</p>
<p>is that gonna affect something somewhere else</p>
<p>is forcing it to</p>
<p>rain somewhere else forcing like a fucking hurricane to</p>
<p>to grow over here on the</p>
<p>other side i mean</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the sky all somehow or another connected</p>
<p>is the environment</p>
<p>connecting so i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that no i don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>localized you know rain seeding and</p>
<p>cloud seeding is</p>
<p>over how big of an area it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>difficult to do</p>
<p>well but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you can do it over a large area</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to do i think so</p>
<p>if they figure out how to do</p>
<p>it all the time and obviously they have they&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>52 times that&rsquo;s pretty consistent</p>
<p>if they just decide to do that that</p>
<p>would be such a trip</p>
<p>if all of a</p>
<p>sudden we went over to</p>
<p>to abu dhabi</p>
<p>it was like west palm</p>
<p>beach florida</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s in a way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re headed we&rsquo;re headed we are</p>
<p>becoming more</p>
<p>and more in control of our environment or at</p>
<p>least trying to be but then</p>
<p>again we&rsquo;re also losing</p>
<p>some control of it if you</p>
<p>buy into the</p>
<p>whole global</p>
<p>warming you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story of the</p>
<p>anunnaki that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story from the</p>
<p>sumerian text</p>
<p>reason why human beings were invented</p>
<p>the zechariah</p>
<p>sitch and craziness you know</p>
<p>about all this</p>
<p>the story was that these</p>
<p>alien beings from another planet</p>
<p>came to earth because they had ruined their</p>
<p>atmosphere with</p>
<p>their technological race and so</p>
<p>they ruined</p>
<p>their atmosphere and they needed gold particles</p>
<p>to suspend in</p>
<p>their atmosphere to protect</p>
<p>them from radiation in the sun and shit like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>well yeah and that they had done exactly what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to do</p>
<p>right now hmm</p>
<p>and the it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>ridiculous thing ever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>twelfth planet</p>
<p>and he wrote it back in 1970 but what&rsquo;s fascinating is</p>
<p>the idea of suspending particles in the</p>
<p>atmosphere that had</p>
<p>never been discussed</p>
<p>until like the year 2000</p>
<p>and they had like a global symposium on</p>
<p>protecting the</p>
<p>earth from environmental hazards like</p>
<p>losing the ozone</p>
<p>layer losing</p>
<p>our atmosphere</p>
<p>and that was one of the</p>
<p>suggestions for suspend</p>
<p>reflective particles in the</p>
<p>atmosphere that&rsquo;s pretty wild yeah you</p>
<p>could do that you could</p>
<p>fill the sky</p>
<p>with silver</p>
<p>and gold particles well gold</p>
<p>the crazy thing</p>
<p>about gold is</p>
<p>that tiny little</p>
<p>piece of gold</p>
<p>can spread out so far gold dust is so fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible we&rsquo;re moving the</p>
<p>other issues</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually they just created bacteria strains</p>
<p>from a computer in</p>
<p>other words they</p>
<p>cross pollinated</p>
<p>dna and created</p>
<p>life forms bacteria forms that had</p>
<p>never existed on earth</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>synthetic biology this guy</p>
<p>craig venter and his team if you go to</p>
<p>ted com you can see his</p>
<p>lecture and when</p>
<p>they for the</p>
<p>first time on a printer</p>
<p>they print it out</p>
<p>essentially the</p>
<p>structure for a</p>
<p>completely new life form</p>
<p>and that has far reaching</p>
<p>implications</p>
<p>in the sense that</p>
<p>for the first time</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>might very well be able to control</p>
<p>their own evolution</p>
<p>and certainly create</p>
<p>new life form dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be such a fucking mess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna create</p>
<p>rover berserkers in</p>
<p>russia it comes with</p>
<p>great promise but also peril</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m investing in fire</p>
<p>yeah no shit you can&rsquo;t get me with your</p>
<p>paper monster what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make new life forms with your computer</p>
<p>how nuts is that fuck things are getting weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting i think it&rsquo;s gonna get i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna get to a point where we won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really be able to figure out like</p>
<p>you know like i was thinking i&rsquo;m reading this</p>
<p>you guys if you ever</p>
<p>just take three</p>
<p>months and do it</p>
<p>or two months i&rsquo;m reading</p>
<p>blood meridian cormac mccarthy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>masterpiece</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s considered by when they reviewed it in</p>
<p>85 they said this is one of the</p>
<p>great feats of language in the past 50 years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about novel</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a novel and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about the sort of the</p>
<p>settling of the west and it follows this track this</p>
<p>group of 19 or so</p>
<p>men who are hunting indians hunting</p>
<p>scouts it&rsquo;s a brutal book what&rsquo;s it called</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>blood meridian</p>
<p>blood meridian</p>
<p>and you know we</p>
<p>all know what happened a lot of people may not but what</p>
<p>happened to the native americans and it&rsquo;s the same old</p>
<p>story of one</p>
<p>group comes in with guns and</p>
<p>they basically decimate</p>
<p>you know not just with disease but with bullets and</p>
<p>everything else but</p>
<p>god i forgot what i was</p>
<p>gonna say but it was about</p>
<p>oh yeah what i was</p>
<p>gonna say is that</p>
<p>and if you look at what happened as they</p>
<p>started settling the west</p>
<p>is that the</p>
<p>the europeans</p>
<p>were killing</p>
<p>not just all the buffalo they were killing all the</p>
<p>other animals as well they got really efficient</p>
<p>at it because as they lay the railroad they</p>
<p>would shoot buffalo</p>
<p>and of course and then they</p>
<p>would lace the</p>
<p>bodies with</p>
<p>strychnine now why</p>
<p>would you do that because all the</p>
<p>other animals</p>
<p>would feed on the buffalo and they would die</p>
<p>of the strychnine</p>
<p>so then you</p>
<p>could skin them and send all</p>
<p>those pelts to europe and to the east</p>
<p>and to the east</p>
<p>coast and stuff</p>
<p>where there was big money</p>
<p>so in a course of 20 years probably</p>
<p>500 million animals died</p>
<p>look at old</p>
<p>paintings and</p>
<p>pictures of the</p>
<p>great plains in america</p>
<p>they looked like the serengeti</p>
<p>and in the course of 20 years</p>
<p>literally we killed all the buffalo and so many</p>
<p>other animals not just the</p>
<p>wolves that fed on the buffalo</p>
<p>after we killed them but</p>
<p>everything else</p>
<p>and so what happened for</p>
<p>a lot of the native americans was</p>
<p>their entire mythology</p>
<p>entire mythology</p>
<p>religions were</p>
<p>wrapped up with</p>
<p>their environment and the animals around them</p>
<p>and in 20 years they were all gone</p>
<p>forget the fact that they were starved</p>
<p>to death but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very they&rsquo;re very mythology</p>
<p>their very religion</p>
<p>what the cornerstone of</p>
<p>their culture</p>
<p>was eradicated</p>
<p>and you really wonder</p>
<p>you know what psychologically they were</p>
<p>going through as they saw</p>
<p>this true holocaust sort of unfold for them you know</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a stupid when you</p>
<p>think about how</p>
<p>short of a time period that is</p>
<p>right and i always</p>
<p>think are we</p>
<p>gonna come up with a certain kind of</p>
<p>technology that does the same to us</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the question i mean</p>
<p>nothing says that our</p>
<p>culture and our way of life and our even lives</p>
<p>are guaranteed by anything</p>
<p>i mean if you&rsquo;re very religious you believe it is</p>
<p>but for people who tend to have more of a</p>
<p>scientific bent</p>
<p>or have a take a real look at history</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that you know</p>
<p>there are threats out there</p>
<p>eventually maybe of our own</p>
<p>design that</p>
<p>could render us extinct or</p>
<p>maybe of our own design yeah</p>
<p>the idea is that life keeps</p>
<p>going in a direction of more</p>
<p>complexity yeah</p>
<p>things getting more and more complicated and the issue</p>
<p>with the indians was</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with okay american indians native</p>
<p>americans were dealing with people that were so fucking</p>
<p>crazy they were willing to get in boats</p>
<p>and go across the</p>
<p>ocean and across the</p>
<p>country a better</p>
<p>place to live</p>
<p>oh yeah you know and then just</p>
<p>trekk out on their own</p>
<p>to the middle of the fucking country this</p>
<p>giant continent that was literally</p>
<p>filled with</p>
<p>people that were living like</p>
<p>the rest of the</p>
<p>world they were living</p>
<p>much much much more</p>
<p>modern i mean american indians</p>
<p>before we had introduced</p>
<p>or the spaniards</p>
<p>rather had introduced</p>
<p>horses to them</p>
<p>i mean they were like nomadic</p>
<p>tepee living</p>
<p>arrow shooting</p>
<p>motherfuckers you know i mean</p>
<p>it was really crazy like</p>
<p>they were living just like the people that they find</p>
<p>today in the amazon rainforest they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still finding people like that today</p>
<p>they found a</p>
<p>bunch of new tribes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t remember the number</p>
<p>but they have this fascinating photo</p>
<p>of one that they</p>
<p>found that&rsquo;s near the peru</p>
<p>and brazil border</p>
<p>and their skin</p>
<p>is covered with</p>
<p>ink they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>covered with red ink</p>
<p>and two of them are red and one of them looks like a</p>
<p>black color</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>covered with like this</p>
<p>crazy war paint</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>holding bows</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pointing</p>
<p>arrows at the airplanes as the airplanes take</p>
<p>pictures of them</p>
<p>these are undiscovered</p>
<p>untouched tribes that are</p>
<p>completely isolated from the rest of the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s wild</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s really what american indians</p>
<p>were like native americans were like and unfortunately</p>
<p>whatever the fuck</p>
<p>humanity is</p>
<p>doing here on this planet what we&rsquo;re trying to do is</p>
<p>more better faster bigger what the fuck</p>
<p>are you get out of my way more better faster bigger</p>
<p>how about a fucking</p>
<p>metal box that rolls on</p>
<p>metal train</p>
<p>tracks and it goes</p>
<p>300 fucking</p>
<p>miles an hour and cuts across the</p>
<p>whole country i mean</p>
<p>we just more better faster more better faster</p>
<p>living in teepees is just getting in the way</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about sacred ground</p>
<p>sacred ground</p>
<p>sacred ground like this is</p>
<p>money okay we</p>
<p>gotta kill you we</p>
<p>gotta kill these people we</p>
<p>gotta kill them we</p>
<p>gotta kill them we</p>
<p>gotta kill them they&rsquo;re not reasonable</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same old</p>
<p>story history is</p>
<p>full of that stuff</p>
<p>the history is full of one</p>
<p>group that comes into another</p>
<p>group and says you guys are in the way man you</p>
<p>gotta either</p>
<p>leave or die</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>wrong i mean</p>
<p>no one is justifying it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely heinous</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting</p>
<p>objectively stepping away from the</p>
<p>whole idea of emotions and</p>
<p>humanity and people in genocide and all that stuff</p>
<p>if you look at it as like you know in</p>
<p>a direction</p>
<p>that humanity is well</p>
<p>the point is</p>
<p>that the unimaginable can happen to people yeah</p>
<p>and it happens to</p>
<p>huge groups of people</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the russian the ukrainians in the 1930s</p>
<p>under stalin</p>
<p>or the jews</p>
<p>under hitler</p>
<p>and you know in the</p>
<p>later 30s and up to 45</p>
<p>the unimaginable</p>
<p>the unspeakable</p>
<p>can happen to millions of people</p>
<p>millions of</p>
<p>people can perish and appear to make</p>
<p>the argument</p>
<p>people will</p>
<p>make the argument but that was then and now at the</p>
<p>age of information that&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>look at the i record we&rsquo;ve not</p>
<p>changed that much</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>the one difference i will say</p>
<p>about history thank god</p>
<p>is that it becomes harder for bad men to get away with</p>
<p>things for a long period of time because</p>
<p>there are a lot of people watching</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a very good thing</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>going to have if you have an incentive</p>
<p>structure that gives</p>
<p>there are always people in society</p>
<p>who are willing to do what</p>
<p>others won&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>and those people always</p>
<p>flourish in</p>
<p>chaos they always</p>
<p>flourish in war</p>
<p>when russia fell</p>
<p>apart that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the people that are willing to do what</p>
<p>others won&rsquo;t do that always rise to the top</p>
<p>in a situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no rule of law etc</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the enemy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you have to</p>
<p>fight for representative government you have to</p>
<p>fight for all the</p>
<p>things the founding fathers talked</p>
<p>about because it keeps bad men in check</p>
<p>and so whenever you</p>
<p>start blaming</p>
<p>individuals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like kind of blaming the way of the world</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always gonna have</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>gonna have bad people</p>
<p>you want a system that keeps them somewhat neutered</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>and people that want to be separate</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the the</p>
<p>logic of countries and man it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>stupid man it&rsquo;s all stupid</p>
<p>i want to show you a</p>
<p>video and the</p>
<p>video is it&rsquo;s the hodge on the mosque i know all</p>
<p>about the hodge and</p>
<p>the hodge on mecca</p>
<p>and watching all</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>mill around that post and go listen if it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you and your</p>
<p>scantly connected</p>
<p>group of friends</p>
<p>and you have some sort of a conflict with a</p>
<p>group that&rsquo;s as connected as</p>
<p>these motherfuckers</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re willing to do a lot of crazy</p>
<p>shit well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not willing to die but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>quite beautiful</p>
<p>about the hive it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>and the hodge is beautiful because</p>
<p>the notion is you wear two sheets</p>
<p>and whether you&rsquo;re a prince or a pauper</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the same</p>
<p>group you wear two sheets when you go on your</p>
<p>pilgrimage to mecca and</p>
<p>every muslim has to do it once in</p>
<p>their life at</p>
<p>least you go and</p>
<p>you fast from sun up to sun down</p>
<p>and usually if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>strict i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re allowed to</p>
<p>drink water</p>
<p>but the notion is we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>equal under the eyes of god</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>egalitarian</p>
<p>movement so when they make</p>
<p>their pilgrimage to mecca</p>
<p>they wear two sheets and they</p>
<p>are so you can be</p>
<p>right next to somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth a billion dollars and you have nothing</p>
<p>but under the eyes of god when you&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>you guys are</p>
<p>all the same you&rsquo;re all eating the same food you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>behaving the same way</p>
<p>and it was this</p>
<p>notion that muhammad came up with this notion that look</p>
<p>you always have to go and</p>
<p>basically we</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s got to be somewhat of a communal</p>
<p>a communal pilgrimage</p>
<p>a humbling pilgrimage</p>
<p>to show each</p>
<p>other that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all the same yeah it&rsquo;s kind of a unified</p>
<p>movement very important and ritualistic</p>
<p>things like absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely what</p>
<p>is that box supposed to represent that big square</p>
<p>building that i believe is</p>
<p>where muhammad was buried</p>
<p>muhammad i believe was born in medina</p>
<p>and he died in mecca</p>
<p>and medina and mecca and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>muslim and i&rsquo;m getting them mixed</p>
<p>switched around but</p>
<p>medina and mecca are the most</p>
<p>they are the most</p>
<p>religious places in</p>
<p>islam they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>truly the most religious</p>
<p>places in islam when you pray</p>
<p>you pray toward mecca</p>
<p>so when you go to</p>
<p>hotels or things in</p>
<p>in the arab</p>
<p>world muslim</p>
<p>world a lot of times they have arrows</p>
<p>pointing to mecca</p>
<p>is there a monocratic iphone app</p>
<p>there may very well be i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>surprised there</p>
<p>was has to be there has to be if there is tweet</p>
<p>yeah if there&rsquo;s not out there developers</p>
<p>you know what the fuck to do you need to make a</p>
<p>mecha iphone app i need to know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll pay my respects to its mecca</p>
<p>so he was buried there</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s incredible so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under that box somewhere his remain</p>
<p>i believe that&rsquo;s the stone</p>
<p>he was i believe and i just read about this and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry that i don&rsquo;t know it but i believe</p>
<p>that the stone</p>
<p>was where muhammad received</p>
<p>a message from sort of an angel</p>
<p>about the quran</p>
<p>because remember that the</p>
<p>muslims always believed that there was one person that</p>
<p>spoke through god and that was</p>
<p>muhammad and their</p>
<p>proof was that he was an illiterate shepherd</p>
<p>who over the course of seven years wrote the sunna</p>
<p>wrote wrote</p>
<p>essentially the quran</p>
<p>the quran being</p>
<p>essentially a bunch of poems it&rsquo;s written in verse</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite beautiful it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very intricate and with</p>
<p>these incredible and stories and stuff</p>
<p>and they said how could one man</p>
<p>write all this in seven years he was inspired he</p>
<p>never learned how to write read or</p>
<p>write but he was obviously had some kind of a</p>
<p>revelation or an inspiration</p>
<p>and so that was what that was</p>
<p>where muhammad</p>
<p>really made his</p>
<p>name and not only did he do that but muhammad</p>
<p>also was the guy who said look</p>
<p>this is a bunch of</p>
<p>tribes a bunch of pagan</p>
<p>tribes i&rsquo;m gonna unite</p>
<p>the people of saudi arabia</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna unite these people</p>
<p>these nomads i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna stop them from</p>
<p>fighting each</p>
<p>other and i&rsquo;m gonna create one</p>
<p>group of people</p>
<p>under one banner of heaven</p>
<p>and that was the notion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>how fucking radical they are to the gotten to the</p>
<p>point where you can&rsquo;t even draw</p>
<p>muhammad or you it&rsquo;s a shame</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a shame</p>
<p>because historically</p>
<p>islam was actually</p>
<p>always a religion that was so open to interpretation</p>
<p>and in fact look look look at indonesia indonesia for</p>
<p>until very recently and even</p>
<p>still was always</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>muslim country for many many many years</p>
<p>and has always been a very very open</p>
<p>and tolerant society remember</p>
<p>that the jews</p>
<p>who were persecuted and killed by the christians</p>
<p>always went to</p>
<p>muslim countries first</p>
<p>muslims were the ones that actually</p>
<p>protected the jews because they were people of the book</p>
<p>the quran upholds</p>
<p>every story in the old testament</p>
<p>it believes that the old testament to be gospel</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of</p>
<p>a rebuttal to the new testament with the notion that</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>that it considers to be a</p>
<p>great prophet</p>
<p>the notion that christians say that</p>
<p>jesus christ is actually god is</p>
<p>where they take</p>
<p>issue and that was</p>
<p>where the big rift was</p>
<p>but remember that</p>
<p>islam was always a place</p>
<p>for the most</p>
<p>part islamic</p>
<p>countries like the</p>
<p>ottoman empire</p>
<p>was a place</p>
<p>where the jews took refuge and</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why this</p>
<p>rift between jews and</p>
<p>muslims over</p>
<p>the founding of the</p>
<p>state of israel in 1948 that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where all of this came from</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so unfortunate</p>
<p>about all of</p>
<p>well at one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>the the the</p>
<p>muslim religion or</p>
<p>muslim people were</p>
<p>responsible for an incredible amount of inventions to</p>
<p>absolutely well look at</p>
<p>the scientifically adventure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the ottoman empire for god&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t what it is</p>
<p>today and what happened that that that fucked</p>
<p>everything up and</p>
<p>got it to the</p>
<p>point where it is</p>
<p>today where there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like so many</p>
<p>things degrade</p>
<p>and get to a</p>
<p>point where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not what you know i would</p>
<p>argue i would</p>
<p>argue that and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not a political scientist and i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just a goddamn actor but i did live there for</p>
<p>eight years of my life and i</p>
<p>would argue that</p>
<p>the middle east&rsquo;s biggest problem is not</p>
<p>i think i believe that islamic</p>
<p>fundamentalism</p>
<p>was came out of the</p>
<p>fact that the 22 governments in the middle east are not</p>
<p>democracies</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve always been monarchies and</p>
<p>dictatorships</p>
<p>and those monarchies and</p>
<p>dictatorships</p>
<p>kept people in poverty</p>
<p>when you keep people in poverty</p>
<p>and you have a</p>
<p>bunch of men that</p>
<p>have no jobs and nothing to make themselves feel good</p>
<p>about themselves</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna turn to something man</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna turn to something like a religion</p>
<p>because it makes them and</p>
<p>men do this kind of</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>again we have historical evidence for that</p>
<p>where people say</p>
<p>look there are christian</p>
<p>fundamentalists there are jewish</p>
<p>fundamentalists</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all over the place</p>
<p>but somehow</p>
<p>along the way</p>
<p>this became a perverted notion of</p>
<p>islam where</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna solve my problems with violence i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna blow myself up and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go to heaven</p>
<p>this is all very new man</p>
<p>and religious</p>
<p>fundamentalism is fairly new</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a 20th century invention i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard a lot</p>
<p>of people and i don&rsquo;t know if this is accurate but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard it from more than one source</p>
<p>where people were connecting the mujahideen</p>
<p>and their fight</p>
<p>against the soviet union and</p>
<p>their work with the cia creating</p>
<p>a bunch of different new</p>
<p>things that happened in the</p>
<p>muslim religion</p>
<p>like suicide bombers</p>
<p>the suicide bombers</p>
<p>were actually notion of</p>
<p>jihad not really because suicide bombers would</p>
<p>they were the</p>
<p>first suicide bombers we were reading</p>
<p>about were the tamil</p>
<p>tigers actually in sri lanka</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what who those were</p>
<p>that was in the 90s the</p>
<p>early 90s i mean the tamil</p>
<p>tigers were the ones that</p>
<p>were actually blowing themselves up and nobody ever</p>
<p>heard of that we couldn&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never heard of any</p>
<p>mother so no one</p>
<p>blew themselves up</p>
<p>absolutely not</p>
<p>absolutely not</p>
<p>and what are they</p>
<p>were the sri lanka guys</p>
<p>are they muslims what are they</p>
<p>the tommil tigers i believe a lot of them are</p>
<p>hindu in fact and not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hindus with</p>
<p>first suicide violence yeah</p>
<p>so they were not</p>
<p>they were not</p>
<p>muslims had</p>
<p>such a true self</p>
<p>1990 yeah in the 90s and the tommill</p>
<p>tigers were a fierce</p>
<p>group of people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>crushed but they</p>
<p>they were trying they were trying to</p>
<p>fight for their own independence</p>
<p>their own notion of you know what they wanted but</p>
<p>so so a lot of the</p>
<p>stuff if you</p>
<p>look at the inspiration behind it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>bizarre you know</p>
<p>groups watch</p>
<p>other groups and</p>
<p>and you know so you</p>
<p>learn what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>crazy badass</p>
<p>yeah and you know listen i mean suicide bombing is not</p>
<p>in vietnam i mean you had people who would</p>
<p>a lot of like women</p>
<p>would take hand grenade and jump into a helicopter and</p>
<p>blow themselves up and everybody in the helicopter so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a human</p>
<p>thing i mean did they really just do</p>
<p>that yes so</p>
<p>there were a lot of cases of that</p>
<p>a lot of kid the</p>
<p>viet cong were a</p>
<p>tough group of people</p>
<p>who were willing to do whatever it took to get the</p>
<p>whole idea being</p>
<p>occupied like that must be so crazy</p>
<p>it is you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a normal person living your life in a hut</p>
<p>somewhere and</p>
<p>chilling and</p>
<p>having a good time then all of a</p>
<p>sudden there&rsquo;s soldiers coming in on metal</p>
<p>boxes for some reason that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pointing guns at you and</p>
<p>screaming at you</p>
<p>especially like afghanistan i mean</p>
<p>the mujahideen was</p>
<p>a good example because</p>
<p>that they were</p>
<p>basically when the soviets came in</p>
<p>first of all afghanistan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been a country you</p>
<p>gotta understand it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>been a group of</p>
<p>tribes you had the puhn</p>
<p>you had the pashtuns</p>
<p>you have the tajiks</p>

<p>against each</p>
<p>other i mean</p>

<p>twice okay i thought i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i thought you were saying you</p>
<p>lived enough</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;ve been i&rsquo;ve got to stop you live</p>
<p>you know you did always do</p>
<p>yeah but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it now when you&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>country how many countries</p>
<p>did you live i was born in the philippines</p>
<p>i then moved to</p>
<p>india where i lived in bombay and calcutta</p>
<p>which is now mumbai bombay</p>
<p>and and then i moved to</p>
<p>lebanon and then i moved to pakistan</p>
<p>and then i moved back</p>
<p>to lebanon i would be so in love with you i know</p>
<p>how do you think i get</p>
<p>so much how do you think i get laid</p>
<p>i thought you were married</p>
<p>oh sorry yeah and</p>
<p>i forgot about that part but then i moved to</p>
<p>lebanon again and the war broke out we got</p>
<p>stuck in the war and i lived in the holiday inn for six</p>
<p>months holy shit</p>
<p>but we really couldn&rsquo;t get out of the country</p>
<p>oh my god and i used to hear a machine gun and it was</p>
<p>crazy no were you</p>
<p>worried about the holiday inn getting overtaken i</p>
<p>was too young to worry about that stuff you know</p>
<p>gosh i was i think 11 or 12 holy shit and then</p>
<p>we were evacuated to greece</p>
<p>and i lived in greece and then i went to saudi arabia</p>
<p>and then by the time i was 14</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d never lived in the</p>
<p>states and i came to the states that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>yeah it was pretty wild</p>
<p>and so you get a very different perspective growing up</p>
<p>and no shit huh yeah and the world and the world</p>
<p>and what happens to the world</p>
<p>makes a difference to you you know</p>
<p>like this pakistani governor</p>
<p>you know in pakistan</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s called the blasphemy law</p>
<p>and the law is if you insult islam</p>
<p>you will be put to death</p>
<p>now when you say insult islam</p>
<p>there are a lot of ways to interpret</p>
<p>that and people use it manipulated to get rid of</p>
<p>their neighbors and things like that and this</p>
<p>governor of the punjab</p>
<p>which is an area of a</p>
<p>large area of pakistan</p>
<p>basically said</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry if it&rsquo;s punjab i thought that was</p>
<p>india but anyway but</p>
<p>he was a big governor and he said</p>
<p>he was trying to get rid of it he was trying to repeal</p>
<p>it he was trying to</p>
<p>he was a champion of</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s rights and things like that and</p>
<p>sort of a face of the more</p>
<p>modern notion of</p>
<p>not only islam but of pakistan</p>
<p>and he was assassinated</p>
<p>one of his elite</p>
<p>guards filled</p>
<p>him with 23 bullets is this recent yeah really recent</p>
<p>yeah very recent i just thought to myself i thought man</p>
<p>this stuff is</p>
<p>not dead we</p>
<p>still are in living in a</p>
<p>world of ignorance</p>
<p>and of people who are willing to</p>
<p>solve problems through violence how</p>
<p>about this crazy</p>
<p>motherfucker in</p>
<p>north korea man how</p>
<p>about that dude</p>
<p>kim jong il</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the biggest a hole in the history of the</p>
<p>world ever he wins biggest asshole of all time</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a dick</p>
<p>the crazy thing</p>
<p>about the koreans is that</p>
<p>north korea and</p>
<p>south korea are at war with each</p>
<p>other basically</p>
<p>and they look exactly the same it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy shit it&rsquo;s so bizarre to</p>
<p>did you know you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s a monarchy</p>
<p>yes north korea that&rsquo;s a for real</p>
<p>they yawned</p>
<p>while two million</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>starved to death in the 90s they just the</p>
<p>elite was like</p>
<p>pass the salt</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>no power to revolt and there&rsquo;s a massive amount of</p>
<p>patriotism it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>patriotism it&rsquo;s a religion</p>
<p>i mean the north koreans believe that the dear leader</p>
<p>is a deity man</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;ve done a good job of getting that</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that the same in thailand</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t they have a no</p>
<p>thailand is actually amazing yes thailand&rsquo;s king has a</p>
<p>he has sort</p>
<p>of he says semi deity</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s really amazing</p>
<p>about thailand</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been colonized</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve always been really good at</p>
<p>compromising they&rsquo;ve always kind of been really good at</p>
<p>figuring out a way to kind of just be the</p>
<p>place where you come for a little r and r</p>
<p>fuck war man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in laos and cambodia and vietnam us we&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>align ourselves with the us because it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>and you know you can come over and have a good</p>
<p>time and we got pretty girls and they&rsquo;re just a really</p>
<p>sweet people</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>to have such a badass</p>
<p>fighting style</p>
<p>they have you know most people believe the best</p>
<p>stand up fighting</p>
<p>style in the</p>
<p>world muay thai</p>
<p>maybe man they&rsquo;re just there</p>
<p>for a group of people that are so fucking nice to you</p>
<p>and so welcoming</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a safe</p>
<p>place man you walk around you</p>
<p>never worry you</p>

<p>but i&rsquo;m an actor</p>
<p>guys so just so</p>
<p>you know i was always doing my</p>
<p>scenes did you</p>
<p>practice muay thai</p>
<p>while you were there yes i did</p>
<p>one thing i wanted to do is go to</p>
<p>phuket and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tiger muay thai</p>
<p>thing and do</p>
<p>like i just don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s safe enough to</p>
<p>bring my whole family down there</p>
<p>you know i just like i hear it is</p>
<p>i know a lot of</p>
<p>westminers who live down there who love it why risk it</p>
<p>yeah it just seems like a</p>
<p>trippy risk i just want to do it so i could try</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s a risk and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;d be amazing for your kids to see a different</p>
<p>part of the</p>
<p>world yeah murder and shit</p>
<p>six flags is</p>
<p>pretty sweet</p>
<p>see some wild</p>
<p>monkeys i think the</p>
<p>us is way way more dangerous in some ways in a lot of</p>
<p>countries yeah</p>
<p>you know sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and stuff like</p>
<p>that someone</p>
<p>tried to tell me that about</p>
<p>i was talking</p>
<p>about going to mexico</p>
<p>like they were</p>
<p>going to mexico on cabo san</p>
<p>lucas or one of</p>
<p>those places</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>yeah but i mean fuck man don&rsquo;t you worry</p>
<p>about oh porto</p>
<p>i was like you don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about like all the violence that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in mexico</p>
<p>they go well</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s violence in america too you know</p>
<p>go to detroit you probably won&rsquo;t get caught up in it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like yeah okay</p>
<p>maybe but i know</p>
<p>where detroit is</p>
<p>and also those drug cartels from what</p>
<p>i hear are actually</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>target tourists like areas</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting to</p>
<p>target tourist areas because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get resorts to pay them off</p>
<p>because they extort</p>
<p>money from a</p>
<p>bunch of different ways</p>
<p>one of the things they</p>
<p>do is kidnap people that are trying to get to america</p>
<p>and then they go back to</p>
<p>they killed a lot of people from guatemala</p>
<p>and el salvador</p>
<p>yeah 72 men</p>
<p>and these people</p>
<p>were just people that were trying to migrate to america</p>
<p>well they asked for</p>
<p>money i guess</p>
<p>no and they</p>
<p>asked for a lot of</p>
<p>money and they said we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kill them</p>
<p>and they do it all the time and</p>
<p>apparently some people</p>
<p>pay and some</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t and the people that pay they get that</p>
<p>money and they let the people free</p>
<p>but they kill a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking people man it&rsquo;s really really</p>
<p>scary so bad</p>
<p>and you see the</p>
<p>videos of these</p>
<p>twelve year old kids that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve hired for assassins and they you know they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>completely fucked</p>
<p>these kids had really yeah</p>
<p>and some of them were</p>
<p>american kids they&rsquo;ve hired the drug cartels have hired</p>
<p>and one of them</p>
<p>got arrested recently and you know the cell</p>
<p>phone video footage of him torturing people</p>
<p>and it got onto the internet it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s horrendous</p>
<p>stuff and they tortured people before they killed them</p>
<p>you know and this 12 year old kid</p>
<p>yeah and you know i mean they so</p>
<p>evil they&rsquo;re taking violence to a</p>
<p>whole new level</p>
<p>if you look at like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the</p>
<p>world and all this you</p>
<p>know the idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re over in afghanistan so that we don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>fight it over here</p>
<p>how about what is</p>
<p>right connected to us how</p>
<p>about some shit you can</p>
<p>drive to that&rsquo;s right okay</p>
<p>cause mexico you can fucking drive to</p>
<p>and that puny ass fucking wall</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really not</p>
<p>gonna stop anybody from coming it raises</p>
<p>a bigger question is</p>
<p>would you legalize drugs and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that make</p>
<p>sense the only</p>
<p>problem is it&rsquo;s gotten to a certain</p>
<p>point where i</p>
<p>think you have to</p>
<p>squash the problem before you legalize drugs</p>
<p>because the cartels are so fucking big</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;re not doing it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a war it&rsquo;s got to be a war</p>
<p>the drug cartels are gigantic now man</p>
<p>i mean look what do i know i&rsquo;m talking on my ass but</p>
<p>the whole situation came</p>
<p>about for sure</p>
<p>because the drugs aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>legal the problem with it being a war</p>
<p>is that the drug cartels are very much in sync with the</p>
<p>power structure</p>
<p>with the government itself</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s all and</p>
<p>the economy</p>
<p>itself apparently</p>
<p>is a lot of</p>
<p>the economy itself is propped up by the drug trade so</p>
<p>so if that&rsquo;s the case then</p>
<p>how do you delegitimize</p>
<p>how do you figure out</p>
<p>a way to make it work do you legalize they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about legalizing drugs in mexico itself</p>
<p>they have to</p>
<p>criminalize</p>
<p>everything in mexico</p>
<p>lsd mushrooms</p>
<p>oh yeah i mean you&rsquo;re not supposed</p>
<p>to sell it but if you have it you don&rsquo;t go to jail</p>
<p>as long as there&rsquo;s a demand</p>
<p>and the risk of</p>
<p>peddling that demand is that high you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have people who are badass</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>willing to do whatever it takes to get that money</p>
<p>scary i mean</p>
<p>we should have learned</p>
<p>about that in this country with prohibition</p>
<p>the 1920s i know you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky that marijuana has the calming</p>
<p>effect that it has</p>
<p>because if it you know if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know that the</p>
<p>whole stoner</p>
<p>culture and everything</p>
<p>behind it if that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve just marveled at the fact that you make alcohol</p>
<p>legal and weed</p>
<p>illegals it&rsquo;s like goes back to that reefer madness</p>
<p>ignorance like</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>out of your fucking mind well it&rsquo;s also an</p>
<p>issue of it&rsquo;s been illegal for so long</p>
<p>if they come out and say there&rsquo;s no reason for it</p>
<p>to have ever been illegal now</p>
<p>and you open up a</p>
<p>whole can of worms you</p>
<p>just brought up</p>
<p>you just brought up the biggest and best argument</p>
<p>for any for a</p>
<p>smaller government whenever you pass a law</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not saying some laws don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to be passed but you got to remember one thing</p>
<p>you pass any kind of law</p>
<p>any kind of</p>
<p>legislation</p>
<p>say what you want</p>
<p>about the obama</p>
<p>health care</p>
<p>thing i don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to make a</p>
<p>stand on it</p>
<p>but just know</p>
<p>that when you have a huge government program</p>
<p>and you pass laws around that program what happens is</p>
<p>a cottage industry grows up around that law</p>
<p>and a lot of people develop an interest</p>
<p>in economic interest</p>
<p>in that and</p>
<p>keeping that law active that&rsquo;s why whenever you</p>
<p>start a government program whenever you</p>
<p>start giving</p>
<p>money to somebody or whatever it</p>
<p>might be it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>and the democrats themselves said pass just something</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never go away and you&rsquo;ll be able to add to it</p>
<p>and that is it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about being</p>
<p>right or left</p>
<p>you better keep that in mind because</p>
<p>george washington himself said</p>
<p>men will invent</p>
<p>laws to take</p>
<p>their own freedom away from themselves</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how people are</p>
<p>you know you want to make the</p>
<p>world a really fucking safe</p>
<p>place you want to legislate</p>
<p>everything i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to live in a country like that fuck you</p>
<p>i want to take my own personal responsibility for</p>
<p>things absolutely</p>
<p>you know and the real problem with these</p>
<p>government you</p>
<p>know when government grows is that it very rarely</p>
<p>shrinks it doesn&rsquo;t shrink</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s expansive it&rsquo;s ever expansive in its coercive</p>
<p>it does two</p>
<p>things it takes</p>
<p>taxes and it passes laws do you need that yes</p>
<p>the question is what is what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about proportion</p>
<p>how much is too much</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>this country</p>
<p>was founded</p>
<p>on the notion that government is a necessary evil</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have it but stop telling me that government</p>
<p>and equalizing the playing</p>
<p>field and socially</p>
<p>engineering equality is what makes this country</p>
<p>great no it&rsquo;s fucking not</p>
<p>i create so much resentment</p>
<p>and whenever you have</p>
<p>social engineering and</p>
<p>you do it for you know like</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>affirmative action is a wonderful idea i</p>
<p>think the idea that you know you want to balance</p>
<p>everything out and give</p>
<p>black people a chance to</p>
<p>but whenever you have it set up for</p>
<p>guys testing</p>
<p>for the fire department or something like that</p>
<p>where a black candidate</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>score as high as a</p>
<p>white candidate it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst thing</p>
<p>that is the</p>
<p>worst thing for any</p>
<p>black person or anybody else</p>
<p>it is assuming and suggesting to a</p>
<p>black person that they can&rsquo;t compete mentally</p>
<p>what does that do to someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>self esteem what does that do to someone&rsquo;s self worth</p>
<p>that is the most</p>
<p>is the most insulting that&rsquo;s the most racist</p>
<p>thing i can</p>
<p>think of in fact</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>did black people need us to</p>
<p>lower the playing</p>
<p>field when it came to</p>
<p>sports and music</p>
<p>look what they</p>
<p>did with jazz look what they&rsquo;ve done with sports</p>
<p>jazz is the highest american art form</p>
<p>expression it&rsquo;s primarily a</p>
<p>black expression</p>
<p>did blacks need government programs for that no they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just as capable i think what</p>
<p>they find out</p>
<p>and they believe they do believe that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>issue that they</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>as much as close to an</p>
<p>equal number of people representative</p>
<p>as they do in society if it&rsquo;s 10</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s close to as they can</p>
<p>but not look for it when it&rsquo;s not the argument</p>
<p>is equality of opportunity</p>
<p>you know we know that</p>
<p>what people</p>
<p>who are in the affirmative action camp and i</p>
<p>understand it they&rsquo;re saying look</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to create an</p>
<p>equal opportunity</p>
<p>for people and i</p>
<p>understand that and you do</p>
<p>it is an uneven playing</p>
<p>field it is</p>
<p>but the question is what do you do</p>
<p>about it and you better be</p>
<p>very careful</p>
<p>when government</p>
<p>comes in with solutions very carefully i</p>
<p>think the best solution if possible is to go in</p>
<p>real early go in and have programs for</p>
<p>kids that are developing in single family households</p>
<p>or single parent households</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not getting any attention and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting any love they&rsquo;re not getting any guidance and</p>
<p>their mom has to work they&rsquo;re doing that in</p>
<p>harlem and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apparently been</p>
<p>very successful god that</p>
<p>would be the</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>guy in harlem who said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to get</p>
<p>these kids before they even get to kindergarten</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the move</p>
<p>and he did and he created a program that followed them</p>
<p>from kindergarten all the way through college and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a harlem</p>
<p>renaissance project that&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been amazing apparently</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what it takes i mean</p>
<p>you start with someone when they&rsquo;re 20 man my god</p>
<p>because if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that and you have</p>
<p>for example let&rsquo;s just take the black</p>
<p>issue if you have a disproportionate number of</p>
<p>black men in jail for example</p>
<p>the problem with that is people</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>their problem you&rsquo;re wasting a huge segment of your</p>
<p>population you&rsquo;re not tapping into incredible</p>
<p>incredible potential</p>
<p>that you could be</p>
<p>and so the question becomes</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right i think you have to get it when</p>
<p>a boy is 14 he&rsquo;s already lost in some ways</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s very hard it&rsquo;s very hard to kind</p>
<p>of figure out how to deal with that damage martial arts</p>
<p>is the best way</p>
<p>yeah whatever</p>
<p>music or whatever discipline</p>
<p>but the thing</p>
<p>about martial arts is you have to</p>
<p>overcome you overcome</p>
<p>great scary</p>
<p>things over and over and over again</p>
<p>and in doing that it develops character and</p>
<p>builds character and you almost</p>
<p>want to make</p>
<p>up for the fact that you know you were fucked</p>
<p>up when you got into this you want to show a big gap</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>josh talk josh</p>
<p>waitskin who is the</p>
<p>chess prodigy</p>
<p>he has a school</p>
<p>he does he has a</p>
<p>school where he</p>
<p>teaches children</p>
<p>math no i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry music</p>
<p>chess and martial arts</p>
<p>and and and</p>
<p>and what he does through</p>
<p>those three</p>
<p>school well</p>
<p>through those</p>
<p>three through</p>
<p>those three venues he</p>
<p>he does he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>teaching you even</p>
<p>that the martial arts</p>
<p>music in a chess is secondary</p>
<p>most importantly is your</p>
<p>learning how to learn</p>
<p>and he always says that he</p>
<p>wrote a book</p>
<p>about that yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great book he</p>
<p>wrote i recommend everybody called the art of</p>
<p>learning he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trained with</p>
<p>my friend nathan</p>
<p>and my friend nathan got me in contact with him</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve exchanged</p>
<p>emails back and forth</p>
<p>and i wanna</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>guy to meet</p>
<p>him and train with him</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>new york i want to get him on the podcast too if i</p>
<p>can i met him</p>
<p>i met him in</p>
<p>new york i had</p>
<p>lunch with him and the people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy</p>
<p>who came up with i mean it</p>
<p>would rather excuse me</p>
<p>the movie searching for</p>
<p>bobby fisher was</p>
<p>based on his life him as a</p>
<p>child chess prodigy</p>
<p>and he went from that to</p>
<p>going into kung fu</p>
<p>he became a</p>
<p>two time two</p>
<p>time two time</p>
<p>push hands kung</p>
<p>fu chamber which is</p>
<p>heavy stuff they do it throws and</p>
<p>and he was the</p>
<p>first westerner in</p>
<p>china to win it</p>
<p>twice two times in a row and now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to for the</p>
<p>mondials i guess yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fiend with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu now he</p>
<p>trains with</p>
<p>marcella garcia and he</p>
<p>he developed this website called</p>
<p>mg in action</p>
<p>mginaction com mg being</p>
<p>marcella garcia i believe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the url</p>
<p>check it marcia garcia</p>
<p>or marcella</p>
<p>garcia in action if you want to look at it if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>jiu jitsu fan and</p>
<p>what the website is is he&rsquo;s broken down</p>
<p>jiu jitsu moves</p>
<p>just and study them the way he</p>
<p>would do chess because</p>
<p>chess is so disciplined</p>
<p>just so we&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>trumpet i mean</p>
<p>chess players</p>
<p>practice constantly</p>
<p>and they go over moves and they go over</p>
<p>strategies and</p>
<p>they have maps out in</p>
<p>their head well what</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s done is put all that same discipline to</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and so he has marcel</p>
<p>garcia&rsquo;s entire repertoire</p>
<p>of techniques and</p>
<p>all sorts of different sweeps and</p>
<p>arm bars and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things and in</p>
<p>chains and how they go and he</p>
<p>has like this website we can just sign up and you can</p>
<p>learn i mean</p>
<p>basically like you and your friends</p>
<p>you know if you wanted to you</p>
<p>could sign up for it get an internet</p>
<p>connection get a laptop</p>
<p>and have like a mat in your living room</p>
<p>and you and your</p>
<p>buddy could</p>
<p>learn jiu jitsu from</p>
<p>this website that&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s fucking amazing man</p>
<p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s amazing and</p>
<p>for people that</p>
<p>studied jujutsu it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>too because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go over the finer nuances of</p>
<p>a technique like fuck that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve been doing wrong</p>
<p>because a lot of jujutsu is</p>
<p>leverage and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>most of it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about strength it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about being in the proper position and much</p>
<p>smaller people can</p>
<p>defeat much larger people because of the technique</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like little</p>
<p>subtle things that technique sometimes you miss</p>
<p>and so these</p>
<p>videos are like</p>
<p>real masters like</p>
<p>marcella garcia this is like a</p>
<p>marcella garcia i</p>
<p>asked josh i was like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it like to roll with them do you ever get them you ever</p>
<p>catch them and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no i never get him no he&rsquo;s on another level man</p>
<p>he moves so fast</p>
<p>is that what it is he&rsquo;s so good</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so sharp</p>
<p>you know so sharp</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have any room for error</p>
<p>so with a lot of</p>
<p>jiu jitsu it&rsquo;s like how much room for</p>
<p>error are you</p>
<p>gonna give me</p>
<p>are you gonna</p>
<p>leave openings for</p>
<p>underhooks are you</p>
<p>gonna slip to your back are you</p>
<p>going to let me</p>
<p>sweep you are you</p>
<p>gonna give up</p>
<p>cause you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna fight anymore</p>
<p>and go to your back and try to get me in your guard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s like a little battle</p>
<p>going on like</p>
<p>how much do you have left in the tank</p>
<p>well when you get to a</p>
<p>level like marcella garcia</p>
<p>instead of all that nonsense in your</p>
<p>brain it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>super tuned</p>
<p>killing machine that moves so fast you can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>literally he&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>thinking about his movements he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drilled them to the</p>
<p>point where they&rsquo;re so pinpoint and precise</p>
<p>he has the idea of getting to your</p>
<p>back and then before you know it his hooks are in well</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got his</p>
<p>arm across your neck it&rsquo;s happened in military</p>
<p>josh waits can cause that</p>
<p>chunking where</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s seen so much that he can</p>
<p>start thinking in</p>
<p>chunks like</p>
<p>he can think in</p>
<p>systems and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking move to move and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking in a</p>
<p>system like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking in</p>
<p>literally like six move chunks</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>watching you and can</p>
<p>already predict what you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>and because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been doing it so long he gets into your mind</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s watching you</p>
<p>like do these clunky</p>
<p>here i come</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna do this and he goes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen that i&rsquo;ve seen that a thousand times and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this but i&rsquo;m already</p>
<p>gonna do this</p>
<p>after that and so</p>
<p>so advanced it&rsquo;s like josh says when he would play</p>
<p>chess with guys who</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t as advanced</p>
<p>as he he&rsquo;s seeing the</p>
<p>whole board</p>
<p>and the reason he&rsquo;s seeing six or</p>
<p>seven moves</p>
<p>ahead of time is because he&rsquo;s able to</p>
<p>chunk he&rsquo;s chunking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s seeing</p>
<p>things in in</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s what he called it he just called it like</p>
<p>five move six move</p>
<p>blocks of time that&rsquo;s one of the things about eddie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>style or the way eddie teaches</p>
<p>eddie teaches instead of just</p>
<p>teaching a move</p>
<p>teaches a whole</p>
<p>chain of moves</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;ll teach a certain pass</p>
<p>to get to a</p>
<p>certain position and then to there and then always to</p>
<p>a finish wow but it&rsquo;s like four five moves in advance</p>
<p>and sometimes there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s alternate</p>
<p>endings or alternate</p>
<p>branches yeah like what happens if you lose this arm</p>
<p>now you got</p>
<p>to go to this and then you know so in your mind</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rolling and you get to certain specific areas</p>
<p>you have this already</p>
<p>map he&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>mapped it out for you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the way he</p>
<p>teaches wow</p>
<p>yeah i think it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>smart way to do it too</p>
<p>i do that with my</p>
<p>love making</p>
<p>love making</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t love making tell me more</p>
<p>you hear that echo</p>
<p>dude you&rsquo;re channeling craig shoemaker</p>
