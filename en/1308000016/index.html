    <p>You gotta rise up before you begin You gotta dive in before you can swim</p>
<p>You gotta give it all to win We&rsquo;re going all in</p>
<p>Hey everybody, welcome back. Besties are back for the all-in podcast.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa, Freeburg is here, the dictator Chamath, and of course,</p>
<p>rain man David Sachs. And it&rsquo;s been a big week here in Silicon Valley with Airbnb</p>
<p>and Wish both going public for over a hundred billion dollars combined.</p>
<p>Anybody get their beak wet on that one? Oh, hey guys.</p>
<p>How are you David? I might have gotten my beak wet on a couple of those, so.</p>
<p>Oh, a little beak wet, huh? Well, you know what, in celebration of your recent victory</p>
<p>with Airbnb and Wish, I will, oh no, I can&rsquo;t zoom in on my merch, but I&rsquo;ve got my unofficial</p>
<p>wet your beak mug. So for those of you wondering, we have to get a little bit of housekeeping out</p>
<p>of the way at first here. The merch has gone crazy. Have you guys been watching merch on Twitter?</p>
<p>Of course. Anybody got favorite merch or thoughts?</p>
<p>I got some of those mugs. I think they arrived today. They look great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing. And the best decision we made was not to let you sell t-shirts, Jason, because</p>
<p>you would have milked this for every nickel you could. And instead, we open sourced it to the</p>
<p>fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it. I mean, they&rsquo;re literally-</p>
<p>I know that hurt you. I know that hurt you a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, the problem I&rsquo;m having here, no advertising. I&rsquo;m picking up all the production</p>
<p>cost here. I&rsquo;m sending you guys equipment. You maniacs lose the equipment every time. You go</p>
<p>from one of your estates to another estate. I&rsquo;m sending equipment to four different places.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ve got a special, very special episode for you today. We are doing,</p>
<p>drum roll please, we&rsquo;re going to add some sound effects to this afterwards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do the Bestie Awards today. So we&rsquo;re going to go through the biggest winners</p>
<p>in politics and business and cultures. And of course, the losers, the flashes in the pan,</p>
<p>the best business moves, the stupidest business moves. We&rsquo;ve got a lot to get through.</p>
<p>But just in terms of housekeeping, again, the all-in syndicate is up and running. I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 4,000 people who have applied in 10 days. Let&rsquo;s just talk about the market cap of Airbnb,</p>
<p>or Wish for that matter. What round did you invest in Airbnb?</p>
<p>Series C.</p>
<p>Was that the Founder&rsquo;s Fund round?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And congrats.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so yummy. But to be honest, that was already over a billion-dollar valuation, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was. It was.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still an 80 or 100X, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 40X, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 40X or something like that. So thank you, Brian Chesky. Thank you, Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>Peter led that round. And Brian was looking to include founders in the round, in addition to</p>
<p>it being led by Founder&rsquo;s Fund. And so Peter introduced me, and that&rsquo;s how it happened.</p>
<p>Wow, fantastic. I did not get my big wet on that. But I did mention Airbnb on my podcast. And I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been trying to get Brian on the podcast for, I don&rsquo;t know, a decade. And I said, I know you guys</p>
<p>want to have him on the pod. I&rsquo;ve asked him literally every year for 10 years, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he likes me. And then he emailed me and said, I listened to the podcast. I like you.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, okay, great. Will you come on? He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll come on. So he&rsquo;s going to come</p>
<p>on this year, I think, which will be great for this week in startups.</p>
<p>I think Brian and the whole team really did a masterful job of navigating through the whole</p>
<p>COVID crisis. I mean, everybody forgets how negative the publicity was. People were talking</p>
<p>about Airbnb as COVID roadkill back in April. I tweeted a CNBC headline from back in April,</p>
<p>wondering whether Airbnb was even going to survive. And they navigated the crisis,</p>
<p>they did have to cut headcount, but they made the company much more profitable.</p>
<p>But they also did great things for both the renters and the host. At the company&rsquo;s expense,</p>
<p>they refunded something like $250 million to users who had canceled reservations, but they gave</p>
<p>the money to the host to keep them afloat. So they really did a great job navigating this whole</p>
<p>crisis. It&rsquo;s a pretty great company. He obviously cares deeply. It was very hard, I think, for him</p>
<p>to cut all that staff at that time. It was kind of a tough decision. But they were very generous</p>
<p>in how they did it. Yeah. So congratulations on getting the beak wet, Sax. And Chamath,</p>
<p>I got a bunch of inbound. You had filed to sell some shares of Virgin Galactic. I saw you tweeted</p>
<p>about it and you wanted to be transparent. People asked for you to address it upfront on the show.</p>
<p>So go ahead. Yeah, I have a lot of projects that I intend to fund in 2021. I&rsquo;m probably going to put</p>
<p>another, I don&rsquo;t know, I think the forecast was almost $2 billion to work. And I needed to manage</p>
<p>my liquidity for this year and make sure that I could continue to make all those investments and</p>
<p>fund all of the other things that I need to do. And that&rsquo;s why I did it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still a significant shareholder, I assume, and you believe in the company.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I remain completely committed to that business. It would have been better if I</p>
<p>could have sold something else, but it&rsquo;s not quite possible. And when you leave the tax year,</p>
<p>you just have to make these decisions to lock in some gains against other losses and would have</p>
<p>loved to have not had to do it, but I needed to manage my liquidity. And so I sold, it&rsquo;s a small</p>
<p>portion of what I own. Yeah, that was sort of my point. This is a small portion of what you own.</p>
<p>And I mean, this is something that in poker and in business, you got to manage your chip stack and</p>
<p>you got to manage your bankroll. So today we&rsquo;re going to do the besties. This is our first attempt</p>
<p>at talking about, it&rsquo;s our award show for 2020. Let&rsquo;s leave it at that. Let&rsquo;s start out with</p>
<p>the biggest winner. Hold on, hold on a second. How much weight did you lose? Because it&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re still fat and you have a way where it&rsquo;s either you&rsquo;re still fat and you have an</p>
<p>incredible camera or you&rsquo;ve actually lost weight. And this reminds me, by the way,</p>
<p>I would like to tell a story. No, no, no, no. Four years ago. Oh my God. Jason, Jason and I</p>
<p>make a weight bet. Okay. Just don&rsquo;t say the dollar amount. It was like, no, it was like,</p>
<p>I think it was like a $10,000 a pound. And Jason, Jason, he would get 10th. He was about to do,</p>
<p>and this is incredible. Jason comes to us five years ago and says, guys, you won&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a show on NBC, a reality TV show. That&rsquo;s true. A pilot. And with beep. Please beep</p>
<p>that out. Okay. Beep that up. Beep that out so I don&rsquo;t get canceled. I thought, oh my God,</p>
<p>that guy, that guy seems like a train wreck, but okay, that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re going to do this</p>
<p>pilot with beep, beep. And NBC. And NBC. And don&rsquo;t you need to be in fighting shape? And he said,</p>
<p>yes, I need motivation. So I said, here&rsquo;s motivation. Let&rsquo;s make a weight bet. You need</p>
<p>to be under 190 pounds. And I&rsquo;ll pay you 10,000 $10,000 a pound that you&rsquo;re underneath. You pay</p>
<p>whatever it was a pound over. Yeah. It was like six months later. And we&rsquo;re hosting I&rsquo;m hosting</p>
<p>a poker game. And I realized, oh my God, this is the last. This is the last day of the bet.</p>
<p>The day before, we started the day before. And then the last day of the bet is midnight.</p>
<p>I wait till midnight and I jump up and I&rsquo;m like, wait, Ben.</p>
<p>And so I say, Jason, you got to be under 190, 192.5 or 193 pounds. He literally goes ash and</p>
<p>white. And he says more white than I am now. Cause I just ate and I was maintaining my weight.</p>
<p>He says, he says, okay, okay. That&rsquo;s fine. And he had been eating pizza,</p>
<p>a brick. He ate a brick of breed. I swear to God. And then he says, he says,</p>
<p>Freeberg, you won&rsquo;t believe this. He goes, guys, I just need five minutes before the weigh-in</p>
<p>and then he goes to our guest bedroom. And that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>13 in this story. He tried, he tried, he tried to shut out five pounds, which I took a leak.</p>
<p>Who can do that after, after eating all that pizza and cheese and nachos and everything.</p>
<p>Anyways, he loses the weight bet and he says, Jamal, this is completely unfair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pay you. He was like 196 pounds. I&rsquo;m not paying you this money.</p>
<p>One pound over.</p>
<p>And he said, uh, this bet is not over until midnight. The fall, obviously.</p>
<p>Yes, obviously. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>24 hours later.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>So I said, all right, fine, Jake, I&rsquo;ll fine. He goes home. He literally takes every diuretic</p>
<p>known to man. It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>And then he loses, he doesn&rsquo;t eat the whole thing.</p>
<p>I did go for a walk in two pairs of sweatpants and sweated it out.</p>
<p>I checked in with this guy 10 times this day. He walked like 12 miles. He took four shits.</p>
<p>You know, he just can&rsquo;t be diuretic.</p>
<p>I sweated it out. Steam room, hot bath.</p>
<p>Saxon.</p>
<p>He did a colonoscopy.</p>
<p>He did a colonoscopy. To his credit, he lost five pounds by midnight and he won the bet.</p>
<p>I did drop it. But then I said, you know what? Because there were two different weigh-ins,</p>
<p>we were going to go play in a poker tournament. So we went and played in the poker tournament.</p>
<p>I said, Jamal, buy me into the poker tournament. Whatever we win, we&rsquo;ll chop it up if it happens.</p>
<p>So we just made it into a friendly thing.</p>
<p>And obviously-</p>
<p>But great. Now that story is out there. And now everybody&rsquo;s going to be on Twitter</p>
<p>with the code, their t-shirt.</p>
<p>I hope somebody in the All In Army does the t-shirt that just says 192.5 and we&rsquo;ll all</p>
<p>know what it means, which is the weight that-</p>
<p>The 190, it was 193.</p>
<p>193.</p>
<p>Which is crazy that it was 193. Anyway, here we go. Getting into the categories.</p>
<p>Our first category is the biggest winner in politics. Biggest winner in politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask you gentlemen to raise your hand. If you have a strong feeling on this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call on one of you. Who&rsquo;s got a big winner in politics? Go ahead, Shamath.</p>
<p>Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Joe Biden. Okay, going out on a limb there. Joe Biden.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s be honest, there&rsquo;s nobody bigger. And actually, if you wanted to abstract it,</p>
<p>what I would say is centrism was the big winner. And it kind of feeds the losers,</p>
<p>which is sort of the extreme left and the extreme right. But I would say that</p>
<p>centrism and Joe Biden were the huge, huge, huge winners.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll give an orthodox pick, which is Xi Jinping, the chairman of the Chinese Communist</p>
<p>Party. You would have thought he would have had a bad year starting off with COVID starting in</p>
<p>his country at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The Wuhan virus?</p>
<p>A global plague came from China, but they were able to use a very gullible WHO to launder</p>
<p>responsibility for the catastrophe. And they took advantage of the crisis to build more client</p>
<p>states in Asia and Africa with promises of vaccines and money. And finally, his biggest</p>
<p>global nemesis, Trump, and then Pompeo lost in the election. So you have to say he came out on top</p>
<p>at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Free bird?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have the exact same answer as Sax. I put the Chinese Communist Party as a whole,</p>
<p>actually. And I feel like on the world stage, they&rsquo;re strengthened in the post COVID world.</p>
<p>I had Kamala because she went from the famous quote in the debates,</p>
<p>there was a little girl in California who was bused to school, that little girl was me,</p>
<p>where she took on Joe Biden. And then she winds up getting the VP slot. And I think</p>
<p>she winds up actually becoming president and will be the first female president of the year</p>
<p>in the history of the United States. And that could happen in the first term. Or if Joe Biden</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t run for a second term, and they do a halfway decent job, Kamala plus Pete Buttigieg</p>
<p>is a pretty great ticket as well. Who&rsquo;s the biggest loser? Who&rsquo;s your biggest loser, Chamath?</p>
<p>In politics.</p>
<p>Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p>And the extreme left and the extreme right.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with that. But I&rsquo;d also add Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House. Her impeachment</p>
<p>of Trump at the beginning of the year went absolutely nowhere. It wasn&rsquo;t even an issue</p>
<p>in the election. And her majority in the House has almost completely disappeared. She lost a</p>
<p>dozen seats. I think she&rsquo;s down to about four or five seats as a razor thin majority in the House.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s set to lose more in the midterm elections. I predict that she is set to not</p>
<p>be Speaker anymore in two years and headed for retirement.</p>
<p>Okay, Freeberg, you got one? Biggest loser?</p>
<p>I have I have the institution of American democracy is the biggest loser of 2020.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re coming out of this year with like, no belief that our election was valid</p>
<p>for a vast majority for a sizable minority of this country that that the whole system.</p>
<p>Some Democrats believe that the election was fraudulent now, too.</p>
<p>I mean, if you say something enough times, everyone believes it. So,</p>
<p>you know, here we are coming out of this year. We&rsquo;re with a crippling lack of faith in our</p>
<p>electoral system. And it&rsquo;s scary that American democracy is being fundamentally questioned by</p>
<p>its own constituents. So so I think that&rsquo;s the biggest loser. I had I had two choices here. One</p>
<p>of them was already said, I said the hysterical left as my runner up, Bernie and Warren, just</p>
<p>dismissed by Biden and Kamala. They they are not even part of the discussion anymore,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t even get cabinet positions. So the hysterical left and the socialist</p>
<p>Communist Party is out of the Democratic Party, thank the Lord. But my biggest loser,</p>
<p>I have to say that this is the worst run of any politician I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a year,</p>
<p>which is Rudy Giuliani under investigation for Les Parnas and Igor Fruman. Then the bogus lawsuit</p>
<p>elections, then farting during a hearing, then doing the Barat shirt tuck. I don&rsquo;t know if we</p>
<p>have feelings on if that was a tuck or if he was trying to wake up the genie. And then he bleeds</p>
<p>hair dye. Then he starts bleeding hair dye. Wake up the genie. He got covered. No, he got covered.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s in the hospital with COVID. I mean, just think if you think you had a shitty year.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be the fans of the show are now registering domain names of things we say.</p>
<p>The upside for him is that Donald Trump&rsquo;s campaign is paying him $20,000 a day in legal fees.</p>
<p>No, I think it was 200. No, it&rsquo;s 20 grand a day. Oh, it&rsquo;s only 20.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his going rate for making a fool of himself.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that rate was adjusted when Rudy couldn&rsquo;t get the case to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Well, we all know that Trump pays his bills on time, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, right?</p>
<p>All right. Now we&rsquo;re going to have some more fun. Biggest winner in business,</p>
<p>biggest winner in business. Freeberg, you want to lead us off? You haven&rsquo;t let us off yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take this one. I think that the biggest winner in business this year is a company that</p>
<p>started a few years ago called Moderna. This company had an IPO in December of 18 at $7.5</p>
<p>billion market cap. It traded between $4 and $5 billion throughout 2019. And all of a sudden,</p>
<p>COVID hits, and this becomes a vaccine candidate driver for Moderna, and the stock shoots up. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth $60 billion today. This company has not had a product that&rsquo;s gone to market prior to COVID,</p>
<p>and they struggled getting this business. I wouldn&rsquo;t say struggle, but they never really had</p>
<p>an application for their mRNA technology. They looked at it for years, iterating and pivoting</p>
<p>this business, and COVID, like a lot of other businesses, really gave them an unbelievable</p>
<p>kick. What might you say, a shot in the arm?</p>
<p>A shot in the arm. And tonight, they got approval from the FDA, and they&rsquo;re going to be shipping</p>
<p>starting on Monday, I think. Sax, who you got for the biggest winner in business? We&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>at a good pace here. Elon Musk, our friend, rose to become the second richest man in the world,</p>
<p>ahead of Bill Gates, and right on the heels of Jeff Bezos. His company, Tesla, had something like</p>
<p>an eight or 10x gain, so over a $500 billion company. Of course, the products are awesome.</p>
<p>It joined the S&amp;P 500, and SpaceX is doing amazing as well. We saw the launch of Starship the other</p>
<p>day, and I have just been mesmerized by all these unboxing videos for Starlink, which you can see on</p>
<p>YouTube. And it is just magic that you can unbox this little satellite dish, plug it in, and you</p>
<p>have broadband internet from space. So I think Elon seems to be on track to be not only the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s richest man, but the world&rsquo;s first trillionaire. Wow. Big ups there to E. Chamath,</p>
<p>what do you got for the biggest winner in business of 2020?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to agree with Saxipu. Elon basically has had, over the last 10 or 15 years,</p>
<p>an incredible amount of challenges that he&rsquo;s overcome. He&rsquo;s had an incredible amount of</p>
<p>haters. He&rsquo;s probably had to deal with stuff that most of us would have broken under,</p>
<p>and he just fought through it. And the guy just basically</p>
<p>bended all the haters until he crushed their souls. And I just think that that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk is the, hands down, the biggest, biggest, most obvious winner of 2020.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the obvious winner. I&rsquo;ll give a couple of runner-ups here. I thought also on the runner-ups</p>
<p>after Elon, Zoom beating Skype, Slack video, Google Hangouts, and fixing all their China</p>
<p>issues and getting to $100 billion valuation is notable. Obviously, Amazon did a great job</p>
<p>because of the pandemic. And then just as an oddball out there, I just thought Adam Silver</p>
<p>and the NBA bubble was an incredibly bold project that was executed so well and was such a delightful</p>
<p>business moment and also a cultural moment that you had the NBA shutting down during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Remember that dramatic night on a Thursday night, and they canceled the games, and then they do the</p>
<p>bubble and it works. And that gave me hope that we could get through the virus. So those were some of</p>
<p>my other runners-up. All right, the biggest loser in business in 2020. Go ahead, Shamath.</p>
<p>Facebook and Google exiting the year with umpteen antitrust lawsuits. I think morale must be</p>
<p>pretty brutal over there. There&rsquo;s no amount of money at some point that people are willing to</p>
<p>get paid to walk in the door every day and just have to deal with those kinds of accusations. And</p>
<p>so for all the good in the world that they do, so it just must be really tough that they have</p>
<p>to deal with it. But those guys, I think, are the biggest losers in business.</p>
<p>Who do you got, Sax?</p>
<p>The small business person. Whether it&rsquo;s restaurants, retail, hospitality, what have you,</p>
<p>small business people really took it on the chin this year. I agree with Shamath about companies</p>
<p>like Google and Facebook losing esteem in the eyes of the public for good reason, censorship,</p>
<p>and so on. But tech still are, you know, stocks are at all-time highs. The politicians got to</p>
<p>keep eating at French Laundry, but it was the small business people who got absolutely decimated</p>
<p>by these lockdowns, which don&rsquo;t even work. And so they are the big loser of 2020 in business.</p>
<p>Freeberg, who you got?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little more vanilla than the rest of you guys. I went with AMC Entertainment Holdings.</p>
<p>Talk about a fucked business in COVID. Restaurants, at least, you can do takeout.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take out a movie from AMC. They&rsquo;re shut down all over the country. Their creditors are</p>
<p>telling them to declare bankruptcy. It&rsquo;s a total shit show. No one&rsquo;s going to go back to the movie</p>
<p>theaters.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think they go back?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they go. I don&rsquo;t know what the hell AMC is going to do. What do you do with</p>
<p>all those theaters? They&rsquo;re awesome. I love going to the movies, but I&rsquo;m not going to the movies</p>
<p>for at least another year. And it&rsquo;s sad because, honestly, movies are a big part of my life,</p>
<p>always have been. And it&rsquo;s sad to see movie theaters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to come back stronger. I think Amazon will buy one chain. I think Netflix</p>
<p>buys the other. And then with your membership, you get to go and see all the range of stuff,</p>
<p>and maybe even see like Queen&rsquo;s Gambit in the theater.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a great experience, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. I would have loved to see Queen&rsquo;s Gambit in a theater.</p>
<p>Totally. There&rsquo;s so much you could do with theaters. And I think there&rsquo;s an opportunity.</p>
<p>But man, did those guys get screwed this year?</p>
<p>Well, I always thought they should do an extended edition. So imagine if when HBO</p>
<p>or one of those did Game of Thrones, if they had it out the day before in movie theaters,</p>
<p>or the week before, or two days before, and they did it in an extra 10 minutes,</p>
<p>people would love that. My biggest loser was, of course, same as David,</p>
<p>real world businesses absolutely demolished. And the government, after that first stimulus,</p>
<p>which was incredible, Trump did an amazing job of just dropping buckets of money, whether it was</p>
<p>that PPE loans, and PPE loans, whatever, the PPP loans, PPP loans. All this stuff was incredible.</p>
<p>And then what complete utter bullshit and incompetence from our government that they</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get the second one done. It&rsquo;s absolutely fucking infuriating that the Democrats and the</p>
<p>Republicans, these selfish fuckers, couldn&rsquo;t get another billion dollars dropped. And here we are</p>
<p>in December, that shit needed to drop in August or September, not December. It&rsquo;s just absolutely</p>
<p>disgraceful. I&rsquo;m just disgusted that they couldn&rsquo;t even get some more money to people who are</p>
<p>suffering unemployment and these restaurants, 100,000 restaurant closures by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just unconscionable that the stock market is ripping and we can&rsquo;t get just some money in</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s pockets, just drop the money. It&rsquo;s infuriating. I was sitting here at the taping of</p>
<p>this that it might actually happen. Okay, biggest winner in culture. Who&rsquo;s got a big winner in</p>
<p>culture? Anybody got one? I got the Black Lives Matter movement. And I think it was such a</p>
<p>meaningful and impactful kind of shift in how people were thinking fundamentally about behavior</p>
<p>in society. It&rsquo;s still persisting. You know, there&rsquo;s corporate action, there&rsquo;s state action,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s regulatory action. And I think it&rsquo;s a meaningful movement that&rsquo;s going to persist.</p>
<p>I think it came at a time when we all felt like, you know, a lot of people felt locked up in their</p>
<p>homes, people were angry, people were frustrated with the system. And it just was a very</p>
<p>poignant moment, especially occurring during COVID that it really took hold. And I think it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to last. And I think that the movement itself is going to spawn a lot of change.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s well said. David, who do you got in culture?</p>
<p>Baby Yoda. So you went pop culture on that one.</p>
<p>Yeah. Star of the Mandalorian show, his ascent to icon status helped Disney get 86 million</p>
<p>subscribers for Disney Plus, which just blew expectations and has established Disney Plus</p>
<p>as the main rival to Netflix. Do you think Netflix, you think</p>
<p>Disney will pass Netflix, correct? I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ll pass them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re now certainly going to be a major rival to them.</p>
<p>I think they passed them. Okay, Chamath, who do you got?</p>
<p>I would pick a combination of Fortnite, Roblox, and Among Me, which I think has for</p>
<p>at least a lot of high school and middle school kids, but maybe a lot of adults,</p>
<p>the only form of social interaction that we&rsquo;ve had for an entire year.</p>
<p>Wow. What a great selection. And I think it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>how much lonelier we all would have been and how much more mental illness and depression we all</p>
<p>would have dealt with if we couldn&rsquo;t have even just talked to our friends. And I think that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something really beautiful that those games did for people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one. That&rsquo;s a good one. I went with podcasting. I think on a cultural basis,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan and what&rsquo;s happening in podcasting is long-forming discussions. Even this podcast</p>
<p>has become just an amazing, amazing movement, and people are having better discussions. And</p>
<p>I consider it the antidote to what&rsquo;s happening on social media. When people hear us discussing</p>
<p>stuff on this podcast, they feel like they ate something nutritious. They had a great salad.</p>
<p>They had some healthy food. And then when they&rsquo;re on social media and they consume the same tweets</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing, they feel like it&rsquo;s junk food. And so I think that podcasting, long-form</p>
<p>discussions, listening to each other, maybe Republicans and Democrats, left, right, everybody</p>
<p>listening to each other, and podcasting is just such a great medium for discussion.</p>
<p>Who is the biggest loser on a cultural basis in 2020, Mr. David Sachs?</p>
<p>The media, starting with the New York Times and other sort of elite media. They ripped the umpire</p>
<p>jersey off their backs to go after Trump. Well, they got him, but at what cost? Half the country</p>
<p>will never trust them again. This makes conspiracy theories more likely. It makes</p>
<p>cultural divides deeper. And they&rsquo;ve been revealed to be corporate journalists, journalists who</p>
<p>subscribe to and serve an agenda of their corporate masters. They&rsquo;ve lost the public&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what do you got on the biggest cultural loser?</p>
<p>Climate change. It took a backseat this year. It had momentum. As a cultural meme, it&rsquo;s lost its</p>
<p>luster. And it&rsquo;s been shadowed a little bit this year with BLM and COVID and lack of faith in</p>
<p>institutions and all the other stuff that&rsquo;s been going on. Do you think that people now,</p>
<p>when they see the collective response to COVID and the vaccines and our ability with science</p>
<p>and technology to solve the pandemic, we will have a newfound appreciation for coordinated</p>
<p>global action on global warming, David? Are you asking me? I think the faith in institutions has</p>
<p>eroded tremendously this year, the WHO, telling people not to wear masks, and then telling them,</p>
<p>hey, masks are good. That hits the warming movement as well. Yeah, I think the lack of</p>
<p>faith in institutions as well as in the media, makes it really difficult for things that require</p>
<p>a coordinated effort and a coordinated cultural shift to take hold, are really challenged in this</p>
<p>new kind of model where you don&rsquo;t know what to believe, and you don&rsquo;t believe institutions,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t believe old school, and you don&rsquo;t believe states, and you don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>anything structural anymore. So it&rsquo;s a scary kind of moment. I don&rsquo;t know. I think climate</p>
<p>change is going to have momentum with the new administration at least coming into office in</p>
<p>the US. But, but generally, like institutional guidance is lost. It&rsquo;s luster. Chamath, what do</p>
<p>you got?</p>
<p>Wokeness, culture, wokeness. And I, I think when you now look at the realization of what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gone through, people have realized that, you know, you can, you can be extremely anti racist</p>
<p>and think Latinx is just a stupid label. You know, you can be an entirely complete 100,000</p>
<p>million percent supporter of LGBTQ, but think that, you know, all these complicated pronouns</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t really necessary. And I think that people are coming to a point where you can have nuance.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s really important. I think that this whole cancel culture and wokeness was</p>
<p>incredibly corrosive. And I think that that they lost.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually a great I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s a great point you&rsquo;re making Chamath</p>
<p>because on the last episode, I fumbled the word MX, which none of us. We all laughed about it.</p>
<p>And then I just had this little thing. I was like, okay, I guess this is when I get cancelled</p>
<p>because I laughed at the fact that or I mispronounced it, right. And the fact that I</p>
<p>thought even for a second, that mispronouncing this term MX, which I then did research on,</p>
<p>and I said, Does anybody know how to pronounce MX on Twitter? So I figured I would preempt the</p>
<p>dropping of the podcast by bringing it up on my Twitter. And people are like, Are you trolling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, No, I&rsquo;m asking. And I found videos. And it turns out, there is an actual controversy</p>
<p>in the trans community, where MX, some people believe means mixed. Am I XED? Other people</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s MX as x, the variable as in the variable x. And so they&rsquo;re having their own</p>
<p>debate. They&rsquo;re figuring it out. That&rsquo;s great. Everybody loves them. Everybody supports them.</p>
<p>But the fact that I mispronounce it, you know, should I be</p>
<p>with that? Yeah. Well, Jason, can I tell you can I tell those people that are struggling with whether</p>
<p>x equals anything or x equals mixed? Just to touch upon Friedberg&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>the human race has caused 8% of all the species in the world to go extinct. And we have put another</p>
<p>22% of every single other species at the brink of extinction. At the same time, we have now</p>
<p>expanded our footprint to touch 75% of the Earth&rsquo;s land surface. So until somebody fixes</p>
<p>those problems, I don&rsquo;t actually want to know what the x stands for. Yeah, I mean, we were</p>
<p>this idea that we&rsquo;re going to cancel until we put stimulus checks. Put the fucking stimulus</p>
<p>checks into people&rsquo;s hands, get these small businesses back to work, then you can tell me</p>
<p>what the x stands for. Yeah. Okay. My biggest loser on culture was the same exact as you,</p>
<p>David, we&rsquo;re thinking similar. I have taken the red pill you gave me. I crushed it up. I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>snorting the red pill like crazy. People think I&rsquo;m turning into a Republican. But I thought</p>
<p>mainstream media and late-stage journalism sacrificed objectivity specifically to get</p>
<p>subscriptions. And they used the anti-Trump feelings. And they worked them and got the ratings</p>
<p>from them. And they literally used that. New York Times is the best example. I think the work you</p>
<p>guys use for best example is canonical of using their anti-Trump feelings to get people to take</p>
<p>out their wallets and subscribe. Everybody realizes it. They drove out Bari Weiss. They</p>
<p>drove out their editor of the page for making people feel unsafe with their words. And then</p>
<p>New York Magazine drove out Andrew Sullivan. And then Glenn Greenwald leaves his publication. I</p>
<p>mean, anybody who descends inside of one of these publications, they cancel them inside of a</p>
<p>publication for an opinion on an opinion page. It&rsquo;s crazy. Okay, let&rsquo;s keep everything moving</p>
<p>here. I guess this is biggest turnaround anything, but I did business. I&rsquo;ll lead off with</p>
<p>mine. My best turnaround was Airbnb. They laid off 25% of the company in July, 1,900 of 7,500</p>
<p>employees. They cut their marketing budget by 800 million. And then they IPO five months later.</p>
<p>And they had raised a billion dollars at an $18 billion valuation, according to PitchBook,</p>
<p>and now worth $88 billion a week after the IPO. That is a turnaround of all turnarounds. David,</p>
<p>who did you have? This is where I had Joe Biden. He finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>No candidate has ever bombed that badly in the first two contests and gone on to win the</p>
<p>nomination. Biden roared back in South Carolina and then won big on Super Tuesday and wrapped up</p>
<p>the party nomination by March. Biggest political comeback ever. Who do you got Freeberg?</p>
<p>I got Airbnb as well. I mean, from Yeah. And here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s one of the craziest stats.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting there in q1 with a great business revenue drops 67% in q2. Can you just imagine the</p>
<p>experience of 67% of your revenue going away in one quarter, cash burn skyrockets and just having</p>
<p>to respond quickly and still maintain integrity with your customers and your employees as a</p>
<p>leadership team. I mean, it was an incredible leadership demonstration. It&rsquo;s a five alarm fire,</p>
<p>right? I mean, it&rsquo;s literally you got to get everybody out of the building. Here we go.</p>
<p>I agree with that. I agree with that. Who do you got Chamath? I&rsquo;m curious. Who is your</p>
<p>biggest, biggest censorship, censor censorship, censorship existed in in draconian and the dark</p>
<p>ages of our of our journey as a country and in the world and it came roaring back this year.</p>
<p>The amount of people that have been muzzled, stifled the amount of fact and science that</p>
<p>literally just gets judged willy nilly by our distribution points like Facebook and Twitter</p>
<p>and medium. It&rsquo;s really scary. So censorship made a roaring comeback in 2020. I like it. I</p>
<p>like it a lot. Okay, now we go on to the biggest flash in the pan. You can interpret this any way</p>
<p>you like. What do you got sexy poo? Rain the who the who nobody knew who the dub the World</p>
<p>Health Organization. Nobody knew what the who was before this year. Then they have become,</p>
<p>you know, somehow this global authority on COVID despite getting everything wrong.</p>
<p>They initially said that we didn&rsquo;t need to wear masks. They didn&rsquo;t update that until June 5. This</p>
<p>was about 10 weeks after my blog saying that, you know, masks were a good idea. They got the method</p>
<p>of transmission wrong. They were saying that transmission mainly occurred through fomites,</p>
<p>which is contagious surfaces instead of respiratory particles. They initially said</p>
<p>that lockdowns work, then they modified their policy on that because of its impact to marginal</p>
<p>groups. And so the WHO has just gotten everything wrong this year. And despite that fact, you now</p>
<p>have to Chamath&rsquo;s point, Google, YouTube, and even sites like LinkedIn or Nextdoor are now censoring</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s statements if they contradict the WHO, apparently without irony, because nobody has</p>
<p>contradicted the WHO more than the WHO itself. I look forward to next year when nobody cares</p>
<p>about the WHO anymore. Great. Friedberg, what do you got? Flash in the pan.</p>
<p>I put hydroxychloroquine. You guys remember?</p>
<p>It was gonna save the world for a minute or two. And here we are. And so I&rsquo;m just gonna leave it</p>
<p>at that. Yeah, here we okay. Yeah, everybody knows. You may have heard of hydro chloroquine.</p>
<p>Okay. Some people say it&rsquo;s America. I took it. It&rsquo;s great. Chamath, what do you got?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite related to this. And I thought that she was marvelous. But I do think she</p>
<p>will disappear off the scene, which is Sarah Cooper, which, you know, basically,</p>
<p>in the last month of the campaign, kind of just disappeared. And now is, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>anybody knows who Sarah Cooper is, and probably in a year from now won&rsquo;t. But for the period for</p>
<p>the for those dark months of the pandemic, her mockery of Trump was some of the funniest</p>
<p>stuff on Twitter that I know. Sarah Cooper is amazing. Yeah, she got a Netflix and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;ll be a flash in the pan. I think she&rsquo;ll come back. I would have loved to pick</p>
<p>who was the press secretary for with the southern accent for Trump sacks.</p>
<p>Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Yeah, Huckabee. She but I think she was gone in by 2020. So I can&rsquo;t pick</p>
<p>her but she was amazing at defending Trump. She&rsquo;s like, you all are dumb and Trump is smart and he</p>
<p>has 150 IQ and he owns Mar-a-Lago and he has a jet and his jet. You are the big news media. And</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you say. American public know what you say. And Trump is amazing in bed. He was</p>
<p>banging porn stars when y&rsquo;all were jerking. I mean, he&rsquo;s just she would defend him. I that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I want as my PR person. She defended him for all time. My biggest flash in the plan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need a PR person. I don&rsquo;t need a PR person. I got this. We got this podcast. Now</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need the press or PR. We just go right to the audience.</p>
<p>Nicola trading at $34 billion. They took your precious SPACs Chamath and they perverted it with</p>
<p>a dipshit Milton who was on my podcast and couldn&rsquo;t answer basic questions. It&rsquo;s now worth 6</p>
<p>billion. I predicted it will be worth 60 cents. I kid you not. This company will go to zero is my</p>
<p>prediction. If you are buying companies and I made Jason, you&rsquo;re going to scare all founder,</p>
<p>all founder CEOs are going to avoid coming on your podcast now. No, no, no, no. I&rsquo;m delightful.</p>
<p>But for this kid, he&rsquo;s under investigation. Your company is worth nothing. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re weak, Lizzy. No, he&rsquo;s under investigation. The thing&rsquo;s a disaster. They&rsquo;re obviously riding</p>
<p>on Elon&rsquo;s coattails. He couldn&rsquo;t make a decision if it was hydrogen powered cars or electric trucks</p>
<p>or whatever. The company&rsquo;s in chaos. I made a rule, which is if a company has not released</p>
<p>their product and it&rsquo;s worth over a billion dollars, be careful because it could be a fraud</p>
<p>or it could be a disaster. That&rsquo;s my biggest flash in the pan, Nicola.</p>
<p>Biggest breakthrough. Freeberg, you want to start us off on this one? I have an idea. I think I know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to say. I&rsquo;m going to say AlphaFold. You know that we talked about in the</p>
<p>last podcast. I think AlphaFold feels to me like what ARPANET was, which was the origins of the</p>
<p>internet, you know, back when it was first installed and no one really kind of grappled</p>
<p>with the ramifications of what would emerge. And I think, you know, once we have the ability to</p>
<p>design proteins to do things, a lot&rsquo;s going to change in the world of medicine and human health</p>
<p>and longevity and the kind of environment. And it&rsquo;s going to be pretty powerful. So I&rsquo;m excited</p>
<p>about AlphaFold creating a foundation for humanity&rsquo;s ability to do those things.</p>
<p>Jamal, what do you got? 100% AlphaFold. There&rsquo;s not a close second, to be honest.</p>
<p>Okay, Sax? Well, as a close second, I guess I would</p>
<p>I would mention the mRNA vaccines, which we talked about on the show, the ability to basically</p>
<p>print a vaccine in two days, and hopefully they will follow our advice about challenge vaccines</p>
<p>for the next time we have one of these pandemics. Challenge trials.</p>
<p>Challenge trials. We can respond much more quickly. And then just quickly in politics,</p>
<p>I thought the biggest breakthrough was Pete Buttigieg. He made the unlikely leap from mayor</p>
<p>of South Bend, Indiana to being the first credible openly gay candidate for president.</p>
<p>He won Iowa, sort of, along with Bernie Sanders, and was a very close second in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be the he&rsquo;s going to be the director of the transportation department</p>
<p>in the Biden administration. By the way, Sax, I want to just point something out on your sorry,</p>
<p>Jake, but, you know, the mRNA vaccine technology has been around for like 15 years,</p>
<p>and regulatory barriers and regulatory constraints have largely kept this stuff</p>
<p>from coming to market. And it&rsquo;s interesting how, you know, in a year where we have this pandemic</p>
<p>emergency, we can take this technology that has been around and has been available to us for so</p>
<p>long. And suddenly, you know, all the regulatory barriers get dropped and things come to market</p>
<p>to change the world. I think it&rsquo;s a great highlight of like, what&rsquo;s possible when some regulatory</p>
<p>constraints are diminished a little bit. And technology is really allowed to flourish and</p>
<p>see the light of day. And, you know, we all act so surprised that this technology works,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been here for a while. It&rsquo;s pretty, pretty astounding that it hasn&rsquo;t worked or</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been allowed to work in the past. In a previous episode, just an observation,</p>
<p>I think. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a really valid one, because it wasn&rsquo;t a breakthrough that</p>
<p>occurred this year. The breakthrough was they broke through the regulations. You said you</p>
<p>wanted to wait and see some people get the vaccines first. And then that led to some</p>
<p>accounts on the Twitter saying, Are you still anti vaccination? And I had to correct them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never said you were anti vaccination. To be clear. Not at all. No, no, no. Yes. No,</p>
<p>no. I think my point is, I think a lot of people are going to latch on. Sorry,</p>
<p>let me just be really clear. I think a lot of people are going to latch on</p>
<p>to the small number of cases that are going to be amplified of people having adverse reactions</p>
<p>to this, you know, new technology vaccine in Alaska the other day, like two days ago,</p>
<p>there was a nurse who got the vaccine, and she had a really bad anaphylactic reaction to it,</p>
<p>she had to be given epinephrine twice to survive. And she came out and she was fine. But it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>storytelling. That&rsquo;s like, you know, they assume it should be some small percentage of people will</p>
<p>have some reaction to this thing. But that is the storytelling that will keep people from doing this.</p>
<p>And I think that is the biggest kind of concern. And that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve got guys like Mike Pence</p>
<p>doing the vaccine tomorrow. You know, he&rsquo;s gonna do it on live TV and celebrities like</p>
<p>Ian McKellen doing it. They&rsquo;re trying to kind of create a way. Are we going to see Mike Pence&rsquo;s</p>
<p>naked shoulder and bicep on television? Because mom doesn&rsquo;t want his mother is mother gonna be</p>
<p>beside his wife. Actually, mother&rsquo;s gonna give it to him. Because if a if a woman doctor gave it to</p>
<p>him, he would be kind of like cheating because she stuck something in him, you know, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not right. Okay, I can&rsquo;t wait to take it. If anybody doesn&rsquo;t want their vaccine, I will take</p>
<p>it because I&rsquo;m losing my mind in quarantine. I mean, for the love of God, smartest business move.</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>I think 2020 was the year of the SPAC. I think that it is in his it&rsquo;s an incredibly it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s done something really, really, really important in the capital market. So that can you</p>
<p>give Chamath his bestie award now? J. Cal? Yes.</p>
<p>Would you like an acceptance speech? I would like the smartest business move me.</p>
<p>Saks, what was your smartest business move? Or the smartest business move in business?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to thank Chamath for the SPAC thing too, because I was in open door</p>
<p>and I was in porch and both of them are SPACing this year. So</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m in desktop metal. I&rsquo;m gonna go we have to agree.</p>
<p>So thanks for the best business. You&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve wet you&rsquo;ve wet all of our beaks. So</p>
<p>yeah, I mean, I mean, actually, if you think about it, I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>six deals. Are you still talking about me?</p>
<p>We have to play the music, you know, the walk on music on the Oscars.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been nominated three times, but this is the only besties one.</p>
<p>I really wanted to be in that reality show with you and</p>
<p>I mean, talk about dodging a bullet. We went with this trailer to the top five studios.</p>
<p>They all wanted it in the room. NBC says we&rsquo;ll take it in the room.</p>
<p>The head of NBC says we&rsquo;ll take it. We taped the pilot and then beeps.</p>
<p>Whole career life blows up and thank the Lord that show didn&rsquo;t get on TV because</p>
<p>I would have been executive produced by beep. And yeah, that would have been bad. So no reality TV</p>
<p>for me. I had I had another smart business move. I just wanted to point out, which was</p>
<p>Salesforce buying Slack. I think it&rsquo;s brilliant for them. I think they&rsquo;re going to look back on</p>
<p>the 10 percent they paid of their capital for Slack. And I think Slack will be more important</p>
<p>than Salesforce ultimately in business. It&rsquo;s a huge most important brand there.</p>
<p>What a crown jewel. What a great what a great move by Benioff and Brett Taylor. And I just</p>
<p>think what a great asset. Totally. It&rsquo;d be better for them than YouTube is for Google</p>
<p>or Instagram is for I think I think it&rsquo;s on that level. Actually, I think it&rsquo;s of that order of</p>
<p>magnitude where the importance of those assets to those companies, Slack will be to Salesforce</p>
<p>cost cost 20 times, 30 times as much, though. So less upside, but less upside. But but in terms</p>
<p>of like lock in and value and, you know, the prevention of churn over time, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be huge. I mean, it could be at some point the company is Slack Salesforce like Slack</p>
<p>will be the preeminent brand there. David, did you go for this for smartest business move?</p>
<p>I agree. I agree with both the ones you&rsquo;ve already done.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna rattle one off real quick. I got I think people</p>
<p>miss this. But at the bottom of the market, Silverlake did this massive debt deal into Airbnb,</p>
<p>which, if you&rsquo;ll remember, is reminiscent to me of Warren Buffett, you know, giving $5 billion</p>
<p>to Swiss Re and Goldman Sachs. And he earned a 12 percent coupon and got warrants in both those</p>
<p>companies. And it just paid a tremendous return for him. Silverlake swooped in Airbnb in April,</p>
<p>gave him a 12% debt deal for a billion dollars, and they got warrants that the warrants today</p>
<p>are worth about $1.4 billion. And this debt is probably worth three times what they put in. So</p>
<p>in like five months, six months, these guys have basically turned a billion dollars of debt into</p>
<p>$4 billion of value. It was an incredible deal, incredibly gutsy. If you think about what we were</p>
<p>all feeling in early April about the market and where the world was headed, we had no fucking clue</p>
<p>for these guys to swoop in and do that I thought was super impressive. The other one, I had a</p>
<p>couple on this because I just I want to rattle these off. The other one was Bill Ackman bought</p>
<p>a fucking S&amp;P put sorry, bought an S&amp;P put for $27 million that he sold for $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>He bought he bought credit default insurance on a whole strip of debt.</p>
<p>But he turned a $27 million insurance instrument into $2.6 billion of returns for his fund. And</p>
<p>he still didn&rsquo;t sell his portfolio. In fact, he bought at the bottom. And I mean, the foresight</p>
<p>this guy had going into the down market ahead of March, he saw that the market was going to tank</p>
<p>because of COVID. He made a bet on it. It was a tiny bet for him. But man to turn $27 million into</p>
<p>$2.6 billion in like 60 days or 90 days, unbelievable. And then he bought stock in</p>
<p>his companies at the bottom. What a gutsy investor. And then I was anything. Yeah,</p>
<p>was there anything fugazi on that with where he had gone on CNBC and talk? And he did this whole</p>
<p>big, you know? No, no. Yeah, he did it afterwards. But I think he&rsquo;s I think he&rsquo;s great. I think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great. Yeah, I think it was it was incredible. And my third one, which we don&rsquo;t talk about a lot</p>
<p>is Larry Ellison bought a billion dollars of Tesla stock less than two years ago, that is now</p>
<p>worth over $10 billion. And he didn&rsquo;t he joined the board. And, you know, you put your money where</p>
<p>your mouth is, and you take ownership. And, you know, I don&rsquo;t know much about Larry. But there</p>
<p>was a lot of naysayers about Tesla saying they were bubbly and overvalued at that time. And it</p>
<p>was really in the middle of the Tesla Q shorting movement. And now he can buy not just Lanai,</p>
<p>but he could probably get Kauai to go with it. He could buy another island. Anyway, those were</p>
<p>three gutsy bets that I thought were worth highlighting that that just really impressed</p>
<p>me. And you know, it&rsquo;s when the markets are down, when you&rsquo;re facing the abyss,</p>
<p>when everyone else is telling you you&rsquo;re wrong, and you make a big bet like that.</p>
<p>And it pays off. That&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that I think returns are made from and characters built.</p>
<p>And those are those are just really impressive moves for me that</p>
<p>there was a lot of impressive moves this year, the tide went out and came back in real quick.</p>
<p>So there were some dumb business moves as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually got a dumb business move that was a highlight for 2020.</p>
<p>The city of San Francisco biting the hand that feeds it. For years, these politicians have been</p>
<p>shitting on the tech community, acting like the tech community was somehow a parasite on San</p>
<p>Francisco. Well, you know, now because of COVID, the tech community has the option to leave,</p>
<p>you have a lot of people leaving and there are gigantic budget deficits for the city.</p>
<p>The schools have giant budget deficits, it&rsquo;s not clear how they&rsquo;re going to close these things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s looking more and more like it wasn&rsquo;t tech that was a parasite. It was the politicians</p>
<p>who are the parasites and nobody knows how to fix the city of San Francisco anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. Dumbest business move, Chamath?</p>
<p>I think it was, I think it was probably for me, the governor of California&rsquo;s handling of COVID.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s more political than business. But</p>
<p>well, no, I mean, it did impact businesses. So I think you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, I think that allow it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll allow it. I think that I think that what he showed was how naked partisanship was in decision</p>
<p>making that had that should have been based on science, in fact, and the quality of the decision</p>
<p>making just eroded every single decision that he made. And then now, you know, as David said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like you have this just just, you know, you have this moment where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, the just the cake moment where he&rsquo;s eating at French Laundry. And the day after,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s basically shutting the whole world down again. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very frustrating.</p>
<p>So I think that also is shutting down beaches, right? And then, you know, the stay at home orders</p>
<p>and not letting people leave their house and go to a beach or eat outdoors. All that is,</p>
<p>is send them inside, they&rsquo;re gonna have a party inside their house.</p>
<p>Well, there was a great tweet. There&rsquo;s a great tweet that said, you know, I&rsquo;m not allowed to</p>
<p>go to the store. I&rsquo;m not allowed to go to the shopping center, but I&rsquo;m going to take my child</p>
<p>on a walk. And if anybody stops me, I&rsquo;m just going to tell them I&rsquo;m taking her to the nail salon.</p>
<p>And the reason is because you couldn&rsquo;t walk to the park, but you could you could go to the nail</p>
<p>salon. And so, you know, this tweet was just reminiscent of just how arbitrary and random</p>
<p>this stuff was. And it had just so many downstream impact. So I think that was a huge fail.</p>
<p>And nobody loves hypocrisy. I picked my smartest business move with Salesforce buying slack.</p>
<p>Conversely, I&rsquo;m picking my dumbest business move with slacks board selling slack. This is</p>
<p>the stupidest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I understand they felt like maybe it was a great deal.</p>
<p>But I would have much rather them see seeing them do what I do.</p>
<p>To be honest with you, I mean, I left the board and I just don&rsquo;t know why I wish I could have</p>
<p>gotten the call because I would have bought it. Yeah, I agree with you. I think network effects</p>
<p>are incredibly unique assets. They&rsquo;re very, very rare. I think we&rsquo;ve all been around them. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>worked in them. David has David, the other David has I have Jason, you have it is the single most</p>
<p>incredible momentum, momentum driver and, you know, sort of tailwind. And when it exists,</p>
<p>you just never give it up. And so I agree with you, I would have bought slack if I could have</p>
<p>if they would have given me a shot. We ride our winners, and you appreciate network effects.</p>
<p>If you look at what Jeff Lawson did at Twilio, he started with much less, I think,</p>
<p>he started with nothing, started with Twilio. Jeff Lawson buys SendGrid and segment. Their</p>
<p>market cap has gone 12. It was it&rsquo;s 12x market cap, they went from $29 a share to $365 a year</p>
<p>in three years, they&rsquo;re at 60 billion. Slack should have been buying other companies with</p>
<p>their equity, and they should have built and rolled up all of the other hub spots or whatever</p>
<p>else is out there that I think it&rsquo;s by Zendesk, whatever. I&rsquo;m not sure that the M&amp;A strategy</p>
<p>was the hard part. I just think that it&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re in the bowels of these companies,</p>
<p>as we all know, it&rsquo;s super hard, right? So I mean, I don&rsquo;t think you can fail Stuart and the team.</p>
<p>But I think that somewhere along the way, just the realization of how special and unique that</p>
<p>network effect was, didn&rsquo;t happen, because it would have given a different team a level of</p>
<p>energy or comfort to kind of really go for the brass ring, as you said, and but you know,</p>
<p>hopefully they&rsquo;ll be able to execute it at Salesforce. Okay, did I get everybody&rsquo;s dumbest</p>
<p>business move? My dumbest business move was myself. So I will take, I will accept the award</p>
<p>for being a schmuck is for me, me and anyone else that fucking hedged or shorted the market or sold</p>
<p>during the dip. In March, I learned the most valuable lesson I&rsquo;ve learned in my investing</p>
<p>career to date, you just want to invest in whole chairs and great businesses and not try and tie</p>
<p>markets because that&rsquo;s always a loser&rsquo;s game and a fool&rsquo;s errand. And I think, you know, worrying</p>
<p>about the market going down or up, as long as you hold shares and great businesses, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter. Trading is not for me, it was stupid. And I just feel like a lot of people learned that</p>
<p>lesson this year. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people that kind of freaked out and got out of the market,</p>
<p>and then they regretted it and tried to get back in and it was too late. And</p>
<p>I read a document that someone wrote for me. And she wrote this incredible quote that I had</p>
<p>never heard from Buffett. And I&rsquo;ll give it to you, Friedberg, because it&rsquo;s very apropos of this.</p>
<p>Buffett had this statement, which is that, you know, it&rsquo;s not about timing the market,</p>
<p>it is about time in market. And I just think that&rsquo;s so beautiful, because it&rsquo;s so simple,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically summarizes exactly what you said, which is get in, close your eyes. And if</p>
<p>you if, again, unless for liquidity, you just don&rsquo;t ever sell. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s errand to</p>
<p>try to time the market, sit on your hands, ride your winners. And he always said, listen, if a</p>
<p>business is on, if I own this business, and I love it, and it&rsquo;s at a discount, I should want to own</p>
<p>more of it. I believe that was another Buffett, I don&rsquo;t know the exact quote. But let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>smartest political move. And we&rsquo;ll go to our token, Republican David Sachs for that.</p>
<p>Well, well, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s funny, you identify me that way, because my my smart,</p>
<p>the smartest political move goes to Congressman Jim Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, for</p>
<p>endorsing Joe Biden just before the South Carolina primary, a number of people on the Biden campaign</p>
<p>were panicking, they wanted him to do it early, because Biden had bombed in Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>And Clyburn kept his powder dry, and endorsed Biden at the absolute perfect time it caused</p>
<p>Biden to win South Carolina. And that led him to sweep on Super Tuesday. Jim Clyburn was the</p>
<p>kingmaker of 2020. Without him, Joe Biden would not be president. Wow, okay, who you got Freeberg?</p>
<p>smartest political move of 2020 was Joe Biden staying quiet, hanging out in his bunker,</p>
<p>and letting Trump do his own damage. End of story. I feel like I feel like if you know that</p>
<p>Biden knew that it wasn&rsquo;t his election to win, it was Trump&rsquo;s election to lose. And I think he let</p>
<p>him go out and lose it. And, and that, to me, was smart advice and smart action. Yes. So he just</p>
<p>slow played aces, he hit a set, he just checked, and he watched him fire. Who do you got Chamath</p>
<p>smartest political move, smartest political move, which you will not see until 2022,</p>
<p>or 23. But laid the groundwork this year, and I thought it was brilliantly done was Nikki Haley,</p>
<p>who I think will be the Republican nominee for president in 2024. And she did an unbelievable</p>
<p>job of tricking Trump to believe that he was her supporter, then getting distribution,</p>
<p>and then basically subtly telling everybody that she thought that he was an idiot. And I thought</p>
<p>that she was brilliant in so she didn&rsquo;t look like a rat leaving the ship. She looked like,</p>
<p>you know, a rebel or something getting off. I think I think if you want to find</p>
<p>somebody to consolidate center right politics in 2024, my money would be on Nikki Haley.</p>
<p>All right, I went with the smartest political move. I also went for the long game Pete Buttigieg,</p>
<p>going on Fox recently, I think he did obviously a masterful job. You had that sex earlier,</p>
<p>but he started going on Fox and basically being really spicy with them and supporting the hell</p>
<p>out of Biden. And then he gets himself this Secretary of Transportation. And I think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>set up to either be the VP or the presidential candidate in the future. And he&rsquo;s I think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be one of the bright stars. I also would. I think Andrew Yang, it did nothing</p>
<p>happened for him this year. Really? I don&rsquo;t know. But I felt like he also is. My understanding is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to run for mayor of New York. That was another amazing political winner in all of this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anybody has feelings on either of those.</p>
<p>I love I love Andrew Yang. I think he&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s coming on the pot.</p>
<p>Pragmatic, centrist, smart, capable, competent. He&rsquo;s great. He attracts it. He attracts the</p>
<p>plurality of people. Yeah. And I think he&rsquo;s spoken out against cancel culture. And so,</p>
<p>you know, whenever I see somebody on the left speaking out against cancel culture and censorship,</p>
<p>like the way Chamath has, that definitely to me, elevates them in my book.</p>
<p>Are you saying Chamath is someone from the left?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s amazing how much we agree on, you know.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s you have this left and right definitions which have become very</p>
<p>hard to understand. And I think what we have to get back to is the American principled idea of</p>
<p>freedoms and opportunity. Right. And I don&rsquo;t think either of the parties actually were representing</p>
<p>that properly. Dumbest political move of the year. I think I know where everybody&rsquo;s going to go with</p>
<p>this, but I would like to know. Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani&rsquo;s press conference at the sex shop.</p>
<p>I mean, just, I mean, how amateurish is that group of people?</p>
<p>The Four Seasons, gardening. Were they trolling us and trying to get press for it? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that one. Unbelievable, unbelievable. So you go with Rudy Giuliani for the dumbest</p>
<p>political move. Sachs, what do you got? I have a feeling I know what Sachs got.</p>
<p>Well, I got, I got a tie here between one was defund the police, you know, as a political</p>
<p>slogan, the whole country, you know, the BLM movement had the whole country on its side.</p>
<p>After the, you know, the George Floyd video came out, everybody was in favor of sensible</p>
<p>reforms to control the use of force by the police. And then they introduced the slogan of defund the</p>
<p>police and it scared voters across the country into voting for Republicans in Congress. And it</p>
<p>probably cost Joe Biden, not the presidency, but Congress. And my tie, the other half of that was</p>
<p>Donald Trump refusing to wear a mask or to endorse masks. He finally did it, but it was two or three</p>
<p>months too late. If he had just gotten on board with masks, it would have been a very easy thing</p>
<p>to do politically, personally, that could have made the margin of difference. He might still be</p>
<p>president if he had gotten on board with mass about three months earlier.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what was your dumbest? I actually, yeah, I put making masks political more broadly,</p>
<p>both the left and the right pointing fingers about masks. I mean, this is like a human</p>
<p>life issue. And, you know, kind of shaming the Republicans for not wearing masks and making it</p>
<p>about we&rsquo;re the right guys. You&rsquo;re the wrong guys. Everyone should have avoided pointing fingers and</p>
<p>avoided not doing it because the other side was doing it. And it should have never, ever been</p>
<p>allowed to become political. It was pure science. It was about saving lives. And I think both sides</p>
<p>are to blame for, you know, the Democrats tried to make the Republicans look bad because they were</p>
<p>advocating for masks and they shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. And the Republicans should not have tried to</p>
<p>avoid wearing masks because the Democrats were telling them to wear masks. And it was just</p>
<p>a total cluster, really sad and, you know, could have made a big difference for 1000s of lives.</p>
<p>I too put Trump not advocating for masks as my dumbest political move. I believe he nailed the</p>
<p>stimulus, that first stimulus where he just dropped the 1200 checks and the PPP and everything. He</p>
<p>obviously nailed, you know, the Operation Lightspeed and the vaccines, he didn&rsquo;t get credit for it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that was political or not that they dropped them the week, the weeks after the</p>
<p>election. I think it was. I&rsquo;m a little bit cynical about that. But my God, is there nobody that this</p>
<p>man would listen to? And they must have all been telling him in unison, hey, dipshit, put the mask</p>
<p>on, we&rsquo;ll win the election. In July and August, the numbers started to go down precipitously.</p>
<p>And everybody, Fauci, everybody with half a brain was saying, second wave is coming,</p>
<p>wear masks. And he refused to take that stance. And not only did that, he doubled down like the</p>
<p>moron he is, and started doing rallies. This person is such a complete idiot, grifter and</p>
<p>just imbecile, that he couldn&rsquo;t see the clear path to victory. And he was tempting fate. And of course,</p>
<p>he winds up getting COVID. I mean, the idiocracy of the moment is just so profound. He absolutely</p>
<p>would have sailed into that second term. We were sitting here on this very podcast,</p>
<p>and we all believed he was going to sail into the second term when the market started ripping back</p>
<p>and the COVID numbers went down. And because of the stupidity of not wearing masks,</p>
<p>thank God we got him out. But to the families who lost loved ones, he&rsquo;s a murderer, period.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving on. Best political theorist.</p>
<p>Trump inhaling COVID into his body, and then taking the polyclonal antibodies to heal himself</p>
<p>and show the American population that it&rsquo;s just not that bad. It was the best stunt, the best</p>
<p>theater I&rsquo;ve seen. And I don&rsquo;t know what the hell else could have beaten it this year. I mean,</p>
<p>the guy literally stormed out, he buckled himself in, you know, buttoned up his jacket,</p>
<p>he stared out the lights in his face, he was glowing. He had the antibodies rushing through</p>
<p>his body. He was healing his body. He was on speed, man. I thought the best political theater</p>
<p>was when the Democratic leadership did like the Colin Kaepernick one knee in kente cloths</p>
<p>at the in the rotunda. Can somebody Nick, you just throw the picture of that up there.</p>
<p>I mean, I mean, half of them are sad for them are so old, they couldn&rsquo;t get down on</p>
<p>one pick them back up. They all hit their life alert. They got the life alert. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>falling. I can&rsquo;t get up. Like 20 life alerts. I&rsquo;ve never got off in the same room.</p>
<p>But the kente cloths were just so over the top. Like you didn&rsquo;t need the kente cloths.</p>
<p>They really weren&rsquo;t kente cloths. Oh my lord.</p>
<p>All right. My best political theater in a&hellip; I&rsquo;m crying. I&rsquo;m laughing so much.</p>
<p>My best political theater is, I don&rsquo;t know who this congresswoman is,</p>
<p>but I am falling in love with her. Her name is Katie Porter. She takes out a whiteboard.</p>
<p>She just&hellip; She&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s so great. She owns people with that whiteboard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the greatest. She basically does math. People are just&hellip; I mean, she&rsquo;s done this now</p>
<p>two or three times where she just takes people down and she did it to Mnuchin.</p>
<p>Like she was like, is today Tuesday? He&rsquo;s like, you know, today&rsquo;s Tuesday. She&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>can you tell me if today&rsquo;s Tuesday? And she just destroys people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just never seen anything like it. And she&rsquo;s awesome. So best political theater for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. David, did we get yours?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. I mean, so I thought the French laundry photos, all these politicians</p>
<p>are violating their own lockdown policies was some pretty good theater.</p>
<p>Theater? Theater?</p>
<p>Theater. Yeah. You had Gavin Newsom and London Brie dining at French Laundry. You had</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi going to that hair salon.</p>
<p>Any Republicans do something like that?</p>
<p>Well, I would tell you if I knew of any.</p>
<p>Trump rallies?</p>
<p>But yeah, but the Republicans haven&rsquo;t been supporting lockdowns. So look, if there was</p>
<p>a Republican who was supporting lockdowns&hellip; How about the Rose Garden Supreme Court where</p>
<p>they had a super spreader event at the White House?</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t political theater because they weren&rsquo;t violating their own policies.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>They were saying that people could take the risk.</p>
<p>Got it. Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m picking these politicians because they&rsquo;re hypocrites. Yeah. It&rsquo;s the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Uh, the one I loved the best out of all the hypocritical politicians was the one who was</p>
<p>like, please stay&hellip; It was the governor of someplace, Colorado or something. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, please stay home with your family. Do not travel for Thanksgiving. It&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be too dangerous. And then they find out he did that tweet while at a Southwest gate going</p>
<p>with his family to Thanksgiving. And they literally have pictures of him on his phone.</p>
<p>And the picture was timed at the timestamp of the tweet, if I have my understanding,</p>
<p>correct? I forgot the guy&rsquo;s name, but there were so many of these.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, let me give you another one. There was the LA County supervisor, Sheila Kuhl,</p>
<p>cast the deciding vote to shut down outdoor dining in Los Angeles only to be photographed</p>
<p>eating at Old Fornayo in Santa Monica two hours later. So it&rsquo;s just completely hypocritical. And</p>
<p>this is why there could be a big recall next year in California.</p>
<p>I think we have to put political theater as one category of just loathsome political theater,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going on to worse political theater and the stuff we&rsquo;ve seen has been pretty horrific.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lead us off with my worst political theater, which was the banning of TikTok</p>
<p>was absolutely the right thing to do. And then they just handed it off as like a gift to Oracle</p>
<p>to make money and maybe be their server farm. I don&rsquo;t understand. We were supposed to ban it and</p>
<p>get it the fuck out of the app store. And that was just terrible political theater. Anybody else</p>
<p>got more political theater that will put in our loathsome political theater?</p>
<p>Well, Jason, just so you understand that I&rsquo;m being politically even-handed, this is where</p>
<p>I had Rudy Giuliani and his tour of self-immolation from the press conference in front of the</p>
<p>crematorium to the hair dye meltdown to the- To the tour ad video.</p>
<p>All right, we need to hold on. Hold on. I&rsquo;m going to call an audible. I&rsquo;m calling an audible here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have a new category. To get in COVID.</p>
<p>Worst Rudy Giuliani moment. Can we have a Giuliani award? Can we have the Giuliani award next year?</p>
<p>Yeah, Giuliani award for self-immolation. It&rsquo;s like, what is the most self-destructive?</p>
<p>Yeah, the self-immolation award. What is the worst Giuliani moment?</p>
<p>Oh, I think the saddest moment was in the Borat thing. That was sad because you just felt like</p>
<p>this is an old broken man. It was creepy and it was just sad.</p>
<p>He was desperate and he was creepy and it was-</p>
<p>But the worst- Rudy Giuliani lifetime award.</p>
<p>The worst though was actually, if you listened to the testimony when he farted, it was really</p>
<p>terrible. Did he fart twice?</p>
<p>It was really terrible actually. If you listen to the testimony, you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>what is this guy saying? It&rsquo;s out of control.</p>
<p>Well, also, I think we have to cut into here. The poor woman sitting next to him,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s clearly in range. I mean, she&rsquo;s in the blast zone. He rips it. He rips it.</p>
<p>And she looks him. She gives him side eye, but she is so scared to react</p>
<p>to such an obvious carpet bombing that she just keeps a straight face, but her eyes go.</p>
<p>That was unforgivable.</p>
<p>It must have been a stinker. Must have been a stinker.</p>
<p>I mean, it was loud. It had resonance. It was, yeah.</p>
<p>Can I give one other example? And I don&rsquo;t know whether this is best or worst theater,</p>
<p>but the congressional hearings with the tech CEOs where the senators grilled all of the tech CEOs,</p>
<p>and it was definitely political theater, but on the other hand, they all deserved it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be more of it next year.</p>
<p>Okay. Let&rsquo;s do lightning round as we wrap up.</p>
<p>I put that one as my worst political theater, because I thought what was so depressing about</p>
<p>it was how little the congressional, the Congress people actually understood of these businesses.</p>
<p>And they went off on rants and tirades about, you&rsquo;re blocking Republican voice on Twitter,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing this. And none of it actually focused on the monopolistic practices that was</p>
<p>the intention of the hearing in the first place. When they actually got into those points, when</p>
<p>they tried to talk about how the ad networks work and how targeting works, they didn&rsquo;t have any clue.</p>
<p>I mean, the people inside these companies don&rsquo;t even know how it worked and they built it. I mean,</p>
<p>these things are complex.</p>
<p>I know. I&rsquo;ll tell you, I just think it&rsquo;s really sad that folks in Congress, honestly, are so</p>
<p>disconnected from understanding technology and understanding modern business practices,</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t actually tackle the real issues. And it makes me a little scared.</p>
<p>Well, and neither does the squad. I mean, AOC didn&rsquo;t understand what a tax break was. I mean,</p>
<p>even the young ones don&rsquo;t understand stuff. I mean, we&rsquo;re getting the worst possible representation.</p>
<p>Okay, now we&rsquo;re going to go to lightning round with our final two categories. Best meme. For</p>
<p>me, it was the funeral dancers, followed up by Michael Jordan. I took that personally. And I,</p>
<p>of course, loved Chamath&rsquo;s mix up that one of you maniac, all in army members made.</p>
<p>Who got best memes? Any got a best meme?</p>
<p>Toobin.</p>
<p>Toobin.</p>
<p>Toobin.</p>
<p>Toobin. Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Forever a cautionary tale about what not to do on a Zoom call.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, that would be arguably in political theater. Let&rsquo;s say no.</p>
<p>Anybody else got a meme? Best or worst?</p>
<p>I like the funeral dancers, but-</p>
<p>Funeral dancers are pretty great. David, anything for you?</p>
<p>I just want to say to everybody that&rsquo;s listening, I really hope that you guys have an incredible</p>
<p>holiday, and we can put this year behind us. And I hope for all of you guys that have gone</p>
<p>through hard times, just know that, you know, hopefully you got some friends to talk to and</p>
<p>family to see and talk to. And we love you. And we really appreciate that you take the time to</p>
<p>listen. And guys, I just want to say to you guys, I love you guys. I love you. I love you.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me get through a very difficult year.</p>
<p>Back at you. And I was very touched by the birthday present you sent me last week.</p>
<p>I was just-</p>
<p>Oh, you want to tell them what you got? You want to tell them what you got, big boy?</p>
<p>I mean, listen, I don&rsquo;t want to- Chamath, I get a big crate at the house.</p>
<p>It was, I was born in 1970, and he got some of the best wines from 1970</p>
<p>and put them in a box. And, you know, I literally had to put them on a shelf and say,</p>
<p>do not drink these. These things cost as much as the Teslas in the driveways. I mean,</p>
<p>some of these bottles are ridiculous. And I hope to crack them all open with you guys at the house</p>
<p>in 2021.</p>
<p>Happy, honestly, happy 50th birthday, big boy. It&rsquo;s a big, big milestone.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it was a little bittersweet, obviously. I was going to have some kind of</p>
<p>party or anything like that. And then what made it particularly hard and challenging was</p>
<p>my birthday was on Saturday, and my friend Tony Hsieh died on Friday,</p>
<p>on that day. And I had been dealing with Tony Hsieh being in a coma for the five, for the, no,</p>
<p>for 10 days before that. And then I found out that afternoon that they tragically had to pull</p>
<p>the plug. Or I assume that&rsquo;s what happened. I shouldn&rsquo;t say that. I don&rsquo;t want to speak out of</p>
<p>turn. But this has been a shitty year. And I really hope that anybody out there who is suffering</p>
<p>from mental illness or struggling in any way, call a friend. And I think the reason this podcast</p>
<p>has resonated with so many people, and I hear this from people when they listen to the pod,</p>
<p>is our friendship. And they hear us talk, and they hear us laugh, and they hear us joke,</p>
<p>and the value of friendship and the love and the joy. And people just can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>when Chamath says, and men say to each other, they love each other. And they can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that Sax almost is able to say it. And people think by episode 25, Sax will be able to say it</p>
<p>back to us. But we&rsquo;ll try right now. We&rsquo;ll see if we can close 2020-21. We&rsquo;re all going to say,</p>
<p>I love you, David Sax. And then let&rsquo;s just see if this can work. I love you, David Sax.</p>
<p>I love you, David Sax.</p>
<p>Back at you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take it. We&rsquo;ll take it. We&rsquo;ll take it. I love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you guys. Happy holidays.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>See you guys in the new year.</p>
<p>See you in the new year. Bye-bye, besties.</p>
