<p>online health consulting now which from</p>
<p>my home which is my home where I am now</p>
<p>which does sometimes get in the way of</p>
<p>the Miramar Jets it seems like but you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s the price of freedom the</p>
<p>sound of freedom as they say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>yeah well I&rsquo;m really glad that I had a</p>
<p>chance to chat with you simply because I</p>
<p>mean you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re like a</p>
<p>board-certified cardiologist and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been uh some concerns about cholesterol</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about that today and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also going to be speaking at our</p>
<p>summit which I&rsquo;m excited about as well</p>
<p>yeah so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s rare to find a</p>
<p>cardiologist that is that keto friendly</p>
<p>low carb tell me when you first got out</p>
<p>of practice</p>
<p>did you like 20 years ago I think right</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ve been practicing as a</p>
<p>cardiologist now for 15 years and of</p>
<p>course it was about 14 years before that</p>
<p>of college and med school residency and</p>
<p>fellowship all that fun stuff t to</p>
<p>become a cardiologist so it&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>while now yeah that&rsquo;s a lot of work so</p>
<p>coming out did you have did you have the</p>
<p>mindset of just low carb well you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just pretty much conventional you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to just do things according</p>
<p>to the American Heart Association</p>
<p>absolutely American Heart Association</p>
<p>knows all that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s how I came out</p>
<p>and actually my fellowship was actually</p>
<p>in a preventive cardiology fellowship it</p>
<p>was a combined general and preventive</p>
<p>fellowship and we were in Ornish style</p>
<p>program I mean we&rsquo;re a very low-fat</p>
<p>high-carb kind of program and you know</p>
<p>the things that we were teaching people</p>
<p>for exercise and stress management</p>
<p>and community involvement those are</p>
<p>crucial and I&rsquo;m so thankful for the</p>
<p>lessons I learned there but lessons I</p>
<p>learned from nutrition maybe not so much</p>
<p>and you know in retrospect it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>should have been a red flag seeing how</p>
<p>many people are struggling to maintain</p>
<p>that type of eating and how many people</p>
<p>were having cravings and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>longing for the days where they could</p>
<p>cheat do something different and you</p>
<p>know it just it wasn&rsquo;t a very</p>
<p>sustainable method for the majority of</p>
<p>people now what happens is some people</p>
<p>will thrive and some people will do</p>
<p>great and when you&rsquo;re going from a</p>
<p>standard American diet to that type of</p>
<p>diet of course there&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>subset that feel fantastic and most</p>
<p>people are gonna have some improvements</p>
<p>but the question then becomes what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen for the next ten years</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen for the next 20</p>
<p>years because I&rsquo;ve been let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you do for the next</p>
<p>couple weeks the next couple months I</p>
<p>care what&rsquo;s gonna happen for the rest of</p>
<p>your life and that&rsquo;s that was the impact</p>
<p>that I saw I wasn&rsquo;t having you know the</p>
<p>impact on people that they can make some</p>
<p>immediate changes but they were coming</p>
<p>right back having quote failed lifestyle</p>
<p>intervention and that&rsquo;s a term I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>grown to hate because it it implies that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve tried everything that we&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>every possible lifestyle we tried the</p>
<p>only possible lifestyle and they failed</p>
<p>that lifestyle and and that&rsquo;s when I</p>
<p>started to have this little bit of</p>
<p>awakening to say you know what maybe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not doing the right thing maybe</p>
<p>our message is wrong and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>actually millions of people as false</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s actually our fault and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how hard a weakening to have you know as</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine to say</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve been taught everything</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been practicing is actually wrong</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a tough thing to come to</p>
<p>grips with that&rsquo;s the big pill to</p>
<p>swallow yeah absolutely</p>
<p>so you so you eventually use you just</p>
<p>stumbled on low-carb and tell me a</p>
<p>little bit about like you yeah I did</p>
<p>just stumble on it so it was sort of</p>
<p>this major transformation time in my</p>
<p>life you know the other thing I realized</p>
<p>was I didn&rsquo;t spend 14 years learning to</p>
<p>become a cardiologist so I could you</p>
<p>know plug your information into some</p>
<p>calculator and have it spit out whether</p>
<p>to give you a medication like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the impact I wanted to have</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>and I was seeing that I wasn&rsquo;t affecting</p>
<p>people as I had hoped when I came out of</p>
<p>my fellowship and I was bright-eyed and</p>
<p>bushy-tailed and thought I was gonna</p>
<p>save the world of heart disease you know</p>
<p>the reality was far from that so I</p>
<p>actually that&rsquo;s when I started boundless</p>
<p>health and that&rsquo;s when I started up a</p>
<p>health coaching program with a friend of</p>
<p>mine and we were working out of the</p>
<p>basement of this gym and he&rsquo;s an amazing</p>
<p>trainer and health coach and on some of</p>
<p>our you know more challenging clients</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d say hey you should try a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet on this guy and I looked at him I</p>
<p>said I&rsquo;m a cardiologist I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>kill the guy I want to I want to help</p>
<p>the guy like what are you crazy and he</p>
<p>looked right back I mean he says so have</p>
<p>you looked into it you know the data</p>
<p>behind it and I had to be honest with</p>
<p>him I said actually no I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>specifically looked into it and that</p>
<p>started this journey I started to read</p>
<p>one thing and another thing and another</p>
<p>thing and then my eyes got a little</p>
<p>bigger and a little bigger and the world</p>
<p>opened up and all of a sudden I realized</p>
<p>wow there there really is this whole</p>
<p>other world out there that has been just</p>
<p>demonized by the medical community and</p>
<p>not talked about by the medical</p>
<p>community and for no good reason and</p>
<p>then once I learned about it and then</p>
<p>one started started implementing it with</p>
<p>a client&rsquo;s along with the health coach</p>
<p>Dustin I mean then all of a sudden it</p>
<p>was there&rsquo;s no turning back I mean once</p>
<p>you see the way you can impact people</p>
<p>and see improvements in their blood work</p>
<p>see improvement in their body</p>
<p>composition and how they feel and then</p>
<p>how their training and exercising and</p>
<p>just being able to really transform</p>
<p>their lives with a tool that&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>been taught before really I used to read</p>
<p>never you know in mainstream practice so</p>
<p>yeah that was a major awakening for me I</p>
<p>mean you&rsquo;re right at the cusp of where</p>
<p>most the damage occurs in the artery in</p>
<p>the coronary artery we hate high insulin</p>
<p>so right so here you are you&rsquo;re you you</p>
<p>do surgery still or yeah so I do the</p>
<p>angiograms where we put the catheters in</p>
<p>the arteries feed them up through the</p>
<p>heart inject the dye so we can see the</p>
<p>arteries and see where they&rsquo;re blocked</p>
<p>then if a stent is needed I&rsquo;ll call one</p>
<p>of my colleagues and to come put the</p>
<p>stent in but you know the way I look at</p>
<p>it every time I&rsquo;m in the cath lab every</p>
<p>time I put on the lead and put on the</p>
<p>sterile gear and end up in the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because we failed somewhere really</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s what it comes down to</p>
<p>because all of this I guess not all of</p>
<p>this but 85 to 90 percent of what I see</p>
<p>is preventable so by the time I see</p>
<p>people in the cath lab you know I needed</p>
<p>to see them 10 or 15 years earlier and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you know I&rsquo;m I still have my</p>
<p>traditional cardiology medical practice</p>
<p>but where I really get the most joy and</p>
<p>the most satisfaction to see people as</p>
<p>an online health coach right I sort of</p>
<p>say take off my doctor hat now I put on</p>
<p>my health coaching hat let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>your lifestyle let&rsquo;s talk about your</p>
<p>stress management let&rsquo;s talk about your</p>
<p>nutrition let&rsquo;s spend an hour and a half</p>
<p>talking about this rather than your</p>
<p>20-minute office visit you know going</p>
<p>over your prescriptions let&rsquo;s see how</p>
<p>this fits into your whole health and</p>
<p>lifestyle and your whole life really I</p>
<p>mean and that&rsquo;s what everybody should be</p>
<p>getting but our medical system is not</p>
<p>geared up to provide that you must be</p>
<p>honest it&rsquo;s now like when you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>right now you have a chance when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>duping someone or or evaluating someone</p>
<p>do you have a chance to get with them to</p>
<p>consult them on the diet or are they</p>
<p>open to it or yeah that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>question I mean I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>talking about it so the biggest</p>
<p>questions is are they going to be open</p>
<p>to it and and part of it is the</p>
<p>situation right when you&rsquo;re look if</p>
<p>someone comes in with a heart attack and</p>
<p>someone ends up with a stent and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have five new medications and</p>
<p>their life has just been turned upside</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>on the one hand that&rsquo;s a great time to</p>
<p>talk about it because they&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>sort of scare factor on the other hand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrible time to talk about it</p>
<p>because so many things are transitioning</p>
<p>and you know may not be the right time</p>
<p>for the jump in do it so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>part of it is sort of reading the person</p>
<p>to see when is the right time to discuss</p>
<p>this but at some point they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>hear it from me tonight and I can only</p>
<p>hope that they&rsquo;re gonna internalize it</p>
<p>and I guess the flip side of that too is</p>
<p>saying like finding the right approach</p>
<p>for each person cuz there&rsquo;s not one diet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not one exercise program there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not one way to manage your stress right</p>
<p>there there are multitude out there and</p>
<p>some are going to work better than</p>
<p>others for each individual but the key</p>
<p>is to make them all an option what</p>
<p>really bothers me is that we say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one diet for people there&rsquo;s one exercise</p>
<p>program for people and that&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>what contemporary medicine says and I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s so just limiting and so</p>
<p>short-sighted and foolish of us and and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really why cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>continues to be the number one cause of</p>
<p>death and has continued to be that way</p>
<p>for decades it&rsquo;s not like this is a</p>
<p>brand new thing it&rsquo;s been that way for</p>
<p>decades and we haven&rsquo;t had the impact</p>
<p>that we really need to have to prevent</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease and to help</p>
<p>people live longer happier better lives</p>
<p>totally what would you&rsquo;ve had probably</p>
<p>people do Kido talk about what happens</p>
<p>if their their cholesterol starts going</p>
<p>higher they might be concerned oh my</p>
<p>gosh is this the right thing I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>all this fat let&rsquo;s talk about that yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a great point so the first</p>
<p>thing the first caveat is to say when</p>
<p>you look at the literature and you look</p>
<p>at the studies that have been done and</p>
<p>in my clinical practice the majority of</p>
<p>people who go on Kido Kido do not get in</p>
<p>a markedly elevated LDL so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first thing because because all you have</p>
<p>to here is a couple case examples see a</p>
<p>couple cases on the Internet to think oh</p>
<p>my god everybody who goes keto is gonna</p>
<p>have an LDL particle number of 3,000 no</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work that way and all you</p>
<p>have to do is look at the majority of</p>
<p>the studies have been done that show</p>
<p>either no change in April lipoprotein B</p>
<p>or a small change in LDL C but the</p>
<p>majority don&rsquo;t see this dramatic rise so</p>
<p>basically just because people are gonna</p>
<p>listen and go what does that mean a pony</p>
<p>brains talking about these little boats</p>
<p>that are carrying the cholesterol</p>
<p>through the body they&rsquo;re transport units</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dumping off different cargo</p>
<p>at different places and there are the</p>
<p>EPO is that because a little kind of</p>
<p>like the the driver of that it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>tells it what to do instructs it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the cheek you know the ship so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got your LDL lipoprotein and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your carrier molecule that has</p>
<p>the LDL cholesterol inside on the</p>
<p>surface of that lipoprotein is called an</p>
<p>April lipoprotein B and that&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>by definition every LDL boat every LDL</p>
<p>lipoprotein has one of those people B&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so people tend to use an interchange</p>
<p>the LDL particle number or Abel B you</p>
<p>can sort of use interchangeably to talk</p>
<p>about the number of these boats floating</p>
<p>around and then the LDL cholesterol is</p>
<p>the amount of cholesterol inside all of</p>
<p>those boats okay and traditionally we</p>
<p>use LDL cholesterol as the</p>
<p>end-all-be-all measure but really it is</p>
<p>a far inferior measure to able B or o</p>
<p>the lipoprotein particle number so the</p>
<p>words get big it gets a little confusing</p>
<p>but the number of particles are more</p>
<p>important than the amount total amount</p>
<p>of cholesterol okay so and for the most</p>
<p>part most people don&rsquo;t get a dramatic</p>
<p>rise so that&rsquo;s the first understanding</p>
<p>with a low-carb akido diet now those</p>
<p>that do the question becomes what does</p>
<p>it mean and that is a very muddy waters</p>
<p>indeed because there&rsquo;s this teaching</p>
<p>from that have been passed down for</p>
<p>decades that any elevated LDL is</p>
<p>dangerous regardless of the circumstance</p>
<p>but the problem is any of those studies</p>
<p>that have been done to date not a single</p>
<p>one is focused on people who are</p>
<p>following a low carb lifestyle who are</p>
<p>burning fat for fuel and who are</p>
<p>improving all these other markers of</p>
<p>insulin resistance and diabetes and</p>
<p>inflammation and metabolic health and</p>
<p>all those improving while you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>fat for fuel none of those people have</p>
<p>been included in any of those studies</p>
<p>okay and oh by the way those studies</p>
<p>show a Moose&rsquo;s you know sort of a</p>
<p>weakest Association it&rsquo;s definitely an</p>
<p>association but is not that everybody</p>
<p>with a high LDL is automatically getting</p>
<p>a heart attack right there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re people live to point out how</p>
<p>many paradoxes there are there are tons</p>
<p>of paradoxes tons of examples of</p>
<p>populations with high LDL s and yet</p>
<p>thrive and do well so there are plenty</p>
<p>of reasons to say there are subsets of</p>
<p>people who do just fine with elevated</p>
<p>LDL so could the low-carb enthusiast the</p>
<p>keto diet follower could that person be</p>
<p>one of them we don&rsquo;t have the evidence</p>
<p>to say that for sure but gosh their</p>
<p>shares a lot of reason to say it might</p>
<p>be the case so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really confusing situation because most</p>
<p>people are going to go to their doctor</p>
<p>and if they have a high LDL either</p>
<p>outcomes of statin prescription or the</p>
<p>doctor says you&rsquo;re killing yourself with</p>
<p>this diet you have to stop ignoring the</p>
<p>fact that they feel better than they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost the weight they have more energy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve reversed their metabolic</p>
<p>disease and all that right you&rsquo;re with</p>
<p>one markers off so you&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>yourself so instead you really have to</p>
<p>take a step back and see things from a</p>
<p>much broader perspective and say okay</p>
<p>why are you doing this what improvements</p>
<p>are you seeing when is the what</p>
<p>negatives I guess you could you could</p>
<p>say or have you seen which is using just</p>
<p>the LDL and then what does that mean for</p>
<p>your overall picture and that&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>have to dig deeper whether it&rsquo;s calcium</p>
<p>scores whether it&rsquo;s carotid intima-media</p>
<p>thickness testing whether it&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>at the size and density of the LDL and</p>
<p>the LDL pattern and your inflammatory</p>
<p>markers if there&rsquo;s god there has to be a</p>
<p>deeper evaluation I think personally</p>
<p>than just the reflex you have to get off</p>
<p>your diet or you have to take a statin</p>
<p>because this is a very special subset</p>
<p>population and and again that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>really enjoy working with people as a</p>
<p>health coach online because you can take</p>
<p>the time to go through all this right</p>
<p>you can yeah I&rsquo;m just gonna say that I</p>
<p>want to chime in because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a simple answer it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>muddiness that you have to understand</p>
<p>some basic physiology to really get the</p>
<p>truth on it because you can&rsquo;t even take</p>
<p>one little indicator LDL and you have to</p>
<p>look at other things as well and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dying you&rsquo;re stay on the far side</p>
<p>than the size of the particle so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so true and and I know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people watching right now and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to tell people I&rsquo;m gonna put a</p>
<p>link down below to your website so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of people</p>
<p>that want to consult with you so they</p>
<p>can get more information with the link</p>
<p>down below because they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>probably want to you know pick your</p>
<p>brain so I&rsquo;m dirty so I want to just</p>
<p>shift gears to calcium in the Artemis</p>
<p>coronary artery calcium there&rsquo;s a test</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s tell us a little bit about what</p>
<p>that is and how that would compare to</p>
<p>maybe other indicators for risk for</p>
<p>heart disease yeah it&rsquo;s a great question</p>
<p>so coronary artery calcium score is a</p>
<p>very simple</p>
<p>CT scan a cat scan takes about 10</p>
<p>seconds no contrast no ID a low</p>
<p>radiation dose generally people say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about the same as a mammogram you know</p>
<p>very low radiation dose in terms of CT</p>
<p>scans because there are plenty of other</p>
<p>higher radiation doses a relatively low</p>
<p>radiation dose and it can tell you if</p>
<p>you have calcium in the walls of your</p>
<p>artery so it does not tell you if you</p>
<p>have plaque or build up in the middle of</p>
<p>your arteries if you look at my hand</p>
<p>here if the middle is where the blood is</p>
<p>flowing and the fingers the outside of</p>
<p>the fingers here is the wall of the</p>
<p>artery that&rsquo;s where the calcium can get</p>
<p>deposited and what it tells you though</p>
<p>is that there has been vascular injury</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some type of a scalar</p>
<p>injury and a body&rsquo;s response to it which</p>
<p>is laid down the calcium you can get a</p>
<p>score from zero up to you know thousands</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen but they generally break it</p>
<p>down as zeros obviously great it means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had none of that vascular injury</p>
<p>in the calcium deposition zero to 100 as</p>
<p>being sort of a mild 100 to 400 is being</p>
<p>moderate are greater than 400 be severe</p>
<p>those are very loose definitions and age</p>
<p>plays a big role in that because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s also an age percentile</p>
<p>score that you get because the score of</p>
<p>20 and a 40 year old is very different</p>
<p>than the score of 20 in a 75 year old</p>
<p>because it means completely different</p>
<p>about the the speed and the likelihood</p>
<p>that you can develop injury okay so what</p>
<p>studies have shown is that the higher</p>
<p>the degree of calcium the higher the</p>
<p>risk of having a cardiovascular event</p>
<p>and it tends to track them better than</p>
<p>LDL cholesterol as a solitary marker it</p>
<p>tends to charge better for a one time</p>
<p>test than the carotid intima-media</p>
<p>thickness test is it it&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>test to get it&rsquo;s so good in fact that</p>
<p>the latest cholesterol guidelines by the</p>
<p>ACC and the ETA finally recognized it as</p>
<p>a test that should be done in the</p>
<p>majority of intermediate risk patients</p>
<p>to help better identify whether they are</p>
<p>a candidate for a drug is basically how</p>
<p>the guidelines think about it I would</p>
<p>think about a little bit differently but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the first time they&rsquo;ve come out and</p>
<p>said look with the calcium score of zero</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not going to benefit</p>
<p>drug so statin prescription would not be</p>
<p>in to get in that case which is for you</p>
<p>know an aaj ACC type of guideline that</p>
<p>cardiology Association guidelines to say</p>
<p>that is is revolutionary really so that</p>
<p>shows how powerful this test can be but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so huge yeah I I recommend it to</p>
<p>patients is because I said it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>quick test it&rsquo;s not expensive and it can</p>
<p>give you a lot of data because if your</p>
<p>score is like over a thousand you better</p>
<p>change it&rsquo;s time to change your diet</p>
<p>right because it&rsquo;s time to change</p>
<p>something it&rsquo;s probably time to change a</p>
<p>lot of things right one of the hard</p>
<p>things is though there&rsquo;s no time stamp</p>
<p>on it</p>
<p>right so you can have somebody who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been leading a standard American diet</p>
<p>insulin resistant for 20 years and then</p>
<p>they decide to go low-carb and improve</p>
<p>their lifestyle and start exercising and</p>
<p>six months later they get a high calcium</p>
<p>score there&rsquo;s no time stamp on that</p>
<p>calcium score it doesn&rsquo;t tell you when</p>
<p>it came up so it could have been that it</p>
<p>had been you know a lot of people would</p>
<p>say oh it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re low carb now</p>
<p>if you have this I calcium but actually</p>
<p>it was probably that 20 years of</p>
<p>standard American living that caused it</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why some people recommend if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go low-carb before going</p>
<p>to drastically change your lifestyle get</p>
<p>a calcium score so you timestamp it you</p>
<p>have a time zero and no moving forward</p>
<p>you can retest it again in three or five</p>
<p>years or something like that to see if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a change because otherwise</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no time stamp yeah so basically</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really evaluate something</p>
<p>unless you have two numbers you have to</p>
<p>go is it getting better or is it getting</p>
<p>worse so that&rsquo;ll tell you trends you</p>
<p>know um great point do you happen to</p>
<p>like like your cardiologist friends and</p>
<p>things your associate associate doctors</p>
<p>that you you know work with or do they</p>
<p>are they open to it is it because it</p>
<p>changing what&rsquo;s happening in that area</p>
<p>yeah I wish I could say it was changing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re open to it the vast majority</p>
<p>are not no question about it because you</p>
<p>know we&rsquo;ve been taught that is bad</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been taught ldlc is everything and</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve been taught something for 10</p>
<p>15 20 30 40 years and you&rsquo;ve told</p>
<p>thousands of patients that it is hard to</p>
<p>have that rehearsal so a lot of people</p>
<p>are not open to it and you know in</p>
<p>fairness some people would say look when</p>
<p>you show me</p>
<p>when you show me people living this way</p>
<p>for 20 years are doing great not having</p>
<p>heart attacks</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;ll jump on board at that point</p>
<p>but you know that data is hard to come</p>
<p>by and the data we have to this point</p>
<p>when you actually analyze the quality of</p>
<p>the data for low fat diets when you</p>
<p>analyze the quality of data for</p>
<p>cardiovascular outcomes it&rsquo;s really poor</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s all you have and you want to</p>
<p>be you know and you want to practice</p>
<p>according to the data then that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>you have but I think it&rsquo;s so much more</p>
<p>important to say what is the quality and</p>
<p>does it actually backup the</p>
<p>recommendations and that&rsquo;s where these</p>
<p>recommendations are to really break down</p>
<p>Wow interesting as far as like</p>
<p>arrhythmia it&rsquo;s atrial fib things like</p>
<p>that do you work with those clients as</p>
<p>well absolutely all the time do you ever</p>
<p>have you ever done any type of your own</p>
<p>research in doing more electrolytes more</p>
<p>minerals for these since the minerals</p>
<p>are associated with the pacemaker and</p>
<p>the nerve conduction of the vagus nerve</p>
<p>all that&rsquo;s a touch on that a little bit</p>
<p>yeah so so one thing I see very</p>
<p>frequently is just palpitations or the</p>
<p>general sensation of palpitations people</p>
<p>getting PVCs premature ventricular</p>
<p>contractions come in from the bottom</p>
<p>part of the heart or PA sees premature</p>
<p>atrial contractions coming from the top</p>
<p>part of the heart and those can be</p>
<p>brought on by caffeine and alcohol and</p>
<p>stress and like asleep and other</p>
<p>stimulants but they can also be brought</p>
<p>on by some electrode abnormalities and</p>
<p>frequently we are not good at testing</p>
<p>for electrolyte abnormalities because we</p>
<p>can just the potassium and magnesium in</p>
<p>your and the calcium in your blood but</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t test it the cells as well so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you could have a deficiency</p>
<p>and it couldn&rsquo;t it may not show up and</p>
<p>the way our food is you know farmed we</p>
<p>our vegetables get to us and our soil</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s we just all are probably walking</p>
<p>around a little bit magnesium deficient</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one of the first steps I</p>
<p>always have is a magnesium replacement</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a pill or whether it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>Epsom salt bath or some way to get more</p>
<p>magnesium into your system and a lot of</p>
<p>people find benefit with that phrase</p>
<p>palpitations other arrhythmias like a</p>
<p>fib</p>
<p>atrial fibrillation or SVT super</p>
<p>ventricular tachycardias those a little</p>
<p>more serious because those aren&rsquo;t just a</p>
<p>nuisance of a feeling but those actually</p>
<p>have other health concerns and</p>
<p>repercussions down the road so even more</p>
<p>so I will reply make sure their</p>
<p>electrolytes are replenished for those</p>
<p>situations and also interestingly how</p>
<p>lifestyle plays into this I mean the</p>
<p>risk factors for afib or being</p>
<p>overweight having high blood pressure</p>
<p>not exercising and having a high sugar</p>
<p>high carb diet can play into all that</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s why when people ask me</p>
<p>does a low carb diet treat atrial</p>
<p>fibrillation well I I can&rsquo;t say that it</p>
<p>specifically treats the the electricity</p>
<p>imbalance I guess for the electricity</p>
<p>short-circuit but what it does do is it</p>
<p>treats every single one of the risk</p>
<p>factors for an e-fit and therefore it</p>
<p>can certainly make it less likely to</p>
<p>happen I mean I may need to think about</p>
<p>it magnesium where do you get magnesium</p>
<p>well leafy greens and I mean it&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of a you need some you need some</p>
<p>vegetables and people don&rsquo;t consume a</p>
<p>lot of those but on top of that you have</p>
<p>insulin resistance which which just for</p>
<p>the Faculty of insulin resistance the</p>
<p>majority population you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>be able to absorb the amount of</p>
<p>magnesium or potassium you once did so I</p>
<p>think just my own viewpoint this is my</p>
<p>guess I think it&rsquo;s partly not consuming</p>
<p>the right foods but partly the insulin</p>
<p>resistance even if you do consume and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going in like it should so you</p>
<p>have to do more next up yeah interesting</p>
<p>point</p>
<p>yeah what about dumb he have you ever</p>
<p>run into a situation where you assess</p>
<p>someone with angina and their arteries</p>
<p>are clear sure yeah yeah so there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>condition called syndrome X or micro</p>
<p>vascular disease it&rsquo;s got a number of</p>
<p>different names where sometimes then the</p>
<p>main arteries look clear but the very</p>
<p>distal arteries that you can&rsquo;t see very</p>
<p>well could have a plaque buildup or even</p>
<p>the arteries could be spasming and that</p>
<p>those can both cause angina</p>
<p>so you know the treatment cardiologists</p>
<p>tend to lose interest then because the</p>
<p>treatment is no longer stents is no</p>
<p>longer these cool procedures we have to</p>
<p>open up arteries but treatment then is</p>
<p>focusing on lifestyle maybe some</p>
<p>medications</p>
<p>maybe stress management maybe</p>
<p>electrolyte replacement you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s getting a little more detailed</p>
<p>in actually more challenging than just</p>
<p>going in and putting it in the stent so</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a lot more involved from that</p>
<p>standpoint but it&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>happens quite frequently yeah Wow and</p>
<p>then from your experience your you have</p>
<p>a chance to you know try different diets</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re obviously right now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you just basically stumbled or research</p>
<p>and found low-carb is really effective</p>
<p>for your clients what from a</p>
<p>cardiovascular standpoint are you just</p>
<p>finding like they&rsquo;re responding way</p>
<p>better than the other diets I mean I</p>
<p>just want to kind of just get you</p>
<p>touched on it but I just wanted to know</p>
<p>what type of effects are you finding</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re coaching these people that</p>
<p>had I&rsquo;m sure that you probably do most</p>
<p>people you&rsquo;re coaching if cardiovascular</p>
<p>issues I&rsquo;m guessing and then you coach</p>
<p>them you change their diet and then you</p>
<p>see changes yeah so there&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>mix of people I&rsquo;m coaching a number are</p>
<p>prevention they say I just don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>develop cardiovascular disease or I have</p>
<p>but I have high blood pressure or high</p>
<p>cholesterol or something and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to develop the cardiovascular</p>
<p>disease or I just want to be healthier</p>
<p>so I have that&rsquo;s upset and then I</p>
<p>definitely have the subset of people</p>
<p>with cardiovascular disease already and</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s interesting and this is</p>
<p>one of the challenges when you say how</p>
<p>are they improving how how is our</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease improving well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tough metric and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something really hard to measure because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to do angiograms on</p>
<p>these people on a regular basis because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got risks invasive you could do CT</p>
<p>scans but if you&rsquo;re not gonna really see</p>
<p>progression of plaque to a substantial</p>
<p>amount even these studies in the past</p>
<p>that say you know vegan diets have shown</p>
<p>your regression effect it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>inconsequential change and in the plaque</p>
<p>volume that really by today&rsquo;s standards</p>
<p>would not be something of real interest</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s gotta be hard to show regression</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where I like this test the</p>
<p>carotid into</p>
<p>Media things see int it&rsquo;s a specialized</p>
<p>ultrasound of your carotid artery that</p>
<p>measures the thickness of the wall</p>
<p>essentially of that artery it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>knocked down a little bit as a test</p>
<p>because when you compare it head-to-head</p>
<p>with a calcium score the calcium score</p>
<p>has much better predictive value but</p>
<p>where I think the CI MT has its value is</p>
<p>following it over time whatever your</p>
<p>initial value is okay you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>react too strongly at that value but</p>
<p>what happens over the next six months to</p>
<p>two years</p>
<p>is it thickening or is it actually</p>
<p>thinning and regressing and you can see</p>
<p>these dynamic changes much more clearly</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one marker you can use and I</p>
<p>have seen some impressive results in a</p>
<p>number of patients when they go Lokar</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not seen severe progression in</p>
<p>almost anybody most people probably stay</p>
<p>the same but then you look at all the</p>
<p>other risk factors in the market what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their blood pressure what&rsquo;s their waist</p>
<p>circumference what&rsquo;s their metabolic</p>
<p>health from an insulin and glucose</p>
<p>standpoint whether they&rsquo;re inflammatory</p>
<p>markers doing in granted these do not</p>
<p>guarantee that their cardiovascular</p>
<p>disease and their vessels are improving</p>
<p>but these are the best markers and</p>
<p>predictors we have to say what kind of</p>
<p>impact are you having on your overall</p>
<p>health and as I&rsquo;m sure you know is a low</p>
<p>carb diet the majority of those improve</p>
<p>oh yeah absolutely</p>
<p>you know Dave Feldman right of course</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s great so Dave Dave talks about he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a human guinea pig and he he went</p>
<p>off the keto plan okay for six weeks I</p>
<p>think it was and he showed before and</p>
<p>after his art is I think I guess his</p>
<p>arteries and his the coronary another</p>
<p>core the carotid thickened did you ever</p>
<p>hear that story yes see IMT went up</p>
<p>significantly when he went on his sort</p>
<p>of hook high carb standard American</p>
<p>style diet not scary it was scary to see</p>
<p>yeah no quick I mean like this is what</p>
<p>happens right someone does keto and run</p>
<p>around Thanksgiving they go off keto</p>
<p>until New Year&rsquo;s right so they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to go off a bit and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just clogging your arteries or</p>
<p>these thickening your arteries and</p>
<p>obstructing blood flow to your brain</p>
<p>right right so important to</p>
<p>differentiate that does not mean a</p>
<p>plaque right clogged in the artery but</p>
<p>that is an early sign of vascular</p>
<p>disease vascular damage and the natural</p>
<p>progression is down the road to develop</p>
<p>another especially since you&rsquo;re setting</p>
<p>yourself up for inflammation internally</p>
<p>in that from an information you have all</p>
<p>this healing this patching effect of all</p>
<p>the other things that can then create</p>
<p>the the plaque right right exactly and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you know and that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>people who I work with I I counsel them</p>
<p>saying look we don&rsquo;t have 20-year data</p>
<p>to say this diet is going to reverse</p>
<p>your arterial disease but what we have</p>
<p>for all these tests that we can measure</p>
<p>to show that they are improving or if</p>
<p>someone comes to me with an LDL of 250</p>
<p>and says my doctor says this is killing</p>
<p>me and I say look there is another</p>
<p>perspective here the other perspective</p>
<p>is we measure all these other tests and</p>
<p>follow them to see if we have any sign</p>
<p>of progression or worsening of vascular</p>
<p>disease if we do okay then we better</p>
<p>react to that pretty seriously if we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t then we continue to have this</p>
<p>conversation of well what kind of</p>
<p>evidence we have that this is helping</p>
<p>what kind of evidence we have that is</p>
<p>hurting because it&rsquo;s the overall health</p>
<p>and life of people that were concerned</p>
<p>about not a specific number exactly well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to have you come out</p>
<p>and share some more in-depth information</p>
<p>at our summit last last year we had a</p>
<p>500 we&rsquo;re gonna have a thousand people</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be actually shocked just to</p>
<p>the quality of these people&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s such an incredible group of</p>
<p>wonderful people that are actually the</p>
<p>watching right now and so we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>make it mandatory that everyone watching</p>
<p>has to come out well I can meet you in</p>
<p>person and have a great time but I think</p>
<p>what you bring to the table is like you</p>
<p>have experience you&rsquo;re in the trenches</p>
<p>you basically you&rsquo;re dealing with the</p>
<p>number one thing that&rsquo;s you know people</p>
<p>die up so I think it&rsquo;s going to be very</p>
<p>valuable so how do you share your data</p>
<p>so I appreciate</p>
<p>you know you spending time in your busy</p>
<p>schedule now just just it did this</p>
<p>interview but it will definitely do some</p>
<p>more as well great I appreciate the</p>
<p>opportunity I really look forward to</p>
<p>that conference later this year thank</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind to give me a thumbs</p>
<p>up and like this video I&rsquo;d really</p>
<p>appreciate it</p>
