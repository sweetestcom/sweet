<p>Tim Cook: Good morning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so glad you could join us.</p>
<p>At Apple, we&rsquo;re fortunate to be surrounded by people</p>
<p>who strive to innovate together</p>
<p>to create products and experiences that enrich people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>products that are intuitive and easy to use,</p>
<p>that have a unique integration of hardware and software,</p>
<p>and that are incredibly personal.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re here to talk about three products</p>
<p>that have become essential in our lives:</p>
<p>iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always with you,</p>
<p>useful whenever and wherever you need them,</p>
<p>and are designed to work seamlessly together.</p>
<p>On their own, each is industry leading.</p>
<p>Together, they provide a magical experience.</p>
<p>With one tap, AirPods are instantly set up</p>
<p>and ready to work with your iPhone and Apple Watch,</p>
<p>and automatic switching allows sound to move seamlessly</p>
<p>between any of your Apple devices.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also incredible integration between iPhone and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Together they provide the convenience of having your notifications</p>
<p>and messages on your wrist and available with just a glance.</p>
<p>You can seamlessly hand off phone calls between your iPhone and Apple Watch,</p>
<p>and you can set your destination on your iPhone</p>
<p>and your Apple Watch will help guide you along the way.</p>
<p>Users can even get their health and fitness data from Apple Watch</p>
<p>and see it on the Health app on their iPhone.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of the unique and powerful ways</p>
<p>our hardware and software are designed to work together,</p>
<p>enhancing and enriching the experiences you have with these products.</p>
<p>This type of integration is something only Apple can do.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to make these products and these experiences</p>
<p>even better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started by talking about Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Apple Watch has become an essential companion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always with you, allowing you to do so much right from your wrist.</p>
<p>It keeps you connected to the things you care about most,</p>
<p>encourages you to stay active, and monitors your health</p>
<p>and gets help when you need it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve received thousands of letters from customers</p>
<p>writing about their personal experiences using Apple Watch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share just a few of those stories with you now.</p>
<p>Dear, Mr. Cook&hellip;</p>
<p>Dear, Tim&hellip;</p>
<p>Dear, Mr. Cook&hellip;</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Cook&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing to you from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing you from Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>I am a 27-year-old high school teacher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a senior in high school.</p>
<p>I only had the watch for two or three weeks.</p>
<p>I was viewing a movie with my wife in our family room&hellip;</p>
<p>I was having lunch at one of the spiciest restaurants in San Diego&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a typical summer night.</p>
<p>I looked around the corner,</p>
<p>and a bear was staring right at me.</p>
<p>I was doing what we call a dump and return</p>
<p>when I slipped headfirst into the compactor.</p>
<p>I was skating on a frozen river when the ice gave out.</p>
<p>The door closed, and everything went dark.</p>
<p>My longtime friend started grasping his chest.</p>
<p>I was fighting to catch my breath.</p>
<p>I used the watch to study my pulse, and it was wildly erratic.</p>
<p>Things escalated quickly from there.</p>
<p>I was getting tired, and I could tell hypothermia was setting in.</p>
<p>I go to grab my phone, but my pockets were empty.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have my phone on me.</p>
<p>As I was trying to figure out what to do,</p>
<p>I looked down and saw my watch.</p>
<p>I placed my Apple Watch on his wrist,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes.</p>
<p>An atrial fibrillation notification popped up.</p>
<p>Holy cow.</p>
<p>Holy moly.</p>
<p>I looked down at my Apple Watch,</p>
<p>and my heart rate was 187 beats per minute.</p>
<p>I drove him to the hospital where he was treated for a heart condition</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t aware he had.</p>
<p>Dear, Apple,</p>
<p>my dad was flying our small plane to Vermont.</p>
<p>I was asleep in the backseat.</p>
<p>I woke up when we were crashing into the tops of the trees.</p>
<p>The plane broke into six pieces,</p>
<p>and we were miles away from civilization in the freezing cold.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>my Apple Watch started ringing.</p>
<p>I forgot I was wearing it.</p>
<p>I told my grandma that I&rsquo;d have to call her back,</p>
<p>and I immediately called 911.</p>
<p>I whispered to my co-teacher,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to go to the emergency room right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were advised to head directly to the emergency room.</p>
<p>I held down the button and whispered, &ldquo;Siri, call 911.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dialed 911, and that sucker started ringing,</p>
<p>and I was smiling like a brand-new baby.</p>
<p>Rescuers arrived in minutes.</p>
<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t had the Apple Watch, things could have been much worse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so grateful.</p>
<p>From now on, I&rsquo;ll never leave the house without it.</p>
<p>My doctor said, &ldquo;It was your watch that saved your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks for helping save my friend&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Since the heart event was without other symptoms,</p>
<p>clearly, the watch was my only call to action</p>
<p>and my only link to the fine medical care that saved my life.</p>
<p>With deep gratitude, Erik.</p>
<p>Thank you, Hannah.</p>
<p>Sinceramente, Marcos.</p>
<p>Bill.</p>
<p>Taryn.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Dr. Korn.</p>
<p>All the best, Shaae.</p>
<p>There are so many ways Apple Watch improves peoples&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>These are the reasons we do what we do.</p>
<p>And this year we&rsquo;re introducing our best Apple Watch lineup yet,</p>
<p>by far!</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Jeff.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Jeff Williams: Each year, Apple Watch sets a new standard</p>
<p>for what a smartwatch should be.</p>
<p>And this continuous innovation has made it the number-one-selling smartwatch</p>
<p>in the world for seven years running.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re so excited about what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>This is the new Apple Watch Series 8.</p>
<p>It has all of the things you love about Apple Watch plus even more.</p>
<p>Series 8 is beautifully designed</p>
<p>and packed with the most advanced sensors and technology.</p>
<p>It features a big, brilliant, Always-On display with narrow borders</p>
<p>that push the screen right to the edge.</p>
<p>Detailed watch faces like the new Lunar, Astronomy,</p>
<p>Metropolitan, and Modular look stunning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so bright that text and complications are easy to read</p>
<p>even when your wrist is down.</p>
<p>And Series 8 is durable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s swim proof, dust proof, and crack resistant.</p>
<p>To tell you more about Series 8, here&rsquo;s Deidre.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Deidre Caldbeck: Series 8 is designed to keep you connected</p>
<p>to the people and things that you care about most.</p>
<p>It motivates you to stay active and fit.</p>
<p>With Workouts and Fitness+ there are so many ways to exercise using Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Series 8 helps keep you safe with fall detection,</p>
<p>emergency SOS, and Medical ID.</p>
<p>It has sleep tracking, Cycle Tracking, and Mindfulness</p>
<p>to give you insights into your body and help you maintain healthy habits.</p>
<p>With best-in-class health sensors that enable ECG,</p>
<p>irregular rhythm notifications, and blood oxygen,</p>
<p>it is the ultimate device for a healthy life.</p>
<p>And now, Series 8 brings even more features</p>
<p>for health, safety, and connectivity,</p>
<p>starting with an innovative new temperature sensor</p>
<p>that takes our commitment to women&rsquo;s health even further.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Sumbul to tell you about it.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Dr. Sumbul Ahmad Desai: Women&rsquo;s health impacts more than just women.</p>
<p>It also impacts their families and communities.</p>
<p>And menstrual cycles are key to a woman&rsquo;s health,</p>
<p>so much so that many physicians regard them as a vital sign.</p>
<p>We added Cycle Tracking three years ago,</p>
<p>and it has helped tens of millions gain deeper insights</p>
<p>into their cycles and overall health.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re introducing a suite of advanced Cycle Tracking features,</p>
<p>including valuable information about a critical aspect of women&rsquo;s health:</p>
<p>ovulation.</p>
<p>As always, we build our health features with two fundamental principles.</p>
<p>First, they&rsquo;re developed using scientifically validated insights,</p>
<p>and second, privacy is at the core,</p>
<p>designed to keep your data secure and private.</p>
<p>Utilizing the new temperature sensor in Apple Watch Series 8,</p>
<p>you can now receive a retrospective estimate of when you ovulated.</p>
<p>Series 8 has a unique two-sensor design.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one temperature sensor on the back crystal, near your skin,</p>
<p>and another just under the display.</p>
<p>This design improves accuracy by reducing bias</p>
<p>from the outside environment.</p>
<p>Nighttime wrist temperature can be a good indicator</p>
<p>of overall body temperature</p>
<p>because while you sleep, your blood vessels dilate,</p>
<p>increasing blood flow to your limbs.</p>
<p>Overnight, Series 8 samples your wrist temperature every 5 seconds</p>
<p>and it can detect changes as small as 0.1° Celsius.</p>
<p>In the Health app,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to see nightly shifts from your baseline temperature,</p>
<p>which can be caused by things like exercise, jet lag,</p>
<p>alcohol, or illness.</p>
<p>But tracking temperature changes is even more useful for those who ovulate,</p>
<p>because cyclical patterns can reveal the biphasic shift.</p>
<p>The biphasic shift is an increase in body temperature that occurs in response</p>
<p>to changing hormones, and it can indicate ovulation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to conceive, knowing if and when you ovulated</p>
<p>can inform your family planning</p>
<p>and conversations with your health care provider.</p>
<p>Today, the most common way to track the biphasic shift</p>
<p>is manually with a thermometer and a journal.</p>
<p>Series 8 makes this much easier and more convenient</p>
<p>by providing new, automatic retrospective ovulation estimates.</p>
<p>Further advancing Cycle Tracking,</p>
<p>all users on iOS 16 and watchOS 9 can be now notified</p>
<p>of possible cycle deviations based on logged cycle data.</p>
<p>You may not realize that common cycle deviations, like persistent spotting</p>
<p>or prolonged periods, can be symptoms of serious health conditions</p>
<p>like fibroids, thyroid disorders, or PCOS.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to know when they occur.</p>
<p>The temperature sensing capability on Series 8, plus heart rate,</p>
<p>and logged cycle data come together to give you a detailed view of your cycle,</p>
<p>all of which can be easily shared with your healthcare provider</p>
<p>to facilitate more informed conversations.</p>
<p>We believe privacy is a fundamental human right</p>
<p>and that your health data is yours and yours alone.</p>
<p>Your Cycle Tracking data is encrypted on your device</p>
<p>and only accessible with your passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID.</p>
<p>When using iOS and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication</p>
<p>and a passcode,</p>
<p>Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end,</p>
<p>meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data</p>
<p>and therefore cannot read it.</p>
<p>Only with your explicit permission can your health data be shared.</p>
<p>And you have granular control over the types of data you share</p>
<p>and who you share it with.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s health is critically important,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re proud to bring these new advanced cycle tracking capabilities</p>
<p>to Apple Watch Series 8.</p>
<p>Now back to Deidre.</p>
<p>Deidre: Safety features on Apple Watch,</p>
<p>like fall detection and emergency SOS, have helped save lives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another emergency situation you never want to find yourself in,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a car crash.</p>
<p>According to the US Department of Transportation,</p>
<p>almost half of the worst crashes occur in rural areas,</p>
<p>and the majority involve only a single vehicle.</p>
<p>So we built an innovative new feature to help in situations like this.</p>
<p>Introducing Crash Detection.</p>
<p>Apple Watch Series 8 can detect if you were in a severe car crash.</p>
<p>When a crash is detected, it will automatically connect you</p>
<p>with emergency services,</p>
<p>provide your location, and notify your emergency contacts.</p>
<p>And to tell you more, here&rsquo;s Ron.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Ron Huang: In order to detect the unique forces of a car crash,</p>
<p>we developed two new motion sensors for Series 8:</p>
<p>an improved 3-axis gyroscope</p>
<p>and a high-g-force accelerometer.</p>
<p>The new accelerometer is capable of measuring up to 256 g&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>allowing it to detect the extreme impacts of a crash.</p>
<p>And it samples motion four times faster– at over 3,000 times a second–</p>
<p>so it can sense the precise moment of impact.</p>
<p>With these new technologies,</p>
<p>we built an advanced sensor fusion algorithm</p>
<p>to deliver accurate Crash Detection.</p>
<p>We started by spending years studying vehicle impacts</p>
<p>at state-of-the-art crash test labs.</p>
<p>We focused on four main types of severe crashes:</p>
<p>front impact, side impact,</p>
<p>rear-end collision, and rollovers.</p>
<p>In each crash test, we captured data from the new gyroscope</p>
<p>and accelerometer as well as from other sensors in Series 8</p>
<p>including the barometer, microphone, and GPS.</p>
<p>And then we used machine learning to incorporate all of these signals</p>
<p>into the algorithm,</p>
<p>which was trained on over 1 million hours</p>
<p>of real-world driving and crash data.</p>
<p>Series 8 can detect crashes in the most popular types of vehicles</p>
<p>like passenger cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks.</p>
<p>Crash Detection runs only when you&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>and processes data only around the time of a possible crash,</p>
<p>entirely on your device.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Crash Detection on Apple Watch Series 8.</p>
<p>We truly hope you never need it,</p>
<p>but that you will feel a little bit safer every time you get in the car.</p>
<p>Now, back to Deidre.</p>
<p>Deidre: Even with the new temperature and motion sensors working in the background,</p>
<p>Apple Watch Series 8 still has all-day, 18-hour battery life.</p>
<p>But sometimes, like if you&rsquo;re on a long flight</p>
<p>or without a charger for the night,</p>
<p>you need to preserve battery life.</p>
<p>To help with that, we&rsquo;re introducing Low Power Mode,</p>
<p>which can give you up to 36 hours of battery life on a full charge.</p>
<p>Low Power Mode maintains many of the core features of Apple Watch–</p>
<p>like activity tracking and fall detection–</p>
<p>while temporarily disabling other features,</p>
<p>like Always-On display and auto workout detection,</p>
<p>providing maximum battery savings with the least impact to the user experience.</p>
<p>Low Power Mode is available on Series 4 and later running watchOS 9.</p>
<p>Cellular models of Series 8 will also support international roaming.</p>
<p>Apple Watch will now be able to stay connected to your cellular network</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re traveling abroad.</p>
<p>Simply add your Apple Watch to your iPhone roaming plan at little or no cost.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, international roaming will be available</p>
<p>on more than 30 carriers worldwide.</p>
<p>It will be supported on all cellular models of Apple Watch</p>
<p>from Series 5 onward running watchOS 9.</p>
<p>Apple Watch Series 8 will be available in four colors of 100% recycled aluminum:</p>
<p>Midnight, Starlight,</p>
<p>Silver, and Product(RED),</p>
<p>and in three stainless steel finishes: Silver, Gold, and Graphite.</p>
<p>There are also great new colors across our most popular band styles.</p>
<p>We also have exciting updates to both Nike bands,</p>
<p>including fresh colors for the Nike Sport Band</p>
<p>and a new Nike Sport Loop &ldquo;Just Do It&rdquo; woven</p>
<p>right into the textile.</p>
<p>And with watchOS 9,</p>
<p>you can use all Nike watch faces</p>
<p>with any Apple Watch.</p>
<p>There are also two stylish new bands for Apple Watch Hermès.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H Diagonal&rdquo; uses hundreds of micro-perforations</p>
<p>to create a sporty pattern of the iconic Hermès H.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Gourmette Metal&rdquo; features a polished silver chain</p>
<p>wrapping twice around the wrist for a bold look.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a new &ldquo;Hermès Lucky Horse&rdquo; watch face</p>
<p>that celebrates their equestrian roots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the incredible new Apple Watch Series 8</p>
<p>with temperature sensing, retrospective ovulation estimates,</p>
<p>Crash Detection, and international roaming,</p>
<p>on top of best-in-class health features</p>
<p>like Blood Oxygen, ECG, and sleep tracking.</p>
<p>It has the latest design that users love with an edge-to-edge display,</p>
<p>great durability, and fast charging,</p>
<p>and all the new features of watchOS 9.</p>
<p>Apple Watch Series 8 will start at $399 for GPS</p>
<p>and $499 for cellular.</p>
<p>And with the purchase of any new Apple Watch,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll also get 3 months of Fitness+ free.</p>
<p>You can order today, and it will be available September 16th.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Apple Watch Series 8.</p>
<p>Now back to Jeff.</p>
<p>Jeff: I am so incredibly excited about Series 8.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take one more look at this amazing watch.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve taken up running.</p>
<p>Apple Watch has taken up a few new things as well.</p>
<p>First, it tracked your distance. Now, it&rsquo;s tracking your stride length.</p>
<p>It learns your favorite route, then lets you race against yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re behind.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re behind.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re swimming,</p>
<p>it can tell a breaststroke</p>
<p>from a backstroke</p>
<p>from a kickboard.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>it dries itself off.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a dream. Your watch can take an ECG.</p>
<p>But if it was a dream,</p>
<p>that watch would track your REM sleep down to the minute.</p>
<p>It checks your heart rate.</p>
<p>It checks for temperature changes to estimate when you&rsquo;ve ovulated.</p>
<p>It checks out when you&rsquo;re buying spaghetti.</p>
<p>It could already detect if you fell.</p>
<p>Now the microphone detects impact noise,</p>
<p>the accelerometer senses rapid deceleration,</p>
<p>and the barometer measures a shift in pressure</p>
<p>consistent with an air bag going off.</p>
<p>So it can check if you need help after a car crash.</p>
<p>And hey, it also shows your ground contact time.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Have a nice run.</p>
<p>Jeff: Next, let&rsquo;s talk about Apple Watch SE.</p>
<p>SE has been a huge hit,</p>
<p>and for more than 80% of SE customers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s their very first Apple Watch.</p>
<p>They love how SE delivers the core Apple Watch experience</p>
<p>at a more affordable price.</p>
<p>SE is a fantastic way to get started with Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And this year, it gets even better.</p>
<p>The new SE will be available in Silver, Midnight, and Starlight–</p>
<p>all in 100% recycled aluminum.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve completely redesigned the back case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now made of nylon composite materials</p>
<p>that match perfectly with the three case finishes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a new production process that reduces its carbon footprint</p>
<p>by over 80%.</p>
<p>Now, back to Deidre to tell you more.</p>
<p>Deidre: The second generation SE continues to deliver the core benefits</p>
<p>of Apple Watch that users love,</p>
<p>like workout and activity tracking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s swim-proof.</p>
<p>It has high and low heart rate notifications,</p>
<p>emergency SOS,</p>
<p>and fall detection.</p>
<p>SE also includes the same motion sensors as Series 8</p>
<p>to support Crash Detection.</p>
<p>And with AirPods, you can listen to your music anywhere.</p>
<p>The SE display is 30% larger than that of Series 3.</p>
<p>And SE features the same S8 System in Package that&rsquo;s in Series 8,</p>
<p>making it up to 20% faster than before.</p>
<p>SE continues to be the perfect Apple Watch for Family Setup.</p>
<p>With Family Setup, you can use your iPhone to pair watches for your children</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t yet have their own iPhones.</p>
<p>Kids can make phone calls and send messages to contacts that you specify,</p>
<p>connect to emergency services, and share their location.</p>
<p>And with new features coming soon like the Home app and home keys in Wallet,</p>
<p>Family Setup allows even more independence for kids</p>
<p>and more peace of mind for parents.</p>
<p>SE offers everyone the core features of Apple Watch,</p>
<p>and now includes the faster S8 SiP,</p>
<p>Crash Detection, new case colors with matching back cases,</p>
<p>and all the new capabilities of watchOS 9,</p>
<p>all at a more affordable price starting at $249 for GPS</p>
<p>and $299 for cellular.</p>
<p>You can order it today and it will be available on September 16th.</p>
<p>We are so excited about the great new features coming to Series 8</p>
<p>and Apple Watch SE, and can&rsquo;t wait for people to start using them.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not done yet.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Jeff to tell you even more.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Jeff: We&rsquo;ve been working on something completely new.</p>
<p>Over the years, we&rsquo;ve spoken to acclaimed explorers,</p>
<p>accomplished adventurers, and elite athletes</p>
<p>who are drawn to some of the most extreme environments–</p>
<p>like Ray Zahab, an extreme explorer</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s crossed some of the harshest environments on foot,</p>
<p>including the length of the Sahara Desert,</p>
<p>and expeditions across Antarctica and the Arctic,</p>
<p>and Nadia Aly– an accomplished diver,</p>
<p>expedition leader and renowned underwater photographer,</p>
<p>and Scott Jurek–one of the most dominant ultra-marathon runners in history</p>
<p>and a seven-time winner of the Western States 100-miler.</p>
<p>Inspired by their stories,</p>
<p>we set out to create an Apple Watch</p>
<p>designed specifically for exploration, adventure, and endurance,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s extraordinary.</p>
<p>This has been years in the making,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait to show it to you.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Wanted for hazardous journey&hellip;</p>
<p>long months of complete darkness&hellip;</p>
<p>Bitter cold,</p>
<p>constant danger,</p>
<p>safe return&hellip; doubtful.</p>
<p>Honor and recognition in case of success.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Jeff: This is Apple Watch Ultra,</p>
<p>a completely new design reimagined with extraordinary new capabilities</p>
<p>that expand the ways you can use Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Every detail has been engineered to create the most rugged</p>
<p>and capable Apple Watch ever.</p>
<p>It starts with the case,</p>
<p>made from aerospace grade titanium</p>
<p>that strikes the perfect balance of weight,</p>
<p>durability, and corrosion resistance.</p>
<p>The titanium case extends up to surround the flat sapphire front crystal,</p>
<p>protecting it from edge impacts that can occur during extreme activities.</p>
<p>And at the center of the 49mm case is our biggest, brightest display</p>
<p>ever in Apple Watch,</p>
<p>making it easier to read in the harshest sunlight.</p>
<p>We also added a new button– the Action button–</p>
<p>in high-contrast &ldquo;international orange&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s customizable and gives users quick physical control for a range of functions.</p>
<p>The Digital Crown has a larger diameter</p>
<p>and coarser grooves,</p>
<p>and the side button stands proud of the case,</p>
<p>both designed to be used while wearing gloves.</p>
<p>And the audio system excels when you&rsquo;re out in the elements.</p>
<p>We added a second speaker for increased volume.</p>
<p>Three strategically placed microphones and advanced software</p>
<p>help ensure voice clarity on calls, even in windy conditions.</p>
<p>And for maximum connectivity and communication,</p>
<p>cellular is built into every Apple Watch Ultra.</p>
<p>Ultra has the biggest battery of any Apple Watch yet.</p>
<p>It gets up to 36 hours of battery life on a single charge.</p>
<p>And Apple Watch Ultra can even get up to 60 hours of battery life</p>
<p>for a multi-day adventure</p>
<p>using a new battery optimization setting</p>
<p>coming later this fall.</p>
<p>And to complement the rugged utility of the hardware,</p>
<p>we created our most technical face yet:</p>
<p>Wayfinder.</p>
<p>With a host of critical information, it includes a compass in the dial</p>
<p>and can be customized for the mountain, ocean, or trail.</p>
<p>And to optimize for evening conditions, there&rsquo;s Night mode.</p>
<p>Just rotate the Crown, and the UI turns red</p>
<p>for better visibility in the dark.</p>
<p>Apple Watch Ultra is designed to push boundaries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a versatile tool for anyone who appreciates outdoor adventure,</p>
<p>water sports, and endurance training.</p>
<p>And for each of these, we created a special band</p>
<p>as meticulously crafted as the watch itself.</p>
<p>With explorers in mind, we developed the Alpine Loop.</p>
<p>The titanium G-hook securely fastens through the reinforced top loops.</p>
<p>The band is woven using an innovative process</p>
<p>that integrates the two layers without any stitching.</p>
<p>The Ocean Band is molded in a high-performance elastomer</p>
<p>with a tubular geometry, allowing it to stretch for a perfect fit,</p>
<p>even over a wetsuit.</p>
<p>The titanium buckle and adjustable loops</p>
<p>secure the band during high-speed water sports.</p>
<p>For endurance athletes, we created the Trail Loop.</p>
<p>The lightweight textile has increased elasticity</p>
<p>for a comfortable, snug fit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our thinnest band yet,</p>
<p>with a convenient tab for making quick adjustments.</p>
<p>Ultra is a totally new expression of Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re an accomplished athlete or explorer</p>
<p>or aspire to try exciting new activities,</p>
<p>we think you&rsquo;re gonna love it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Julz to tell you more.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Julz Arney: We set out to make Apple Watch Ultra</p>
<p>the best sport watch out there,</p>
<p>with features for every athlete.</p>
<p>GPS performance is critical for serious runners and athletes</p>
<p>who want the most accurate metrics.</p>
<p>A typical GPS solution works well most of the time,</p>
<p>but some environments are really tricky–</p>
<p>like when tall buildings or dense trees block satellites,</p>
<p>making accurate GPS readings nearly impossible when training and competing.</p>
<p>The famed Chicago Marathon is a great example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a notoriously challenging environment for GPS</p>
<p>because a big portion is run between skyscrapers.</p>
<p>So we designed a new, precision dual-frequency GPS solution</p>
<p>that, in addition to L1,</p>
<p>also includes the latest frequency: L5,</p>
<p>plus new, custom positioning algorithms.</p>
<p>In dense urban conditions like this,</p>
<p>Apple Watch Ultra provides the most accurate GPS</p>
<p>of any sport watch in the market.</p>
<p>We also brought some great workout updates to watchOS 9</p>
<p>inspired by high-performance athletes,</p>
<p>with new metrics, views, and experiences</p>
<p>like vertical oscillation, heart rate zones, and custom workouts.</p>
<p>And now, with the addition of the Action button on Apple Watch Ultra,</p>
<p>you can make the workout experience more powerful and more precise.</p>
<p>Press the Action button</p>
<p>for the most accurate start to your workout.</p>
<p>For triathletes and duathletes, the Action button lets you instantly transition</p>
<p>from one leg of your race to the next.</p>
<p>And later this year, we&rsquo;re enabling a new feature</p>
<p>which automatically detects when you arrive at a running track,</p>
<p>ensuring the most accurate pace and distance.</p>
<p>The Action button lets you conveniently mark a segment</p>
<p>with a single press for the ultimate track-running experience.</p>
<p>For endurance athletes, the bigger battery makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Of course, you can easily complete a marathon with battery life to spare.</p>
<p>Using the new low-power workout setting,</p>
<p>most athletes can do a 2.4-mile swim, plus a 112-mile bike ride,</p>
<p>and then run a marathon</p>
<p>to complete a long-distance triathlon with full precision GPS and heart rate.</p>
<p>But Ultra is so much more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to help you explore the most extreme and remote locations,</p>
<p>from freezing-cold mountains at -20° Celsius</p>
<p>to the blazing desert heat at 55° Celsius,</p>
<p>or 130° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>When navigating in the backcountry, a compass is an essential tool.</p>
<p>So we completely redesigned the Compass app</p>
<p>with new precision views and added capabilities.</p>
<p>The orienteering view includes Compass Waypoints to mark a position–</p>
<p>like the location of the trailhead or your tent–</p>
<p>and they can be quickly added using the Action button.</p>
<p>And if you get lost or disoriented,</p>
<p>Backtrack uses GPS data to create a path of where you&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>so you can easily retrace your steps.</p>
<p>And it turns on automatically in the background when you go off the grid,</p>
<p>just in case.</p>
<p>Getting help when you need it is critical,</p>
<p>especially in the backcountry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Apple Watch Ultra has a built-in 86 decibel siren</p>
<p>that you can activate using the Action button.</p>
<p>It has a unique sound pattern that alerts others to your location</p>
<p>up to 600 feet, or 180 meters, away.</p>
<p>Finally, Apple Watch Ultra has been designed for water sports.</p>
<p>It can withstand the intense dynamic forces of activities</p>
<p>like kitesurfing and wakeboarding,</p>
<p>and it can go deep below the waves</p>
<p>because we engineered it to twice the water resistance, WR100.</p>
<p>Using its new built-in depth gauge, Ultra automatically launches</p>
<p>a new Depth app when submerged</p>
<p>to show current depth, underwater time, and water temperature.</p>
<p>We also want Ultra to be a great tool for recreational scuba divers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been certified to EN 13319,</p>
<p>the internationally recognized standard for dive computers and gauges.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re partnering with Huish Outdoors</p>
<p>to create an exclusive app that turns Apple Watch Ultra</p>
<p>into a capable dive computer for recreational scuba diving</p>
<p>to the depth of 40 meters, or 130 feet.</p>
<p>To tell you more about this incredible app,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Mike Huish, CEO of Huish Outdoors.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Mike Huish: Our company is world-renowned</p>
<p>for powering every aspect of the underwater experience.</p>
<p>And Oceanic has been a leading innovator in scuba diving for over 50 years,</p>
<p>introducing some of the very first dive computers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thrilled to announce our new Oceanic+ app for Apple Watch Ultra.</p>
<p>This is so exciting for anyone interested in scuba diving</p>
<p>because now the same watch you wear every day is also your dive computer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed Oceanic+ with all the key features</p>
<p>for recreational scuba divers and free divers.</p>
<p>And it works seamlessly with our iPhone app to plan your dives.</p>
<p>Our dive planner calculates depth and time,</p>
<p>and integrates dive conditions like tides,</p>
<p>water temperature, and even up-to-date information from the community,</p>
<p>like visibility and currents.</p>
<p>The best way to experience this is on a real dive,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s get in the water.</p>
<p>Your dive metrics are all simple and easy to read</p>
<p>on the large, bright display.</p>
<p>Our app runs the Bühlmann decompression algorithm,</p>
<p>which constantly calculates and monitors dive parameters.</p>
<p>So from the moment you start a dive,</p>
<p>all critical information is just a glance away.</p>
<p>And unlike most dive computers, which require you to perform</p>
<p>a complex sequence of button presses to find the information you need,</p>
<p>our app uses simple gestures.</p>
<p>Rotate the Digital Crown to access additional screens</p>
<p>or press the Action button to set a compass heading.</p>
<p>Oceanic+ provides all of the safety warnings that you would expect</p>
<p>from the most advanced dive computers today,</p>
<p>like decompression limits, excessive ascent rate,</p>
<p>and at the end of your dive, safety stop guidance</p>
<p>all smartly color-coded to help make complex information</p>
<p>easy to understand.</p>
<p>Right after the dive, your data–including your GPS entry and exit location–</p>
<p>automatically syncs to your iPhone and the cloud,</p>
<p>where you can see a summary of your dive profile.</p>
<p>And in your logbook, you can sort and search past dives,</p>
<p>and instantly share your adventures with family and friends,</p>
<p>as well as the community.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait for you to try it out later this fall.</p>
<p>The Oceanic+ app and Apple Watch Ultra together create a powerful</p>
<p>and easy-to-use dive computer that will inspire more people</p>
<p>to discover and explore the underwater world.</p>
<p>Now back to Jeff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Apple Watch Ultra,</p>
<p>the most rugged and capable Apple Watch ever.</p>
<p>With a 49mm titanium case,</p>
<p>precision dual-frequency GPS,</p>
<p>a customizable Action button, long battery life,</p>
<p>a built-in depth gauge,</p>
<p>the biggest and brightest display– up to 2000 nits–</p>
<p>and all the other great features of Series 8,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s designed to help you run your longest race,</p>
<p>explore the back country, and dive the world&rsquo;s oceans.</p>
<p>And Apple Watch Ultra, as well as our entire watch lineup,</p>
<p>was designed with the environment in mind–</p>
<p>from the use of recycled materials</p>
<p>to suppliers&rsquo; use of clean energy during manufacturing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already carbon neutral for our corporate operations,</p>
<p>and these efforts move us even closer toward our goal</p>
<p>to become carbon neutral for our entire product footprint by 2030.</p>
<p>All models of Apple Watch Ultra will be $799.</p>
<p>You can order it today,</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another look at the all-new Apple Watch Ultra.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Every explorer has a packing list–</p>
<p>the essential tools</p>
<p>for heading out into the unknown.</p>
<p>We put as many of those tools on your wrist as we could.</p>
<p>The result&hellip;</p>
<p>was the new Apple Watch Ultra.</p>
<p>Ultra&rsquo;s design pushes the boundaries</p>
<p>so you can do the same.</p>
<p>The rugged, yet lightweight, titanium case extends</p>
<p>to protect the flat sapphire crystal</p>
<p>and can endure temperatures that fall below zero</p>
<p>or climb 130° above it.</p>
<p>Into the unknown, you&rsquo;ll want the battery to last for days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Ultra was built with a larger battery</p>
<p>for multi-day use on a single charge.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also need a map.</p>
<p>Or better yet, a dual-frequency GPS</p>
<p>with pinpoint accuracy.</p>
<p>The Compass has been redesigned</p>
<p>and now has waypoint marking and Backtrack,</p>
<p>dropping points along your route to keep you found</p>
<p>when the conditions leave you lost.</p>
<p>A turn of the Crown engages Night mode,</p>
<p>which removes retina-altering blue light</p>
<p>to ease the strain on your eyes in the dark.</p>
<p>Beside the bigger, brighter screen</p>
<p>is its most versatile tool–</p>
<p>a customizable Action button.</p>
<p>One push lets you track race segments,</p>
<p>find a way out,</p>
<p>or start up a dive computer,</p>
<p>which is now strapped to your arm,</p>
<p>tracking everything from depth to water temperature.</p>
<p>The micro-polished sapphire surface and sealed case</p>
<p>result in an Apple Watch twice as water resistant</p>
<p>as any Apple Watch to come before it.</p>
<p>And the audio system&rsquo;s three microphones triangulate</p>
<p>so you can be heard</p>
<p>even in extreme weather.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this matters if it falls off your wrist.</p>
<p>Which is why we&rsquo;ve designed three new bands–</p>
<p>Alpine, Trail, and Ocean–</p>
<p>for specific environments</p>
<p>and maximum comfort,</p>
<p>to endure long runs,</p>
<p>hard falls, and ripping currents.</p>

<p>and a 16-core Neural Engine</p>
<p>that pushes the limits of machine learning.</p>
<p>Since its introduction, A15 continues to be faster</p>
<p>than all the competition at any price.</p>
<p>A15 is essential to iPhone 14.</p>
<p>And with a custom image signal processor,</p>
<p>A15 also powers innovative features in the amazing new camera system.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Caron to tell you more.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Caron Thor: iPhone is always with you</p>
<p>and ready to quickly and effortlessly capture your life&rsquo;s moments.</p>
<p>Last year, over three trillion photos were taken with iPhone!</p>
<p>We develop unique, state-of-the-art camera technology</p>
<p>while staying true to the craft of photography.</p>
<p>Lighting is a fundamental part of getting the best shot possible.</p>
<p>It plays such an important role in capturing everyday memories</p>
<p>and jaw-dropping moments.</p>
<p>iPhone enables gorgeous photo capture across the entire range of light–</p>
<p>from bright light, where colors come alive,</p>
<p>to low light, like indoors,</p>
<p>to nighttime scenes.</p>
<p>And iPhone 14 again sets the standard for photo</p>
<p>and video capture regardless of where you are.</p>
<p>It has a new 12MP Main camera with a larger sensor,</p>
<p>and larger pixels at 1.9 microns.</p>
<p>It has a larger f/1.5 aperture</p>
<p>and sensor-shift OIS</p>
<p>for a powerful Main camera upgrade and takes stunning shots everywhere.</p>
<p>The faster aperture allows better motion freezing,</p>
<p>showing off vibrant colors that bring the scene to life</p>
<p>with great texture and detail.</p>
<p>It delivers a 49% improvement in low light capture,</p>
<p>for more vibrant color and better results in challenging lighting environments,</p>
<p>while making Night mode exposure twice as fast.</p>
<p>And the Ultra Wide camera takes incredible-looking photos and video,</p>
<p>which is great for wider shots and unique perspectives.</p>
<p>The front camera enables great-looking selfies,</p>
<p>high quality video during FaceTime, and so much more.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 has a new TrueDepth camera.</p>
<p>It has a faster f/1.9 aperture</p>
<p>for a 38% improvement in low light capture for photos and video.</p>
<p>The new front camera has autofocus for the first time,</p>
<p>so it can focus clearly at multiple distances.</p>
<p>Together with TrueDepth capabilities,</p>
<p>the front camera now has a hybrid system</p>
<p>that can focus faster, even in low light.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll get better selfies, group shots can be in focus from farther away,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to show off great detail up close.</p>
<p>Low light environments can be a unique challenge with photography.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made incredible progress in capturing in low light over the years</p>
<p>with increasingly larger sensors and faster apertures,</p>
<p>more advanced lenses–</p>
<p>all paired with intelligent software</p>
<p>and our powerful Apple silicon that result in incredible capabilities for low light.</p>
<p>Deep Fusion is a great example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge achievement in computational photography</p>
<p>and uses the powerful Neural Engine</p>
<p>to combine multiple frames into a single image.</p>
<p>This delivers extraordinary detail</p>
<p>and preserves even the subtlest textures in these mid- to lower-light environments.</p>
<p>Now, we are taking our image pipeline further</p>
<p>by applying Deep Fusion much earlier in the process on uncompressed images.</p>
<p>This retains much more information and detail,</p>
<p>and enables rendering of more colors and brighter colors.</p>
<p>This new process unlocks our biggest step forward yet for low light performance.</p>
<p>We call it Photonic Engine.</p>
<p>This is our enhanced image pipeline</p>
<p>that dramatically improves low-light photos.</p>
<p>It goes beyond what hardware alone can provide.</p>
<p>The best part is that it benefits every camera.</p>
<p>When compared to iPhone 13,</p>
<p>it enables photo low light improvement up to two times on the front camera,</p>
<p>two times on the Ultra Wide camera,</p>
<p>and two-and-a-half times on the new Main camera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get photos with much better detail and color,</p>
<p>helping you remember the moment the way you lived it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a big improvement to video this year.</p>
<p>iPhone leads the industry with the highest quality video</p>
<p>and has great stabilization.</p>
<p>It now has a new, even more advanced stabilization mode</p>
<p>that gives users a powerful tool when capturing moments on the move.</p>
<p>This is Action mode.</p>
<p>It uses the full sensor with more overscan and advanced roll correction</p>
<p>to make video look incredibly stable when you&rsquo;re in middle of the action.</p>
<p>Simply toggle it on for great-looking, smooth video,</p>
<p>without having to carry extra gear like a gimbal.</p>
<p>It also supports and Dolby Vision HDR.</p>
<p>The new iPhone 14 camera system is a huge upgrade,</p>
<p>enabling incredible-looking shots across the entire range of shooting conditions.</p>
<p>Back to you, Kaiann.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Kaiann: Now let&rsquo;s talk about connectivity.</p>
<p>iPhone has powerful capabilities</p>
<p>that help our users stay in touch on the go.</p>
<p>This is especially true for 5G, enabling super fast downloads,</p>
<p>better streaming, and real-time connectivity.</p>
<p>And momentum for 5G is stronger than ever,</p>
<p>with over 250 carriers around the world on 5G.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made big improvements to cellular technologies like eSIM,</p>
<p>making it even easier to connect.</p>
<p>An eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates the need for a physical SIM card.</p>
<p>With eSIM, you can quickly transfer an existing cellular plan</p>
<p>or get a new cellular plan, all digitally.</p>
<p>You can even store multiple eSIMs on the same device,</p>
<p>meaning multiple cellular plans and phone numbers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more secure.</p>
<p>Someone can&rsquo;t remove the physical SIM card</p>
<p>if your iPhone is lost or stolen.</p>
<p>eSIM setup is easy.</p>
<p>In just a few simple steps, users are ready to make calls,</p>
<p>send messages, and browse the web.</p>
<p>You can even do this without a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p>Extensive planning and testing with carriers</p>
<p>helped enable the iPhone eSIM experience.</p>
<p>This includes the US, where eSIM support has skyrocketed,</p>
<p>thanks to AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and many more.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, all US models no longer have the SIM tray,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with a physical SIM card anymore.</p>
<p>eSIM provides a simpler way to activate and use iPhone.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about some features</p>
<p>that make iPhone even more essential.</p>
<p>iPhone is there when you need it most.</p>
<p>That confidence is especially important in moments where your safety is at risk.</p>
<p>With iPhone 14, we have two critical new safety features.</p>
<p>It has Crash Detection–</p>
<p>the same feature you just heard about on new Apple Watch models.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 has a new, high dynamic range gyroscope</p>
<p>and a new dual-core accelerometer</p>
<p>that is able to detect up to 256 g&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and it can automatically notify emergency services</p>
<p>and emergency contacts if you are in a severe car crash.</p>
<p>If you have both Apple Watch and iPhone,</p>
<p>they seamlessly work together to get you help efficiently.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s Ashley to tell you about another new safety service</p>
<p>coming to iPhone.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Ashley Williams: Emergencies don&rsquo;t always happen when it&rsquo;s convenient.</p>
<p>When you need help, you need it wherever you are,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have Wi-Fi or cell service.</p>
<p>Now, your iPhone can connect you with the help you need</p>

<p>Today, we are announcing a groundbreaking new service for iPhone:</p>
<p>Emergency SOS via satellite.</p>
<p>While iPhone is designed for a best-in-class cellular experience,</p>
<p>connecting to a satellite presents an entirely new set of challenges.</p>
<p>Smartphones connect to cell towers that are a few miles away.</p>
<p>Over the last several decades,</p>
<p>carriers have built more and more cell towers</p>
<p>to improve the strength and speed of their network service.</p>
<p>However, there are some places– like winding back roads</p>
<p>and mountain ridges– that cell towers don&rsquo;t reach.</p>
<p>Connectivity in these areas can be provided by communication satellites.</p>
<p>Unlike stationary cell towers,</p>
<p>communication satellites are hundreds of miles above the Earth,</p>
<p>and flying at over 15,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p>To connect to these satellites, you need to be outside,</p>
<p>with a clear view of the sky.</p>
<p>And the bandwidth is so limited that even sending a text message</p>
<p>is a technical challenge.</p>
<p>Typically, the only way to tap into such a network</p>
<p>is with an expensive device that uses a bulky external antenna.</p>
<p>We knew that approach just wouldn&rsquo;t work for iPhone.</p>
<p>So we invented another way.</p>
<p>We designed and built custom components and specific software</p>
<p>so that iPhone 14 antennas can connect to satellites&rsquo; unique frequencies.</p>
<p>That connection is only possible when the phone is pointing</p>
<p>directly at a satellite.</p>
<p>However, satellites fly too high to be seen by the human eye.</p>
<p>So we created a unique user experience that shows you where to point your phone</p>
<p>to establish a connection, and stay connected as the satellite moves.</p>
<p>This way, no bulky antenna is needed.</p>
<p>Once connected, you need to send and receive</p>
<p>enough information to get emergency help.</p>
<p>Standard messaging protocols are not designed</p>
<p>for a satellite&rsquo;s limited bandwidth.</p>
<p>So we created a custom short text compression algorithm</p>
<p>to reduce the average size of messages by a factor of three.</p>
<p>Thanks to this algorithm, it can take less than 15 seconds</p>
<p>to send a message if you have a clear view of the sky.</p>
<p>In other conditions, such as light foliage,</p>
<p>it may take a few minutes.</p>
<p>And since each message can take some time,</p>
<p>we knew a standard back-and-forth conversation</p>
<p>would take far too long for an emergency situation.</p>
<p>We worked with emergency experts to surface the questions</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re most likely to ask,</p>
<p>and we provided the most common responses</p>
<p>for you to choose from with just a few taps.</p>
<p>With fewer messages to write and send,</p>
<p>you can get help quicker.</p>
<p>After your message is relayed to a ground station,</p>
<p>it needs to reach the right emergency service provider.</p>
<p>If that emergency service provider accepts text messages,</p>
<p>we will connect you to them directly.</p>
<p>If they only accept voice calls, we have set up Relay Centers,</p>
<p>staffed with highly-trained emergency specialists</p>
<p>ready to get your text and call an emergency service provider on your behalf.</p>
<p>It took years to make this vision a reality</p>
<p>through game-changing hardware, software, and infrastructure innovation.</p>
<p>This breakthrough service can also be used</p>
<p>in more casual, less dire circumstances.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re out on a long hike, you can use the Find My app</p>
<p>to share your location manually via satellite.</p>
<p>This lets your loved ones know where you are,</p>
<p>without you even sending a message.</p>
<p>Now, back to Kaiann.</p>
<p>Kaiann: We believe that this service</p>
<p>is such an essential part of the iPhone experience</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll include it free for two years with iPhone 14.</p>
<p>It launches in November, and we&rsquo;re starting with the US and Canada.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the environment.</p>
<p>Since 2020, Apple&rsquo;s corporate operations have been carbon neutral.</p>
<p>To reach our goal of carbon neutral products by 2030,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at our environmental impact across our supply chain</p>
<p>and the entire product lifecycle.</p>
<p>Over 200 of our suppliers have committed</p>
<p>to 100% renewable energy for Apple production.</p>
<p>Our suppliers work to create less waste and then reuse, recycle, or compost.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2021 alone,</p>
<p>iPhone suppliers kept over 250,000 metric tons of waste</p>
<p>from ending up in a landfill–</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about one year&rsquo;s worth of waste</p>
<p>from 730,000 households.</p>
<p>We build our products to last.</p>
<p>This durability enabled millions of trade-ins to find new owners in 2021.</p>
<p>And when it is time to recycle an iPhone,</p>
<p>that has environmental benefits too.</p>
<p>In fact, one metric ton of recovered main logic boards and cameras</p>
<p>has the same amount of gold and copper as over 2,000 metric tons of mined rock.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t throw away your old iPhone or leave it sitting in a drawer–</p>
<p>bring it to your nearest store or mail it in.</p>
<p>Together, we can reduce our impact on the planet one step at a time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s iPhone 14,</p>
<p>with powerful new cameras, Photonic Engine,</p>
<p>Action mode, A15 Bionic with a 5-core GPU,</p>
<p>Emergency SOS via satellite, Crash Detection,</p>
<p>and the larger 6.7&quot; display size with the best battery life in an iPhone,</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>And later this fall, Apple Fitness+ will be available to all iPhone users,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t yet have an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 will start at just $799.</p>
<p>This is the same starting price as last year&rsquo;s iPhone 13,</p>
<p>but with so much more capability that sets a new standard for iPhone.</p>
<p>And iPhone 14 Plus starts at just $899,</p>
<p>bringing the larger 6.7&quot; display</p>
<p>and the best battery life to more people than ever.</p>
<p>We also have incredible offers from Apple and our partners,</p>
<p>including up to $800 off in the US</p>
<p>when you trade in a qualifying iPhone.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available for pre-order</p>
<p>starting on September 9th.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 will be available on September 16th,</p>

<p>To tell you more about the new iPhone 14 Pro, here&rsquo;s Joz.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Greg &ldquo;Joz&rdquo; Joswiak: Our Pro models feature beautiful</p>
<p>and strong surgical-grade stainless steel,</p>
<p>together with our industry-leading durability features,</p>
<p>including Ceramic Shield and water resistance.</p>
<p>They come in four gorgeous colors:</p>
<p>a new Space Black, Silver,</p>
<p>Gold, and this all new Deep Purple.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 Pro introduces a new front design</p>
<p>that is sure to become iconic.</p>
<p>It starts with the new TrueDepth camera.</p>
<p>We redesigned all components to fit into a smaller size,</p>
<p>using 30% less area.</p>
<p>We put the proximity sensor behind the display for the first time.</p>
<p>With this change, we reconsidered how you interact with your iPhone.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, you experience different types</p>
<p>of alerts and notifications,</p>
<p>and these are often happening while you&rsquo;re doing other things</p>
<p>on your iPhone.</p>
<p>So we developed a new experience that&rsquo;s even better.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Alan to tell you more.</p>
<p>Alan Dye: Our goal was to design a space</p>
<p>that clearly and consistently surfaces alerts and background activity</p>
<p>in a rich and delightful way,</p>
<p>the result being an entirely new and intuitive way to interact with iPhone,</p>
<p>one that truly blurs the line between hardware and software.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re calling it the Dynamic Island.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed this new space to be highly adaptive</p>
<p>so it can fluidly expand into different shapes</p>
<p>using uniquely crafted animations and transitions.</p>
<p>So now, when you receive an alert,</p>
<p>the Dynamic Island expands to notify you.</p>
<p>Our ambition is to clearly convey the information</p>
<p>and present content and controls</p>
<p>without distracting from the app you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>This works across the entire system</p>
<p>for things like confirming your AirPods are connected,</p>
<p>muting, or starting a charge.</p>
<p>Each alert has its own personality,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been designed with its own unique character,</p>
<p>making it easy to identify at a glance,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re using FaceID,</p>
<p>or tapping your iPhone in transit locations.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Island also displays ongoing background activity,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re playing music.</p>
<p>When you swipe to go home,</p>
<p>the Music app gracefully morphs into the Dynamic Island,</p>
<p>always staying active and visible.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve even designed it to show the current album art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also completely interactive.</p>
<p>You can tap and hold to expose more options,</p>
<p>or tap to go back to the app.</p>
<p>So now, when you&rsquo;re on a call,</p>
<p>you have easy access to controls without leaving the app you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed all these animations to feel fluid, lively,</p>
<p>and highly responsive.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Island is always live and active,</p>
<p>heightening the sense of vitality</p>
<p>by adapting in real time to show you important information,</p>
<p>like your next direction from Maps.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always visible for ongoing activities,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re using the timer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed Live Activities– a new feature on the iOS 16 Lock Screen–</p>
<p>to work seamlessly with the Dynamic Island,</p>
<p>including support for third-party apps,</p>
<p>so you can keep track of what&rsquo;s happening from anywhere on iPhone,</p>
<p>like following a baseball game without needing to leave the app you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>or not missing the Lyft ride while texting friends.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also created a robust design system for developers,</p>
<p>so every alert looks and feels consistent, no matter which app it comes from.</p>
<p>And when you have more than one background activity,</p>
<p>the Dynamic Island playfully adapts,</p>
<p>bubbling out into two elements.</p>
<p>At Apple, we&rsquo;re focused on creating extraordinary products,</p>
<p>products born from designing hardware and software together,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t know where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Island does this in a truly magical way</p>
<p>and enables an entirely new iPhone experience.</p>
<p>Back to Joz.</p>
<p>Joz: iPhone 14 Pro has a stunning new display with Pro features.</p>
<p>This is the most advanced display we have ever shipped.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max come in two great sizes,</p>
<p>now with even thinner borders, more active area,</p>
<p>and the Dynamic Island.</p>
<p>It is also brighter.</p>
<p>The new display provides peak HDR brightness of 1600 nits,</p>
<p>bringing iPhone to the same level as the Pro Display XDR.</p>
<p>So photos and HDR movies are gonna look amazing–</p>
<p>including those you shoot on your iPhone.</p>
<p>And for those bright, sunny days, iPhone can now push brightness even higher</p>
<p>for a peak of 2000 nits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s twice as bright as before,</p>
<p>and the highest peak brightness of any smartphone.</p>
<p>The new Lock Screen in iOS 16 introduces more personalization</p>
<p>with widgets and Live Activities,</p>
<p>so this is the perfect time to introduce</p>
<p>Always-On display.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see the time and other important information</p>
<p>without raising your iPhone or tapping the display.</p>
<p>This keeps essential information available for the moments</p>
<p>where all you need is just a glance.</p>
<p>This is made possible by a number of new technologies</p>
<p>that make the display incredibly power efficient.</p>
<p>This display can operate at a refresh rate as low as 1Hz</p>
<p>with a new low power mode,</p>
<p>and we further improved our LTPO technology,</p>
<p>allowing the display to intelligently dim the entire Lock Screen.</p>
<p>We also take advantage of multiple coprocessors in our chip</p>
<p>to refresh the display using minimal power,</p>
<p>so the time, widgets, and Live Activities are always available.</p>
<p>And we use our photographic expertise and powerful image segmentation</p>
<p>to dim wallpaper photos while preserving skin tones,</p>
<p>so they continue to look great.</p>
<p>And you can keep an eye on your Live Activities</p>
<p>without even touching your iPhone.</p>
<p>With all these incredible features,</p>
<p>the new Super Retina XDR is the most advanced display</p>
<p>ever in a smartphone.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 Pro is powered by our new A16 Bionic chip.</p>
<p>Our newest generation of Apple Silicon powers every experience on iPhone.</p>
<p>With A16, we focused on three important areas:</p>
<p>power efficiency, display, and camera.</p>
<p>Delivering incredible performance with leading power efficiency</p>
<p>is a hallmark of Apple silicon.</p>
<p>A16 has nearly 16 billion transistors,</p>
<p>the most ever in an iPhone.</p>
<p>This is our first chip built on a state-of-the-art 4-nanometer process,</p>
<p>enabling greater efficiency while delivering even more performance.</p>
<p>In fact, A16 Bionic is the fastest chip ever in a smartphone.</p>
<p>The competition is still working to catch up with the performance of A13</p>
<p>which we first introduced with iPhone 11 three years ago.</p>
<p>The new 6-core CPU of A16 is generations ahead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to a whopping 40% faster than the competition.</p>
<p>The CPU uses our best-in-class fusion architecture</p>
<p>which delivers both leading performance and leading efficiency.</p>
<p>Our two high-performance cores are faster and use 20% lower power</p>
<p>compared to A15 Bionic.</p>
<p>And most daily tasks can be handled by our high-efficiency cores.</p>
<p>At the same performance level, these new efficiency cores</p>
<p>use one-third the power of even the best of the efficiency cores</p>
<p>from the competition.</p>
<p>This allows iPhone to deliver amazing battery life</p>
<p>while still being extremely responsive.</p>
<p>The new 16-core Neural Engine</p>
<p>is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second,</p>
<p>which helps power iPhone&rsquo;s advanced computational photography.</p>
<p>And the 5-core GPU has 50% more memory bandwidth–</p>
<p>great for graphic-intensive games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an entirely new display engine in A16.</p>
<p>This engine enables the 1Hz refresh rate, Always-On capability,</p>
<p>higher peak brightness, and the advanced anti-aliasing</p>
<p>that makes Dynamic Island animations so incredibly smooth.</p>
<p>A16 also flexes every muscle for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system.</p>
<p>It uses the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and ISP</p>
<p>to perform up to 4 trillion operations per photo.</p>
<p>And the image signal processor was designed to support a new generation</p>
<p>of technology that provides our most powerful Pro camera system ever.</p>
<p>This empowers every user to take their best photos and videos–</p>
<p>from the casual user to the professional.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited for iPhone 14 Pro to push the boundaries for what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and usher in a new era for iPhone photography.</p>

<p>So the new sensor groups every four pixels into one large quad-pixel,</p>
<p>with four times more light.</p>
<p>This further improves light capture</p>
<p>while maintaining the practical 12MP photo size.</p>
<p>Combined with the new Photonic Engine,</p>
<p>the new Main camera has up to</p>
<p>two times low-light improvement for photos</p>
<p>compared to iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the Main camera can do.</p>
<p>You can capture stunning photos across all lighting conditions.</p>
<p>In this brighter shot, the Main camera captured</p>
<p>the beautiful, rich color of her skin,</p>
<p>the detail of the fiber in the blanket,</p>
<p>and even a little of her joy.</p>
<p>For this photo, we locked exposure on the woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>As the vibrant feathers fell, iPhone kept her in sharp focus</p>
<p>while creating a colorful texture around her.</p>
<p>In this low-light example, the Photonic Engine captures</p>
<p>incredible dynamic range,</p>
<p>from the warm glow of her skin,</p>
<p>the color of her eyes,</p>
<p>to every little crease, fold, and texture in the garment.</p>
<p>The new sensor can optimize for detail using each pixel individually,</p>
<p>providing more creative options for shooting and editing in pro workflows.</p>
<p>With this approach we can go beyond the three fixed lenses</p>
<p>of the Pro camera system,</p>
<p>adding a new 2x Telephoto option for our users.</p>
<p>We use the middle 12 megapixels of the new sensor</p>
<p>to deliver a full-resolution photo</p>
<p>and 4K video with optical quality.</p>
<p>This Telephoto has larger pixels and a faster aperture</p>
<p>than any previous 2x Telephoto camera on iPhone,</p>
<p>delivering incredible photos and videos.</p>
<p>And it has a familiar focal length that is great for Portrait mode,</p>
<p>capturing stunning detail with beautiful bokeh.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also using the new sensor to optimize for detail in ProRAW.</p>
<p>ProRAW merges the best of our intelligent computational photography</p>
<p>with the benefits of the RAW format,</p>
<p>giving Pro photographers full creative control</p>
<p>over things like sharpening, white balance,</p>
<p>and our advanced tone mapping with more bit depth and dynamic range.</p>
<p>You can now shoot ProRAW at 48MP resolution,</p>
<p>taking advantage of every pixel in the Main camera</p>
<p>and unlocking incredible editing flexibility.</p>
<p>The new sensor has a different pixel pattern,</p>
<p>so we designed a new machine learning model</p>
<p>that further enhances detail and reduces noise.</p>
<p>This leverages the full power of A16 Bionic</p>
<p>and results in an unprecedented level of detail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable how much we can zoom in,</p>
<p>like in this ethereal photo in Hawaii,</p>
<p>revealing each individual rock on the beach,</p>
<p>and even dry branches from the trees.</p>
<p>With more pixels, Pro photographers can reframe their photos</p>
<p>while still retaining great resolution.</p>
<p>We are able to keep the sharpness and warmth of her eyes</p>
<p>as the focal point of this high-resolution image.</p>
<p>This makes the 48MP Main camera even more versatile,</p>
<p>further empowering the creativity of the most Pro users.</p>
<p>iPhone 14 Pro also has a new Ultra Wide camera,</p>
<p>with a larger sensor, more focus pixels</p>
<p>and–together with the Photonic Engine–</p>
<p>delivers a massive, up to three times, improvement</p>
<p>in light capture for photos.</p>
<p>The new lens is sharper, with more detail,</p>
<p>so macro gets even better,</p>
<p>like this katydid bug</p>
<p>captured in a split second</p>
<p>to reveal more than was visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The flash was completely redesigned for a new adaptive behavior</p>
<p>based on the focal length of the photo.</p>
<p>With a new array of nine LEDs, we control the pattern and intensity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s up to twice as bright,</p>
<p>with up to three times better uniformity</p>
<p>compared to our previous generation.</p>
<p>And with the new Photonic Engine, all cameras of iPhone 14 Pro</p>
<p>get a dramatic improvement in low-light performance,</p>
<p>including up to two times better for the Telephoto camera.</p>
<p>Together with higher-resolution photos and more creative options,</p>
<p>this is our most powerful Pro camera system ever.</p>
<p>Now, back to Joz.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>iPhone is already the choice for filmmakers</p>
