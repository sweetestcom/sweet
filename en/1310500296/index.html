    <p>we can actually figure out where are the aliens out there in space time by being clever about the</p>
<p>few things we can see, one of which is our current date. And so now that you have this living</p>
<p>cosmology, we can tell the story that the universe starts out empty. And then at some point, things</p>
<p>like us appear very primitive, and then some of those stop being quiet and expand. And then for</p>
<p>a few billion years, they expand, and then they meet each other. And then for the next hundred</p>
<p>billion years, they commune with each other. That is, the usual models of cosmology say that in</p>
<p>roughly 150 billion years, the expansion of the universe will happen so much that all you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>left is some galaxy clusters that are sort of disconnected from each other. But before then,</p>
<p>they will interact. There will be this community of all the grabby alien civilizations, and each</p>
<p>one of them will hear about and even meet thousands of others. And we might hope to join</p>
<p>them someday and become part of that community. The following is a conversation with Robin Hansen,</p>
<p>an economist at George Mason University, and one of the most fascinating, wild, fearless,</p>
<p>and fun minds I&rsquo;ve ever gotten the chance to accompany for a time in exploring questions</p>
<p>of human nature, human civilization, and alien life out there in our impossibly big universe.</p>
<p>He is the coauthor of a book titled The Elephant in the Brain, Hidden Motives in Everyday Life,</p>
<p>The Age of M, Work, Love, and Life When Robots Rule the Earth, and a fascinating recent paper</p>
<p>I recommend on quote, Grabby Aliens, titled If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness,</p>
<p>Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check</p>
<p>out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Robin Hansen.</p>
<p>You are working on a book about quote, grabby aliens. This is a technical term, like the Big</p>
<p>Bang. So what are grabby aliens? Grabby aliens expand fast into the universe and they change</p>
<p>stuff. That&rsquo;s the key concept. So if they were out there, we would notice. That&rsquo;s the key idea. So</p>
<p>the question is, where are the grabby aliens? So Fermi&rsquo;s question is, where are the aliens? And we</p>
<p>could vary that in two terms, right? Where are the quiet, hard to see aliens? And where are the</p>
<p>big, loud, grabby aliens? So it&rsquo;s actually hard to say where all the quiet ones are, right?</p>
<p>There could be a lot of them out there because they&rsquo;re not doing much. They&rsquo;re not making a big</p>
<p>difference in the world. But the grabby aliens, by definition, are the ones you would see.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly what they do with where they went, but the idea is they&rsquo;re in some sort</p>
<p>of competitive world where each part of them is trying to grab more stuff and do something with</p>
<p>it. And almost surely, whatever is the most competitive thing to do with all the stuff they</p>
<p>grab isn&rsquo;t to leave it alone the way it started, right? So we humans, when we go around the Earth</p>
<p>and use stuff, we change it. We would turn a forest into a farmland, turn a harbor into a city.</p>
<p>So the idea is aliens would do something with it. And so we&rsquo;re not exactly sure what it would look</p>
<p>like, but it would look different. So somewhere in the sky, we would see big spheres of different</p>
<p>activity where things had been changed because they had been there. Expanding spheres. Right.</p>
<p>So as you expand, you aggressively interact and change the environment.</p>
<p>So the word grabby versus loud, you&rsquo;re using them sometimes synonymously, sometimes not.</p>
<p>Grabby to me is a little bit more aggressive. What does it mean to be loud? What does it mean</p>
<p>to be grabby? What&rsquo;s the difference? And loud in what way? Is it visual? Is it sound? Is it some</p>
<p>other physical phenomena like gravitational waves? Are you using this kind of in a broad</p>
<p>philosophical sense or there&rsquo;s a specific thing that it means to be loud in this universe of ours?</p>
<p>My coauthors and I put together a paper with a particular mathematical model. And so we use the</p>
<p>term grabby aliens to describe that more particular model. And the idea is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>more particular model of the general concept of loud. So loud would just be the general idea that</p>
<p>they would be really obvious. So grabby is the technical term,</p>
<p>is it in the title of the paper? It&rsquo;s in the body. The title is actually about loud and quiet.</p>
<p>Right. So the idea is you want to distinguish your particular model of things from the general</p>
<p>category of things everybody else might talk about. So that&rsquo;s how we distinguish.</p>
<p>The paper title is If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness, Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare.</p>
<p>If life on earth, God, this is such a good abstract. If life on earth had to achieve</p>
<p>N hard steps to reach humanity&rsquo;s level, then the chance of this event rose as time to the nth</p>
<p>power. So we&rsquo;ll talk about power, we&rsquo;ll talk about linear increase. So what is the technical definition</p>
<p>of grabby? How do you envision grabbiness? And why are in contrast with humans, why aren&rsquo;t humans</p>
<p>grabby? So like, where&rsquo;s that line? Is it well definable? What is grabbing what is not grabby?</p>
<p>We have a mathematical model of the distribution of advanced civilizations, i.e. aliens in space</p>
<p>and time. That model has three parameters. And we can set each one of those parameters from data.</p>
<p>And therefore, we claim this is actually what we know about where they are in space time.</p>
<p>So the key idea is they appear at some point in space time. And then after some short delay,</p>
<p>they start expanding. And they expand at some speed. And the speed is one of those parameters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the three. And the other two parameters are about how they appear in time.</p>
<p>That is they appear at random places. And they appear in time according to a power law.</p>
<p>And that power law has two parameters. And we can fit each of those parameters to data. And so then</p>
<p>we can say, now we know, we know the distribution of advanced civilizations in space and time. So</p>
<p>we are right now a new civilization, and we have not yet started to expand. But plausibly,</p>
<p>we would start to do that within say, 10 million years of the current moment. That&rsquo;s plenty of time.</p>
<p>And 10 million years is a really short duration in the history of the universe. So we are at the</p>
<p>moment, a sort of random sample of the kind of times at which an advanced civilization might</p>
<p>appear. Because we may or may not become grabby. But if we do, we&rsquo;ll do it soon. And so our current</p>
<p>date is a sample. And that gives us one of the other parameters. The second parameter is the</p>
<p>constant in front of the power law. And that&rsquo;s arrived from our current date.</p>
<p>So power law, what is the N in the power law?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the more complicated thing to explain.</p>
<p>Right. Advanced life appeared by going through a sequence of hard steps. So starting with very</p>
<p>simple life, and here we are at the end of this process at pretty advanced life. And so we had</p>
<p>to go through some intermediate steps such as sexual selection, photosynthesis, multicellular</p>
<p>animals. And the idea is that each of those steps was hard. Evolution just took a long time searching</p>
<p>in a big space of possibilities to find each of those steps. And the challenge was to achieve</p>
<p>all of those steps by a deadline of when the planets would no longer host simple life. And so</p>
<p>Earth has been really lucky compared to all the other billions of planets out there,</p>
<p>and that we managed to achieve all these steps in the short time of the five billion years that</p>
<p>Earth can support simple life. So not all steps, but a lot of them, because we don&rsquo;t know how many</p>
<p>steps there are before you start the expansion. So these are all the steps from the birth of life</p>
<p>to the initiation of major expansion. Right. So we&rsquo;re pretty sure that it would happen really</p>
<p>soon so that it couldn&rsquo;t be the same sort of a hard step as the last one. So in terms of taking</p>
<p>a long time. So when we look at the history of Earth, we look at the durations of the major</p>
<p>things that have happened. That suggests that there&rsquo;s roughly say six hard steps that happened,</p>
<p>say between three and 12, and that we have just achieved the last one that would take a long time.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know. But whatever it is, we&rsquo;ve just achieved the last one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about humans or aliens here. So let&rsquo;s talk about some of these steps. So</p>
<p>Earth is really special in some way. We don&rsquo;t exactly know the level of specialness. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know which steps were the hardest or not because we just have a sample of one. But you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying that there&rsquo;s three to 12 steps that we have to go through to get to where we are that are hard</p>
<p>steps, hard to find by something that took a long time and is unlikely. There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to fail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more ways to fail than to succeed. The first step would be sort of the very simplest</p>
<p>form of life of any sort. And then we don&rsquo;t know whether that first sort is the first sort that we</p>
<p>see in the historical record or not. But then some other steps are, say, the development of</p>
<p>photosynthesis, the development of sexual reproduction. There&rsquo;s the development of</p>
<p>eukaryote cells, which are certain kind of complicated cells that seems to have only</p>
<p>appeared once. And then there&rsquo;s multicellularity, that is multiple cells coming together to large</p>
<p>organisms like us. And in this statistical model of trying to fit all these steps into a finite</p>
<p>window, the model actually predicts that these steps could be of varying difficulties. That is,</p>
<p>they could each take different amounts of time on average. But if you&rsquo;re lucky enough that they all</p>
<p>appear in a very short time, then the durations between them will be roughly equal. And the time</p>
<p>remaining leftover in the rest of the window will also be the same length. So we at the moment have</p>
<p>roughly a billion years left on Earth until simple life like us would no longer be possible.</p>
<p>Life appeared roughly 400 million years after the very first time when life was possible at the very</p>
<p>beginning. So those two numbers right there give you the rough estimate of six hard steps.</p>
<p>Just to build up an intuition here. So we&rsquo;re trying to create a simple mathematical model</p>
<p>of how life emerges and expands in the universe. And there&rsquo;s a section in this paper, how many</p>
<p>hard steps? Question mark. Right. The two most plausibly diagnostic Earth durations seem to be</p>
<p>the one remaining after now before Earth becomes uninhabitable for complex life. So you estimate</p>
<p>how long Earth lasts, how many hard steps. There&rsquo;s windows for doing different hard steps,</p>
<p>and you can sort of like cueing theory, mathematically estimate of like the solution</p>
<p>or the passing of the hard steps or the taking of the hard steps. Sort of like coldly mathematical</p>
<p>look. If life, pre expansionary life, requires n number of steps, what is the probability of taking</p>
<p>those steps on an Earth that lasts a billion years or two billion years or five billion years</p>
<p>or 10 billion years? And you say solving for E using the observed durations of 1.1 and 0.4</p>
<p>then gives E values of 3.9 and 12.5 range 5.7 to 26 suggesting a middle estimate of at least six.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you said six hard steps. Right. Just to get to where we are. Right. We started at the</p>
<p>bottom. Now we&rsquo;re here. That took six steps on average. The key point is on average, these things</p>
<p>on any one random planet would take trillions or trillions of years, just a really long time.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re really lucky that they all happened really fast in a short time before our window</p>
<p>closed. And the chance of that happening in that short window goes as that time period to the power</p>
<p>of the number of steps. And so that was where the power we talked about before came from. And so</p>
<p>that means in the history of the universe, we should overall roughly expect advanced life to</p>
<p>appear as a power law in time. So that very early on, there was very little chance of anything</p>
<p>appearing. And then later on as things appear, other things are appearing somewhat closer to</p>
<p>them in time because they&rsquo;re all going as this power law. What is the power law? Can we, for</p>
<p>people who are not math inclined, can you describe what a power law is? So say the function X is</p>
<p>linear and X squared is quadratic. So it&rsquo;s the power of two. If we make X to the three, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cubic or the power of three. And so X to the sixth is the power of six. And so we&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>life appears in the universe on a planet like Earth in that proportion to the time that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been ready for life to appear. And that over the universe in general, it&rsquo;ll appear at roughly a</p>
<p>power law like that. What is the X, what is N? Is it the number of hard steps?</p>
<p>Yes, the number of hard steps. So that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re gambling and you&rsquo;re doubling up every time, this is the probability you just</p>
<p>keep winning. So it gets very unlikely very quickly. And so we&rsquo;re the result of this unlikely</p>
<p>chain of successes. It&rsquo;s actually a lot like cancer. So the dominant model of cancer in an</p>
<p>organism like each of us is that we have all these cells and in order to become cancerous,</p>
<p>a single cell has to go through a number of mutations and these very unlikely mutations.</p>
<p>And so any one cell is very unlikely to have any, have all these mutations happen by the time</p>
<p>your lifespan&rsquo;s over. But we have enough cells in our body that the chance of any one cell</p>
<p>producing cancer by the end of your life is actually pretty high, more like 40%.</p>
<p>And so the chance of cancer appearing in your lifetime also goes as a power law,</p>
<p>this power of the number of mutations that&rsquo;s required for any one cell in your body to become</p>
<p>cancerous.</p>
<p>The longer you live, the likely you are to have cancer cells.</p>
<p>And the power is also roughly six. That is the chance of you getting cancer is</p>
<p>roughly the power of six of the time you&rsquo;ve been since you were born.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not lost on people that you&rsquo;re comparing power laws of the survival or the</p>
<p>arrival of the human species to cancerous cells.</p>
<p>The same mathematical model, but of course, we might have a different value assumption</p>
<p>about the two outcomes. But of course, from the point of view of cancer, it&rsquo;s more similar.</p>
<p>For the point of view of cancer, it&rsquo;s a win win. We both get to thrive, I suppose.</p>
<p>It is interesting to take the point of view of all kinds of life forms on earth,</p>
<p>of viruses, of bacteria. They have a very different view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Instagram channel, Nature is Metal.</p>
<p>The ethic under which nature operates doesn&rsquo;t often coincide, correlate with human</p>
<p>morals. It seems cold and machine like in the selection process that it performs.</p>
<p>I am an analyst, I&rsquo;m a scholar, an intellectual, and I feel I should carefully distinguish</p>
<p>predicting what&rsquo;s likely to happen and then evaluating or judging what I think would be</p>
<p>better to happen. And it&rsquo;s a little dangerous to mix those up too closely because then we can</p>
<p>then we can have wishful thinking. And so I try typically to just analyze what seems likely to</p>
<p>happen regardless of whether I like it or that we do anything about it. And then once you see</p>
<p>a rough picture of what&rsquo;s likely to happen if we do nothing, then we can ask, well, what might we</p>
<p>prefer? And ask, where could the levers be to move it at least a little toward what we might prefer?</p>
<p>But often doing that just analysis of what&rsquo;s likely to happen if we do nothing offends many</p>
<p>people. They find that dehumanizing or cold or metal, as you say, to just say, well, this is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s likely to happen and it&rsquo;s not your favorite, sorry, but maybe we can do something, but maybe</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do that much. This is very interesting that the cold analysis, whether it&rsquo;s geopolitics,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s medicine, whether it&rsquo;s economics, sometimes misses some very specific aspect of</p>
<p>human condition. Like for example, when you look at a doctor and the act of a doctor helping a</p>
<p>single patient, if you do the analysis of that doctor&rsquo;s time and cost of the medicine or the</p>
<p>surgery or the transportation of the patient, this is the Paul Farmer question, you know, is it worth</p>
<p>spending ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars on this one patient? When you look at all the people</p>
<p>that are suffering in the world, that money could be spent so much better. And yet there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about human nature that wants to help the person in front of you, and that is actually the right</p>
<p>thing to do, despite the analysis. And sometimes when you do the analysis, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about the human mind that allows you to not take that leap, that irrational leap to act in this way,</p>
<p>that the analysis explains it away. Well it&rsquo;s like, for example, the U.S. government, you know, the</p>
<p>DOT, Department of Transportation, puts a value of I think like nine million dollars on a human life.</p>
<p>And the moment you put that number on a human life, you can start thinking, well okay, I can start</p>
<p>making decisions about this or that, and with a sort of cold economic perspective, and then you</p>
<p>might lose, you might deviate from a deeper truth of what it means to be human somehow. You have to</p>
<p>dance, because then if you put too much weight on the anecdotal evidence on these kinds of human</p>
<p>emotions, then you&rsquo;re going to lose, you could also probably more likely deviate from truth.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about that cold analysis. Like I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of people</p>
<p>coldly analyze wars. War in Yemen, war in Syria, Israel, Palestine, war in Ukraine, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something lost when you do a cold analysis of why something happened. When you talk about energy,</p>
<p>talking about sort of conflict, competition over resources, when you talk about geopolitics,</p>
<p>sort of models of geopolitics, and why a certain war happened, you lose something about the suffering</p>
<p>that happens. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s an interesting thing, because you&rsquo;re both, you&rsquo;re exceptionally good</p>
<p>at models in all domains, literally, but also there&rsquo;s a humanity to you. So it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>dance. I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on that dance. Sure. It&rsquo;s definitely true, as you say,</p>
<p>that for many people, if you are accurate in your judgment of, say, for a medical patient,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the chance that this treatment might help? And what&rsquo;s the cost? And compare those</p>
<p>to each other, and you might say, this looks like a lot of cost for a small medical gain.</p>
<p>And at that point, knowing that fact, that might take the air out of your sails. You might</p>
<p>not be willing to do the thing that maybe you feel is right anyway, which is still to pay for it.</p>
<p>And then somebody knowing that might want to keep that news from you and not tell you about</p>
<p>the low chance of success or the high cost in order to save you this</p>
<p>tension, this awkward moment where you might fail to do what they and you think is right.</p>
<p>But I think the higher calling, the higher standard to hold you to, which many people</p>
<p>can be held to, is to say, I will look at things accurately, I will know the truth,</p>
<p>and then I will also do the right thing with it. I will be at peace with my judgment about what</p>
<p>the right thing is in terms of the truth. I don&rsquo;t need to be lied to in order to figure out what the</p>
<p>right thing to do is. And I think if you do think you need to be lied to in order to figure out</p>
<p>what the right thing to do is, you&rsquo;re at a great disadvantage because then people will be lying</p>
<p>to, you will be lying to yourself, and you won&rsquo;t be as effective at achieving whatever good you</p>
<p>were trying to achieve. But getting the data, getting the facts is step one, not the final</p>
<p>step. So I would say having a good model, getting the good data is step one, and it&rsquo;s a burden.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t just use that data to arrive at sort of the easy convenient thing. You have</p>
<p>to really deeply think about what is the right thing. So the dark aspect of data, of models,</p>
<p>is you can use it to excuse away actions that aren&rsquo;t ethical. You can use data to basically</p>
<p>excuse away anything. But not looking at data lets you excuse yourself to pretend and think</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing good when you&rsquo;re not. Exactly. But it is a burden. It doesn&rsquo;t excuse you from</p>
<p>still being human and deeply thinking about what is right. That very kind of gray area,</p>
<p>that very subjective area, that&rsquo;s part of the human condition. But let us return for a time</p>
<p>to aliens. So you started to define sort of the model, the parameters of grabbiness.</p>
<p>As we approach grabbiness. So what happens? So again, there was three parameters. There&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>speed at which they expand, there&rsquo;s the rate at which they appear in time, and that rate has a</p>
<p>constant and a power. So we&rsquo;ve talked about the history of life on Earth suggests that power is</p>
<p>around 6, but maybe 3 to 12. We can say that constant comes from our current date, sort of</p>
<p>sets the overall rate. And the speed, which is the last parameter, comes from the fact that when we</p>
<p>look in the sky, we don&rsquo;t see them. So the model predicts very strongly that if they were expanding</p>
<p>slowly, say 1% of the speed of light, our sky would be full of vast spheres that were full</p>
<p>of activity. That is, at a random time when a civilization is first appearing, if it looks out</p>
<p>into its sky, it would see many other grabby alien civilizations in the sky, and they would be much</p>
<p>bigger than the full moon. There&rsquo;d be huge spheres in the sky, and they would be visibly different.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see them. Can we pause for a second? Okay. There&rsquo;s a bunch of hard steps that Earth had to</p>
<p>pass to arrive at this place we are currently, which we&rsquo;re starting to launch rockets onto space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of starting to expand a bit, very slowly. Okay. But this is like the birth. If you</p>
<p>look at the entirety of the history of Earth, we&rsquo;re now at this precipice of like expansion.</p>
<p>We could, we might not choose to, but if we do, we will do it in the next 10 million years.</p>
<p>10 million. Wow. Time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>10 million is a short time on the cosmological scale. So that is, it might be only a thousand,</p>
<p>but the point is if it&rsquo;s, even if it&rsquo;s up to 10 million, that hardly makes any difference to the</p>
<p>model. So I might as well give you 10 million. This, this makes me feel, I was, I was so stressed</p>
<p>about planning what I&rsquo;m going to do today. And now you got plenty of time, plenty of time.</p>
<p>Uh, just need to be generating some offspring quickly here. Okay. Um, so, and there&rsquo;s this moment</p>
<p>this 10 million, uh, year gap, uh, or window when we start expanding and you&rsquo;re saying, okay,</p>
<p>so this is an interesting moment where there&rsquo;s a bunch of other alien civilizations that might at</p>
<p>some history of the universe arrived at this moment we&rsquo;re here, they passed all the hard steps.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a model for how likely it is that that happens. And then they start expanding</p>
<p>and you think of an expansion is almost like a sphere. Right. That&rsquo;s when you say speed,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the speed of the radius growth. Exactly. Like the surface, how fast the</p>
<p>surface. Okay. And so you&rsquo;re saying that there is some speed for that expansion, average speed,</p>
<p>and then we can play with that parameter. And if that speed is super slow, then maybe that</p>
<p>explains why we haven&rsquo;t seen anything. If it&rsquo;s super fast, the slow would create the puzzle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slow predicts, we would see them, but we don&rsquo;t see them as a way to explain that is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fast. So the idea is if they&rsquo;re moving really fast, then we don&rsquo;t see them until they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>almost here. Okay, this is counterintuitive. All right, hold on a second. So I think this</p>
<p>works best when I say a bunch of dumb things. Okay. And then you elucidate the full complexity</p>
<p>and the beauty of the dumbness. Okay. So there&rsquo;s these spheres out there in the universe that are</p>
<p>made visible because they&rsquo;re sort of using a lot of energy. So they&rsquo;re generating a lot of light</p>
<p>stuff. They&rsquo;re changing things. They&rsquo;re changing things. And change would be visible a long way</p>
<p>off. Yes. They would take apart stars, rearrange them, restructure galaxies. They would do all</p>
<p>kinds of big, huge stuff. Okay. If they&rsquo;re expanding slowly, we would see a lot of them</p>
<p>because the universe is old, is old enough to where we would see them. That is we&rsquo;re assuming</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just typical, you know, maybe at the 50th percentile of them. So like half of them have</p>
<p>appeared so far. The other half will still appear later. And the math of our best estimate is that</p>
<p>they appear roughly once per million galaxies. And we would meet them in roughly a billion years</p>
<p>if we expanded out to meet them. So we&rsquo;re looking at a grabby aliens model</p>
<p>3D sim. That&rsquo;s the actual name of the video. By the time we get to 13.8 billion years, the fun</p>
<p>begins. Okay. So this is, we&rsquo;re watching a three dimensional sphere rotating. I presume that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>universe. And then grabby aliens are expanding and filling that universe with all kinds of fun.</p>
<p>Pretty soon it&rsquo;s all full. It&rsquo;s full. So that&rsquo;s how the grabby aliens come in contact. First of all,</p>
<p>with other aliens and then with us humans. The following is a simulation of the grabby aliens</p>
<p>model of alien civilizations. Civilizations are born that expand outwards at constant speed.</p>
<p>A spherical region of space is shown. By the time we get to 13.8 billion years,</p>
<p>this sphere will be about 3000 times as wide as the distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda.</p>
<p>Okay. This is fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>Okay. It&rsquo;s huge. All right. So why don&rsquo;t we see, we&rsquo;re one little tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny dot in</p>
<p>that giant, giant sphere. Why don&rsquo;t we see any of the grabby aliens?</p>
<p>It depends on how fast they expand. So you could see that if they expanded at the speed of light,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t see them until they were here. So like out there, if somebody is destroying the</p>
<p>universe with a vacuum decay, there&rsquo;s this, there&rsquo;s this doomsday scenario where somebody</p>
<p>somewhere could change the vacuum of the universe and that would expand at the speed of light and</p>
<p>basically destroy everything it hit. But you&rsquo;d never see that until I got here because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>expanding at the speed of light. If you&rsquo;re expanding really slow, then you see it from</p>
<p>a long way off. So the fact we don&rsquo;t see anything in the sky tells us they&rsquo;re expanding fast,</p>
<p>say over a third the speed of light. And that&rsquo;s really, really fast. But that&rsquo;s what you have to</p>
<p>believe if we look out and you don&rsquo;t see anything. Now you might say, well, how, maybe I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to believe this whole model. Why should I believe this whole model at all? And our best</p>
<p>evidence why you should believe this model is our early date. We are right now almost 14 billion</p>
<p>years into the universe on a planet around a star that&rsquo;s roughly 5 billion years old.</p>
<p>But the average star out there will last roughly 5 trillion years. That is a thousand times longer.</p>
<p>And remember that power law, it says that the chance of advanced life appearing on a planet</p>
<p>goes as the power of sixth of the time. So if a planet lasts a thousand times longer,</p>
<p>then the chance of it appearing on that planet, if everything would stay empty at least, is a</p>
<p>thousand to the sixth power or 10 to the 18. So enormous, overwhelming chance that if the universe</p>
<p>would just stay sit and empty and waiting for advanced life to appear, when it would appear</p>
<p>would be way at the end of all these planet lifetimes. That is the long planets near the end</p>
<p>of the lifetime, trillions of years into the future. So, but we&rsquo;re really early compared to that. And</p>
<p>our explanation is at the moment, as you saw in the video, the universe is filling up in roughly a</p>
<p>billion years, it&rsquo;ll all be full. And at that point, it&rsquo;s too late for advanced life to show up.</p>
<p>So you had to show up now before that deadline. Okay. Can we break that apart a little bit? Okay.</p>
<p>Or linger on some of the things you said. So with the power law, the things we&rsquo;ve done on earth,</p>
<p>the model you have says that it&rsquo;s very unlikely, like we&rsquo;re lucky SOBs. Is that mathematically</p>
<p>correct to say? We&rsquo;re crazy early. That is when early means like in the history of the universe.</p>
<p>In the history. Okay. So given this model, how do we make sense of that? If we&rsquo;re super,</p>
<p>can we just be the lucky ones? Well, 10 to the 18 lucky, you know,</p>
<p>how lucky do you feel? So, you know, that&rsquo;s a pretty lucky, right? 10 to the 18 is a billion,</p>
<p>billion. So then if you were just being honest and humble, that that means, what does that mean?</p>
<p>It means one of the assumptions that calculated this crazy early must be wrong. That&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>means. So the key assumption we suggest is that the universe would stay empty. So most life would</p>
<p>stay empty. So most life would appear like a thousand times longer later than now if everything</p>
<p>would stay empty, waiting for it to appear. So what is not empty?</p>
<p>So the grabby aliens are filling the universe right now. Roughly at the moment, they filled</p>
<p>half of the universe and they&rsquo;ve changed it. And when they fill everything, it&rsquo;s too late for stuff</p>
<p>like us to appear. But wait, hold on a second. Did anyone help us get lucky? If it&rsquo;s so difficult,</p>
<p>what, how do like, so it&rsquo;s like cancer, right? There&rsquo;s all these cells, each of which randomly</p>
<p>does or doesn&rsquo;t get cancer. And eventually some cell gets cancer and you know, we were one of</p>
<p>those, but hold on a second. Okay. But we got it early. We got early compared to the prediction</p>
<p>with an assumption that&rsquo;s wrong. That&rsquo;s so that&rsquo;s how we do a lot of, you know, theoretical</p>
<p>analysis. You have a model that makes a prediction that&rsquo;s wrong. Then that helps you reject that</p>
<p>model. Okay. Let&rsquo;s try to understand exactly where the wrong is. So the assumption is that the</p>
<p>universe is empty, stays empty, stays empty and waits until this advanced life appears in trillions</p>
<p>of years. That is if the universe would just stay empty, if there was just, you know, nobody else</p>
<p>out there, then when you should expect advanced life to appear, if you&rsquo;re the only one in the</p>
<p>universe, when should you expect to appear? You should expect to appear trillions of years in the</p>
<p>future. I see. Right, right. So this is a very sort of nuanced mathematical assumption. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we can intuit it cleanly with words. But if you assume that you&rsquo;re just wait, the universe</p>
<p>stays empty and you&rsquo;re waiting for one life civilization to pop up, then it&rsquo;s gonna, it</p>
<p>should happen very late, much later than now. And if you look at Earth, the way things happen on</p>
<p>Earth, it happened much, much, much, much, much earlier than it was supposed to according to this</p>
<p>model. If you take the initial assumption, therefore you can say, well, the initial assumption of the</p>
<p>universe staying empty is very unlikely. Right. And the other alternative theory is the universe</p>
<p>is filling up and will fill up soon. And so we are typical for the origin data of things that</p>
<p>can appear before the deadline. Before the deadline. Okay, it&rsquo;s filling up. So why don&rsquo;t we see anything</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s filling up? Because they&rsquo;re expanding really fast. Close to the speed of light. Exactly.</p>
<p>So we will only see it when it&rsquo;s here. Almost here. Okay. What are the ways in which we might see</p>
<p>a quickly expanding? This is both exciting and terrifying. It is terrifying. It&rsquo;s like watching</p>
<p>a truck, like driving at you at 100 miles an hour. And so we would see spheres in the sky,</p>
<p>at least one sphere in the sky, growing very rapidly. And like very rapidly, right? Yes,</p>
<p>very rapidly. So we&rsquo;re not, so there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, you know, different def because we were just</p>
<p>talking about 10 million years. This would be, you might see it 10 million years in advance coming.</p>
<p>I mean, you still might have a long warning. Again, the universe is 14 billion years old.</p>
<p>The typical origin times of these things are spread over several billion years. So the chance</p>
<p>of one originating at a, you know, very close to you in time is very low. So they still might take</p>
<p>millions of years from the time you see it, from the time it gets here. You&rsquo;ll have a million years</p>
<p>of your years to be terrified of this mass sphere coming at you. But coming at you very fast. So if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re traveling close to the speed of light, but they&rsquo;re coming from a long way away. So remember,</p>
<p>the rate at which they appear is one per million galaxies, right? So they&rsquo;re roughly a hundred</p>
<p>galaxies away. I see. So the Delta between the speed of light and their actual travel speed is</p>
<p>very important, right? So even if they&rsquo;re going at say half the speed of light, we&rsquo;ll have a long</p>
<p>time then. Yeah. But what if they&rsquo;re traveling exactly at a speed of light? Then we see them,</p>
<p>like then we wouldn&rsquo;t have much warning, but that&rsquo;s less likely. Well, we can&rsquo;t exclude it.</p>
<p>And they could also be somehow traveling faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>But I think we can&rsquo;t exclude because if they could go faster than the speed of light, then</p>
<p>they would just already be everywhere. So in a universe where you can travel faster than the</p>
<p>speed of light, you can go backwards in space time. So any time you appeared anywhere in space</p>
<p>time, you could just fill up everything. Yeah. And so anybody in the future, whoever appeared,</p>
<p>they would have been here by now. Can you exclude the possibility that those kinds of aliens aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>already here? Well, you have, we should have a different discussion of that. Okay. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually lead that. Let&rsquo;s leave that discussion aside just to linger and understand the grabby</p>
<p>alien expansion, which is beautiful and fascinating. Okay. So there&rsquo;s these giant expanding</p>
<p>spheres of alien civilizations. Now, when those spheres collide, mathematically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that we&rsquo;re not the first collision of grabby alien civilizations,</p>
<p>I suppose is one way to say it. So there&rsquo;s like the first time the spheres touch each other,</p>
<p>recognize each other. They meet. They recognize each other first before they meet.</p>
<p>They see each other coming. They see each other coming. And then, so there&rsquo;s a bunch of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a combinatorial thing where they start seeing each other coming. And then there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>third neighbor. It&rsquo;s like, what the hell? And then there&rsquo;s a fourth one. Okay. So what does that,</p>
<p>you think, look like? What lessons from human nature, that&rsquo;s the only data we have,</p>
<p>well, can you draw the story of the history of the universe here is what I would call a living</p>
<p>cosmology. So what I&rsquo;m excited about in part by this model is that it lets us tell a story of</p>
<p>cosmology where there are actors who have agendas. So most ancient peoples, they had cosmologies,</p>
<p>stories they told about where the universe came from and where it&rsquo;s going and what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>out there. And their stories, they like to have agents and actors, gods or something out there</p>
<p>doing things. And lately our favorite cosmology is dead, kind of boring. We&rsquo;re the only activity</p>
<p>we know about or see and everything else just looks dead and empty. But this is now telling us,</p>
<p>no, that&rsquo;s not quite right. At the moment, the universe is filling up and in a few billion years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be all full. And from then on, the history of the universe will be the universe full of aliens.</p>
<p>LW. Yeah. So that&rsquo;s a really good reminder, a really good way to think about cosmology is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>surrounded by a vast darkness and we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in that darkness until the light</p>
<p>from whatever generate lights arrives here. So we kind of, yeah, we look up at the sky,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s stars, oh, they&rsquo;re pretty, but you don&rsquo;t think about the giant expanding spheres of</p>
<p>aliens because you don&rsquo;t see them. But now our date, looking at the clock, if you&rsquo;re clever,</p>
<p>the clock tells you. So I like the analogy with the ancient Greeks. So you might think that an</p>
<p>ancient Greek staring at the universe couldn&rsquo;t possibly tell how far away the sun was or how</p>
<p>far away the moon is or how big the earth is. All you can see is just big things in the sky,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell. But they were clever enough actually to be able to figure out the size of</p>
<p>the earth and the distance to the moon and the sun and the size of the moon and sun. That is,</p>
<p>they could figure those things out actually by being clever enough. And so similarly,</p>
<p>we can actually figure out where are the aliens out there in space time by being clever about the</p>
<p>few things we can see, one of which is our current date. And so now that you have this living</p>
<p>cosmology, we can tell the story that the universe starts out empty and then at some point, things</p>
<p>like us appear very primitive and then some of those stop being quiet and expand. And then for</p>
<p>a few billion years, they expand and then they meet each other. And then for the next hundred</p>
<p>billion years, they commune with each other. That is, the usual models of cosmology say that in</p>
<p>roughly 150 billion years, the expansion of the universe will happen so much that all you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>left is some galaxy clusters that are sort of disconnected from each other. But before then,</p>
<p>for the next hundred billion years, they will interact. There will be this community of all the</p>
<p>grabby alien civilizations and each one of them will hear about and even meet thousands of others.</p>
<p>And we might hope to join them someday and become part of that community. That&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing to aspire to. Yes, interesting is an interesting word. Is the universe of alien</p>
<p>civilizations defined by war as much or more than war defined human history?</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s defined by competition and then the question is how much competition implies war.</p>
<p>So up until recently, competition defined life on Earth. Competition between species and organisms</p>
<p>and among humans, competitions among individuals and communities and that competition often took</p>
<p>the form of war in the last 10,000 years. Many people now are hoping or even expecting to sort</p>
<p>of suppress and end competition in human affairs. They regulate business competition, they prevent</p>
<p>military competition and that&rsquo;s a future I think a lot of people will like to continue and</p>
<p>strengthen. People will like to have something close to world government or world governance or</p>
<p>at least a world community and they will like to suppress war and many forms of business and</p>
<p>personal competition over the coming centuries. And they may like that so much that they prevent</p>
<p>interstellar colonization which would become the end of that era. That is interstellar colonization</p>
<p>would just return severe competition to human or our descendant affairs and many civilizations may</p>
<p>prefer that and ours may prefer that. But if they choose to allow interstellar colonization,</p>
<p>they will have chosen to allow competition to return with great force. That is, there&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>not much of a way to centrally govern a rapidly expanding sphere of civilization. And so I think</p>
<p>one of the most solid things we can predict about Graviolians is they have accepted competition</p>
<p>and they have internal competition and therefore they have the potential for competition when they</p>
<p>meet each other at the borders. But whether that&rsquo;s military competition is more of an open question.</p>
<p>LW. So military meaning physically destructive, right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot to say there. So one idea that you kind of proposed is progress might be maximized</p>
<p>through competition, through some kind of healthy competition, some definition of healthy. So like</p>
<p>constructive not destructive competition. So like we would likely grab the alien civilizations would</p>
<p>be likely defined by competition because they can expand faster because competition allows</p>
<p>innovation and sort of the battle of ideas.</p>
<p>LW. The way I would take the logic is to say competition just happens if you can&rsquo;t coordinate</p>
<p>to stop it and you probably can&rsquo;t coordinate to stop it in an expanding interstellar way.</p>
<p>LW. So competition is a fundamental force in the universe.</p>
<p>LW. It has been so far and it would be within an expanding Graviolian civilization. But we today</p>
<p>have the chance, many people think and hope, of greatly controlling and limiting competition</p>
<p>within our civilization for a while. And that&rsquo;s an interesting choice whether to allow competition</p>
<p>to sort of regain its full force or whether to suppress and manage it.</p>
<p>LW. Well one of the open questions that has been raised in the past less than 100 years</p>
<p>is whether our desire to lessen the destructive nature of competition or the destructive kind</p>
<p>of competition will be outpaced by the destructive power of our weapons. Sort of if nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and weapons of that kind become more destructive than our desire for peace then all it takes is</p>
<p>one asshole at the party to ruin the party.</p>
<p>LW. It takes one asshole to make a delay, but not that much of a delay on the cosmological</p>
<p>scales we&rsquo;re talking about. So even a vast nuclear war, if it happened here right now on Earth,</p>
<p>it would not kill all humans and it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t kill all life.</p>
<p>And so human civilization would return within 100,000 years.</p>
<p>LW. So all the history of atrocities and if you look at the Black Plague,</p>
<p>which is not human caused atrocities or whatever.</p>
<p>LW. There are a lot of military atrocities in history, absolutely.</p>
<p>LW. In the 20th century. Those are, those challenge us to think about human nature,</p>
<p>but the cosmic scale of time and space, they do not stop the human spirit, essentially.</p>
<p>The humanity goes on through all the atrocities, it goes on.</p>
<p>LW. Most likely.</p>
<p>LW. So even a nuclear war isn&rsquo;t enough to destroy us or to stop our potential from expanding,</p>
<p>but we could institute a regime of global governance that limited competition,</p>
<p>including military and business competition of sorts, and that could prevent our expansion.</p>
<p>LW. Of course, to play devil&rsquo;s advocate, global governance is centralized power,</p>
<p>power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. One of the aspects of competition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been very productive is not letting any one person, any one country, any one center of power</p>
<p>become absolutely powerful, because that&rsquo;s another lesson, is it seems to corrupt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about ego in the human mind that seems to be corrupted by power,</p>
<p>so when you say global governance, that terrifies me more than the possibility of war,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>LW. I think people will be less terrified than you are right now,</p>
<p>and let me try to paint the picture from their point of view. This isn&rsquo;t my point of view,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s going to be a widely shared point of view.</p>
<p>LW. Yes. This is two devil&rsquo;s advocates arguing.</p>
<p>LW. Two devils.</p>
<p>LW. Okay. So for the last half century and into the continuing future, we actually have had</p>
<p>a strong elite global community that shares a lot of values and beliefs and has created a lot</p>
<p>of convergence in global policy. So if you look at electromagnetic spectrum or medical experiments</p>
<p>or pandemic policy or nuclear power energy or regulating airplanes or just in a wide range</p>
<p>of area, in fact, the world has very similar regulations and rules everywhere, and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a coincidence because they are part of a world community where people get together at places</p>
<p>like Davos, et cetera, where world elites want to be respected by other world elites, and they</p>
<p>have a convergence of opinion, and that produces something like global governance,</p>
<p>but without a global center. This is what human mobs or communities have done for a long time,</p>
<p>that is, humans can coordinate together on shared behavior without a center by having</p>
<p>gossip and reputation within a community of elites. And that is what we have been doing and</p>
<p>are likely to do a lot more of. So for example, one of the things that&rsquo;s happening, say, with the</p>
<p>war in Ukraine is that this world community of elites has decided that they disapprove of the</p>
<p>Russian invasion and they are coordinating to pull resources together from all around the world in</p>
<p>order to oppose it, and they are proud of that, sharing that opinion in there, and they feel that</p>
<p>they are morally justified in their stance there. And that&rsquo;s the kind of event that actually brings</p>
<p>world elite communities together, where they come together and they push a particular policy and</p>
<p>position that they share and that they achieve successes. And the same sort of passion animates</p>
<p>global elites with respect to, say, global warming or global poverty and other sorts of things. And</p>
<p>they are, in fact, making progress on those sorts of things through shared global community of</p>
<p>elites. And in some sense, they are slowly walking toward global governance, slowly strengthening</p>
<p>various world institutions of governance, but cautiously, carefully watching out for the</p>
<p>possibility of a single power that might corrupt it. I think a lot of people over the coming</p>
<p>centuries will look at that history and like it. It&rsquo;s an interesting thought. And thank you for</p>
<p>playing that devil&rsquo;s advocate there. But I think the elites too easily lose touch of the morals</p>
<p>that the best of human nature and power corrupts. Sure, but their view is the one that determines</p>
<p>what happens. Their view may still end up there, even if you or I might criticize it from that</p>
<p>point of view. So from a perspective of minimizing human suffering, elites can use topics of the war</p>
<p>in Ukraine and climate change and all of those things to sell an idea to the world. And with</p>
<p>disregard to the amount of suffering it causes, their actual actions. So like you can tell all</p>
<p>kinds of narratives. That&rsquo;s the way propaganda works. Hitler really sold the idea that everything</p>
<p>Germany is doing is either it&rsquo;s the victim is defending itself against the cruelty of the world,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually trying to bring out about a better world. So every power center thinks they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing good. And so this is the positive of competition, of having multiple power centers.</p>
<p>This kind of gathering of elites makes me very, very, very nervous. The dinners, the meetings</p>
<p>and the closed rooms. I don&rsquo;t know. But remember we talked about separating our cold analysis of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s likely or possible from what we prefer. And so this isn&rsquo;t exactly enough time for that.</p>
<p>We might say, I would recommend we don&rsquo;t go this route of a strong world governance. And because</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;ll preclude this possibility of becoming rabid aliens, of filling the next</p>
<p>nearest million galaxies for the next billion years with vast amounts of activity and interest</p>
<p>and value of life out there. That&rsquo;s the thing we would lose by deciding that we wouldn&rsquo;t expand,</p>
<p>that we would stay here and keep our comfortable shared governance.</p>
<p>So you wait, you think that global governance is, makes it more likely or less likely that</p>
<p>we expand out into the universe?</p>
<p>Less.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is the key, this is the key point.</p>
<p>Right. Right. So screw the elites.</p>
<p>We want to, wait, do we want to expand?</p>
<p>So again, I want to separate my neutral analysis from my evaluation and say,</p>
<p>first of all, I have an analysis that tells us this is a key choice that we will face and that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s key choice other aliens have faced out there. And it could be that only one in 10 or one in 100</p>
<p>civilizations chooses to expand and the rest of them stay quiet. And that&rsquo;s how it goes out there.</p>
<p>And we face that choice too. And it&rsquo;ll happen sometime in the next 10 million years,</p>
<p>maybe the next thousand. But the key thing to notice from our point of view is that</p>
<p>even though you might like our global governance, you might like the fact that we&rsquo;ve come together,</p>
<p>we no longer have massive wars and we no longer have destructive competition.</p>
<p>And that we could continue that, the cost of continuing that would be to prevent</p>
<p>interstellar colonization. That is once you allow interstellar colonization, then you&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>control of those colonies and whatever they change into, they could come back here and compete with</p>
<p>you back here as a result of having lost control. And I think if people value that global governance</p>
<p>and global community and regulation and all the things it can do enough, they would then</p>
<p>want to prevent interstellar colonization.</p>
<p>I want to have a conversation with those people. I believe that both for humanity,</p>
<p>for the good of humanity, for what I believe is good in humanity and for expansion, exploration,</p>
<p>innovation, distributing the centers of power is very beneficial. So this whole meeting of elites</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to meet quite a large number of elites. They make me nervous</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to lose touch of reality. I&rsquo;m nervous about that in myself to make sure that</p>
<p>you never lose touch as you get sort of older, wiser, you know, how you generally get like</p>
<p>disrespectful of kids, kids these days. No, the kids are okay. But I think you should hear</p>
<p>a stronger case for their position. So I&rsquo;m going to play for the elites. Yes. Well, for the limiting</p>
<p>of expansion and for the regulation of behavior. Okay. Can I link on that? So you&rsquo;re saying those</p>
<p>two are connected. So the human civilization and alien civilizations come to a crossroads.</p>
<p>They have to decide, do we want to expand or not? And connected to that, do we want to give a lot</p>
<p>of power to a central elite? Or do we want to distribute the power centers, which is naturally</p>
<p>connected to the expansion? When you expand, you distribute the power. If say over the next thousand</p>
<p>years, we fill up the solar system, right? We go out from earth and we colonize Mars and we change</p>
<p>a lot of things. Within a solar system, still everything is within reach. That is, if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a rebellious colony around Neptune, you can throw rocks at it and smash it and then teach them</p>
<p>discipline. Okay. A central control over the solar system is feasible. But once you let it escape the</p>
<p>solar system, it&rsquo;s no longer feasible. But if you have a solar system that doesn&rsquo;t have a central</p>
<p>control, maybe broken into a thousand different political units in the solar system, then any one</p>
<p>part of that that allows interstellar colonization and it happens. That is interstellar colonization</p>
<p>happens when only one party chooses to do it and is able to do it. And that&rsquo;s what it is there for.</p>
<p>So we can just say in a world of competition, if interstellar colonization is possible, it will</p>
<p>happen and then competition will continue. And that will sort of ensure the continuation of</p>
<p>competition into the indefinite future. And competition, we don&rsquo;t know, but competition</p>
<p>can take violent forms and many forms. And the case I was going to make is that I think one of</p>
<p>the things that most scares people about competition is not just that it creates holocausts and death</p>
<p>on massive scales, is that it&rsquo;s likely to change who we are and what we value.</p>
<p>Yes. So this is the other thing with power. As we grow, as human civilization grows,</p>
<p>becomes multi planetary, multi solar system potentially, how does that change us, do you think?</p>
<p>I think the more you think about it, the more you realize it can change us a lot.</p>
<p>So first of all, this is pretty dark, by the way. Well, it&rsquo;s just honest.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I&rsquo;m trying to get there. But I think the first thing you should say,</p>
<p>if you look at history, just human history over the last 10,000 years,</p>
<p>if you really understood what people were like a long time ago, you&rsquo;d realize they were really</p>
<p>quite different. Ancient cultures created people who were really quite different. Most historical</p>
<p>fiction lies to you about that. It often offers you modern characters in an ancient world.</p>
<p>But if you actually study history, you will see just how different they were and how differently</p>
<p>they thought. And they&rsquo;ve changed a lot many times, and they&rsquo;ve changed a lot across time.</p>
<p>So I think the most obvious prediction about the future is, even if you only have the mechanisms</p>
<p>of change we&rsquo;ve seen in the past, you should still expect a lot of change in the future.</p>
<p>But we have a lot bigger mechanisms for change in the future than we had in the past.</p>
<p>So I have this book called The Age of M, Work, Love, and Life, and Robots Rule the Earth. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about what happens if brain emulations become possible. So a brain emulation is where you take</p>
<p>a actual human brain, and you scan it and find spatial and chemical detail to create</p>
<p>a computer simulation of that brain. And then those computer simulations of brains</p>
<p>are basically citizens in a new world. They work, and they vote, and they fall in love,</p>
<p>and they get mad, and they lie to each other. And this is a whole new world. And my book is</p>
<p>about analyzing how that world is different than our world, basically using competition as my key</p>
<p>lever of analysis. That is, if that world remains competitive, then I can figure out how they change</p>
<p>in that world, what they do differently than we do. And it&rsquo;s very different. And it&rsquo;s different in</p>
<p>ways that are shocking sometimes to many people and ways some people don&rsquo;t like. I think it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>okay world, but I have to admit, it&rsquo;s quite different. And that&rsquo;s just one technology.</p>
<p>If we add dozens more technologies, changes into the future, we should just expect it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to become very different than who we are. I mean, in the space of all possible minds,</p>
<p>our minds are a particular architecture, a particular structure, a particular set of habits,</p>
<p>and they are only one piece in a vast base of possibilities. The space of possible minds is</p>
<p>really huge. So yeah, let&rsquo;s linger on the space of possible minds for a moment, just to sort of</p>
<p>humble ourselves. How peculiar our peculiarities are, like the fact that we like a particular kind</p>
<p>of sex, and the fact that we eat food through one hole and poop through another hole. And that seems</p>
<p>to be a fundamental aspect of life, is very important to us. And that life is finite in a</p>
<p>certain kind of way, we have a meat vehicle. So death is very important to us. I wonder which</p>
<p>aspects are fundamental, or would be common throughout human history and also throughout,</p>
<p>sorry, throughout history of life on Earth, and throughout other kinds of lives. Like what is</p>
<p>really useful? You mentioned competition seems to be a one fundamental thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to do analysis of where our distant descendants might go in terms of what are robust</p>
<p>features we could predict about our descendants. So again, I have this analysis of sort of the</p>
<p>next generation, so the next era after ours. If you think of human history as having three eras</p>
<p>so far, right? There was the forager era, the farmer era, and the industry era. Then my attempt</p>
<p>in age of M is to analyze the next era after that. And it&rsquo;s very different, but of course,</p>
<p>there could be more and more errors after that. So analyzing a particular scenario and thinking</p>
<p>it through is one way to try to see how different the future could be, but that doesn&rsquo;t give you</p>
<p>some sort of sense of what&rsquo;s typical. But I have tried to analyze what&rsquo;s typical.</p>
<p>And so I have two predictions I think I can make pretty solidly. One thing is that we know at the</p>
<p>moment that humans discount the future rapidly. So we discount the future in terms of caring</p>
<p>about consequences, roughly a factor of two per generation. And there&rsquo;s a solid evolutionary</p>
<p>analysis why sexual creatures would do that. Because basically your descendants only share</p>
<p>half of your genes and your descendants are a generation away. So we only care about our</p>
<p>grandchildren. Basically that&rsquo;s a factor of four later because it&rsquo;s later. So this actually</p>
<p>explains typical interest rates in the economy. That is interest rates are greatly influenced by</p>
<p>our discount rates. And we basically discount the future by a factor of two per generation.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a side effect of the way our preferences evolved as sexually selected</p>
<p>creatures. We should expect that in the longer run creatures will evolve who don&rsquo;t discount the</p>
<p>future. They will care about the long run and they will therefore not neglect the long run.</p>
<p>So for example, for things like global warming or things like that, at the moment, many commenters</p>
<p>are sad that basically ordinary people don&rsquo;t seem to care much, market prices don&rsquo;t seem to care</p>
<p>much and more ordinary people, it doesn&rsquo;t really impact them much because humans don&rsquo;t care much</p>
<p>about the longterm future. And futurists find it hard to motivate people and to engage people about</p>
<p>the longterm future because they just don&rsquo;t care that much. But that&rsquo;s a side effect of this</p>
<p>particular way that our preferences evolved about the future. And so in the future, they will neglect</p>
<p>the future less. And that&rsquo;s an interesting thing that we can predict robustly. Eventually,</p>
<p>you know, maybe a few centuries, maybe longer, eventually our descendants will</p>
<p>care about the future. Can you speak to the intuition behind that? Is it</p>
<p>useful to think more about the future? Right. If evolution rewards creatures for having many</p>
<p>descendants, then if you have decisions that influence how many descendants you have,</p>
<p>then that would be good if you made those decisions. But in order to do that, you&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>care about them. You have to care about that future. So to push back, that&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to maximize the number of descendants. But the nice thing about not caring too much about the</p>
<p>longterm future is you&rsquo;re more likely to take big risks or you&rsquo;re less risk averse. And it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that both evolution and just life in the universe rewards the risk takers. Well, we actually have</p>
<p>analysis of the ideal risk preferences too. So there&rsquo;s a literature on ideal preferences that</p>
<p>evolution should promote. And for example, there&rsquo;s literature on competing investment funds and what</p>
<p>the managers of those funds should care about in terms of risk, various kinds of risks, and in terms</p>
<p>of discounting. And so managers of investment funds should basically have logarithmic risk, i.e. in</p>
<p>shared risk, in correlated risk, but be very risk neutral with respect to uncorrelated risk. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a feature that&rsquo;s predicted to happen about individual personal choices in biology and also</p>
<p>for investment funds. So that&rsquo;s other things. That&rsquo;s also something we can say about the long</p>
<p>run. What&rsquo;s correlated and uncorrelated risk? If there&rsquo;s something that would affect all of your</p>
<p>descendants, then if you take that risk, you might have more descendants, but you might have zero.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just really bad to have zero descendants. But an uncorrelated risk would be a</p>
<p>risk that some of your descendants would suffer, but others wouldn&rsquo;t. And then you have a portfolio</p>
<p>of descendants. And so that portfolio ensures you against problems with any one of them.</p>
<p>I like the idea of portfolio descendants. And we&rsquo;ll talk about portfolios with your idea of</p>
<p>you briefly mentioned, we&rsquo;ll return there with M, EM, the age of EM, work, love, and life when</p>
<p>robots rule the earth. EM, by the way, is emulated minds. So this one of the&hellip;</p>
<p>M is short for emulations.</p>
<p>M is short for emulations. And it&rsquo;s kind of an idea of how we might create artificial minds,</p>
<p>artificial copies of minds, or human like intelligences.</p>
<p>I have another dramatic prediction I can make about long term preferences.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Which is, at the moment, we reproduce as the result of a hodgepodge of preferences that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t very well integrated, but sort of in our ancestral environment induced us to reproduce.</p>
<p>So we have preferences over being sleepy and hungry and thirsty and wanting to have sex and</p>
<p>wanting to be excitement, et cetera, right? And so in our ancestral environment, the packages</p>
<p>of preferences that we evolved to have did induce us to have more descendants. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>But those packages of preferences are not a robust way to promote having more descendants.</p>
<p>They were tied to our ancestral environment, which is no longer true. So that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>reasons we are now having a big fertility decline because in our current environment,</p>
<p>our ancestral preferences are not inducing us to have a lot of kids,</p>
<p>which is, from evolution&rsquo;s point of view, a big mistake.</p>
<p>We can predict that in the longer run, there will arise creatures who</p>
<p>just abstractly know that what they want is more descendants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very robust way to have more descendants is to have that as your direct preference.</p>
<p>First of all, your thinking is so clear. I love it. So mathematical. And thank you</p>
<p>for thinking so clear with me and bearing with my interruptions and going on the tangents when we go</p>
<p>there. So you&rsquo;re just clearly saying that successful long term civilizations will prefer to have</p>
<p>descendants, more descendants.</p>
<p>Not just prefer, consciously and abstractly prefer. That is, it won&rsquo;t be the indirect</p>
<p>consequence of other preference. It will just be the thing they know they want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a president in the future that says, we must have more sex.</p>
<p>We must have more descendants and do whatever it takes to do that.</p>
<p>Whatever. We must go to the moon and do the other things. Not because they&rsquo;re easy,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re hard. But instead of the moon, let&rsquo;s have lots of sex. Okay.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to have descendants, right?</p>
<p>Right. So that&rsquo;s the whole point. When the world gets more complicated and there are many possible</p>
<p>strategies, it&rsquo;s having that as your abstract preference that will force you to think through</p>
<p>those possibilities and pick the one that&rsquo;s most effective.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, descendants doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the narrow definition of</p>
<p>descendants, meaning humans having sex and then having babies.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You can have artificial intelligence systems in whom you instill some capability of cognition</p>
<p>and perhaps even consciousness. You can also create through genetics and biology clones of yourself</p>
<p>or slightly modified clones, thousands of them. So all kinds of descendants. It could be descendants</p>
<p>in the space of ideas too, for somehow we no longer exist in this meat vehicle. It&rsquo;s now just</p>
<p>like whatever the definition of a life form is, you have descendants of those life forms.</p>
<p>Yes. And they will be thoughtful about that. They will have thought about what counts as a</p>
<p>descendant and that&rsquo;ll be important to them to have the right concept.</p>
<p>So the they there is very interesting, who the they are.</p>
<p>But the key thing is we&rsquo;re making predictions that I think are somewhat robust about what</p>
<p>our distant descendants will be like. Another thing I think you would automatically accept is</p>
<p>they will almost entirely be artificial. And I think that would be the obvious prediction</p>
<p>about any aliens we would meet. That is they would long since have given up reproducing</p>
<p>biologically.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like organic or something. It&rsquo;s all real.</p>
<p>It might be squishy and made out of hydrocarbons, but it would be artificial in the sense of made</p>
<p>in factories with designs on CAD things, right? Factories with scale economy. So the factories</p>
<p>we have made on earth today have much larger scale economies than the factories in ourselves.</p>
<p>So the factories in ourselves are, there are marvels, but they don&rsquo;t achieve very many scale</p>
<p>economies. They&rsquo;re tiny little factories.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all factories.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Factories on top of factories. So everything, the factories that are designed is different</p>
<p>than sort of the factories that have evolved.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think the nature of the word design is very interesting to uncover there. But</p>
<p>let me, in terms of aliens, let me go, let me analyze your Twitter like it&rsquo;s Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tweet says, define hello, in quotes, alien civilizations as one that might the</p>
<p>next million years identify humans as intelligent and civilized, travel to earth and say hello</p>
<p>by making their presence and advanced abilities known to us. The next 15 polls, this is a</p>
<p>Twitter thread, the next 15 polls ask about such hello aliens. And what these polls ask</p>
<p>is your Twitter followers, what they think those aliens will be like certain particular</p>
<p>qualities. So poll number one is what percent of hello aliens evolved from biological species</p>
<p>with two main genders? And you know, the popular vote is above 80%. So most of them have two</p>
<p>genders. What do you think about that? I&rsquo;ll ask you about some of these because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so interesting. It&rsquo;s such an interesting question.</p>
<p>It is a fun set of questions.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a fun set of questions. So the genders as we look through evolutionary history, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the usefulness of that as opposed to having just one or like millions?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a question in evolution of life on earth, there are very few species that</p>
<p>have more than two genders. There are some, but they aren&rsquo;t very many. But there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>enormous number of species that do have two genders, much more than one. And so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a literature on why did multiple genders evolve, and that&rsquo;s sort of what&rsquo;s the point of having</p>
<p>males and females versus hermaphrodites. So most plants are hermaphrodites, that is they</p>
<p>would mate male female, but each plant can be either role. And then most animals have</p>
<p>chosen to split into males and females. And then they&rsquo;re differentiating the two genders.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an interesting set of questions about why that happens.</p>
<p>Because you can do selection, you basically have like one gender competes for the affection</p>
<p>of other and there&rsquo;s sexual partnership that creates the offspring. So there&rsquo;s sexual</p>
<p>selection. It&rsquo;s nice to have like to a party, it&rsquo;s nice to have dance partners. And then</p>
<p>then each one get to choose based on certain characteristics. And that&rsquo;s an efficient</p>
<p>mechanism for adapting to the environment, being successfully adapted to the environment.</p>
<p>It does look like there&rsquo;s an advantage. If you have males, then the males can take higher</p>
<p>variants. And so there can be stronger selection among the males in terms of weeding out genetic</p>
<p>mutations because the males have a higher variance in their mating success.</p>
<p>Yes. Sure. Okay. Question number two, what percent of hello aliens evolved from land</p>
<p>animals as opposed to plants or ocean slash air organisms? By the way, I did recently</p>
<p>see that there&rsquo;s only 10% of species on earth are in the ocean. So there&rsquo;s a lot more variety</p>
<p>on land. There is. It&rsquo;s interesting. So why is that? I can&rsquo;t even intuit exactly why that would</p>
<p>be. Maybe survival on land is harder and so you get a lot more. The story that I understand is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about small niches. So speciation can be promoted by having multiple different species.</p>
<p>So in the ocean, species are larger. That is there are more creatures in each species because the</p>
<p>ocean environments don&rsquo;t vary as much. So if you&rsquo;re good in one place, you&rsquo;re good in many</p>
<p>other places. But on land, and especially in rivers, rivers contain an enormous percentage of</p>
<p>the kinds of species on land, you see, because they vary so much from place to place. And so</p>
<p>a species can be good in one place and then other species can&rsquo;t really compete because they came</p>
<p>from a different place where things are different. So it&rsquo;s a remarkable fact actually that speciation</p>
<p>promotes evolution in the long run. That is more evolution has happened on land because there have</p>
<p>been more species on land because each species has been smaller. And that&rsquo;s actually a warning</p>
<p>about something called rot that I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about, which is one of the problems with</p>
<p>even a world government, which is large systems of software today just consistently rot and decay</p>
<p>with time and have to be replaced. And that plausibly also is a problem for other large</p>
<p>systems, including biological systems, legal systems, regulatory systems. And it seems like</p>
<p>large species actually don&rsquo;t evolve as effectively as small ones do. And that&rsquo;s an important thing</p>
<p>to notice about that. And that&rsquo;s different from ordinary sort of evolution in economies on Earth</p>
<p>in the last few centuries, say. On Earth, the more technical evolution and economic growth happens in</p>
<p>larger integrated cities and nations. But in biology, it&rsquo;s the other way around. More evolution</p>
<p>happened in the fragmented species. Yeah, it&rsquo;s such a nuanced discussion because you can also</p>
<p>push back in terms of nations and at least companies. It&rsquo;s like large companies seems to evolve</p>
<p>less effectively. There is something that they have more resources, they don&rsquo;t even have better</p>
<p>resilience. And when you look at the scale of decades and centuries, it seems like a lot of</p>
<p>large companies die. But still large economies do better, like large cities grow better than small</p>
<p>cities. Large integrated economies like the United States or the European Union do better than small</p>
<p>fragmented ones. So, yeah, sure. That&rsquo;s a very interesting, long discussion. But so most of the</p>
<p>people, and obviously votes on Twitter represent the absolute objective truth of things.</p>
<p>But an interesting question about oceans is that, okay, remember I told you about how most</p>
<p>planets would last for trillions of years and be later, right? So people have tried to explain why</p>
<p>life appeared on Earth by saying, oh, all those planets are going to be unqualified for life</p>
<p>because of various problems. That is, they&rsquo;re around smaller stars, which last longer, and</p>
<p>smaller stars have some things like more solar flares, maybe more tidal locking. But almost</p>
<p>all of these problems with longer lived planets aren&rsquo;t problems for ocean worlds. And a large</p>
<p>fraction of planets out there are ocean worlds. So if life can appear on an ocean world, then</p>
<p>that pretty much ensures that these planets that last a very long time could have advanced life</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a huge fraction of ocean worlds. So that&rsquo;s actually an open question.</p>
<p>So when you say, sorry, when you say life appear, you&rsquo;re kind of saying life and intelligent life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an open question. Is land, and that&rsquo;s I suppose the question behind</p>
<p>the Twitter poll, which is a grabby alien civilization that comes to say hello,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the chance that they first began their early steps, the difficult steps they took on</p>
<p>land? What do you think? 80%, most people on Twitter think it&rsquo;s very likely on land.</p>
<p>I think people are discounting ocean worlds too much. That is, I think people tend to assume that</p>
<p>whatever we did must be the only way it&rsquo;s possible. And I think people aren&rsquo;t giving</p>
<p>enough credit for other possible paths. Dolphins, Waterworld, by the way,</p>
<p>people criticize that movie. I love that movie. Kevin Costner can do me no wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, next question. What percent of hello aliens once had a nuclear war with greater</p>
<p>than 10 nukes fired in anger? So not in the incompetence and as an accident,</p>
<p>intentional firing of nukes and less than 20% was the most popular vote.</p>
<p>And that just seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>So like, I wonder what, so most people think once you get nukes, we&rsquo;re not going to fire them.</p>
<p>They believe in the power.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re assuming that if you had a nuclear war, then that would just end</p>
<p>civilization for good. I think that&rsquo;s the thinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main thing.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just wrong. I think you could rise again after a nuclear war.</p>
<p>It might take 10,000 years or 100,000 years, but it could rise again.</p>
<p>So what do you think about mutual assured destruction</p>
<p>as a force to prevent people from firing nuclear weapons? That&rsquo;s a question that I knew</p>
<p>to a terrifying degree has been raised now and what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, clearly it has had an effect. The question is just how strong an effect for how</p>
<p>long. I mean, clearly we have not gone wild with nuclear war and clearly the devastation that you</p>
<p>would get if you initiated a nuclear war is part of the reasons people have been reluctant to start</p>
<p>a war. The question is just how reliably will that ensure the absence of a war?</p>
<p>Yeah. The night is still young.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>This has been 70 years or whatever it&rsquo;s been.</p>
<p>I mean, but what do you think? Do you think we&rsquo;ll see nuclear war in the century?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if in the century, but it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that&rsquo;s likely to happen eventually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very loose statement. Okay. I understand. Now this is where I pull you out of your</p>
<p>mathematical model and ask a human question. Do you think this particular human question&hellip;</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been lucky that it hasn&rsquo;t happened so far.</p>
<p>But what is the nature of nuclear war? Let&rsquo;s think about this. There&rsquo;s dictators, there&rsquo;s democracies,</p>
<p>miscommunication. How do wars start? World War I, World War II.</p>
<p>So the biggest datum here is that we&rsquo;ve had an enormous decline in major war over the last</p>
<p>century. So that has to be taken into account now. So the problem is war is a process that has a very</p>
<p>long tail. That is, there are rare, very large wars. So the average war is much worse than the</p>
<p>median war because of this long tail. And that makes it hard to identify trends over time. So</p>
<p>the median war has clearly gone way down in the last century at a medium rate of war. But it could</p>
<p>be that&rsquo;s because the tail has gotten thicker. And in fact, the average war is just as bad,</p>
<p>but most wars are gonna be big wars. So that&rsquo;s the thing we&rsquo;re not so sure about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no strong data on wars with one, because of the destructive nature of the weapons,</p>
<p>kill hundreds of millions of people. There&rsquo;s no data on this.</p>
<p>So, but we can start intuiting.</p>
<p>But we can see that the power law, we can do a power law fit to the rate of wars and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>power law with a thick tail. So it&rsquo;s one of those things that you should expect most of the damage</p>
<p>to be in the few biggest ones. So that&rsquo;s also true for pandemics and a few other things. For</p>
<p>pandemics, most of the damages in the few biggest ones. So the median pandemics of ours, less than</p>
<p>the average that you should expect in the future. But those, that fitting of data is very questionable</p>
<p>because everything you said is correct. The question is like, what can we infer about the</p>
<p>future of civilization, threatening pandemics or nuclear war from studying the history of the</p>
<p>20th century? So like, you can&rsquo;t just fit it to the data, the rate of wars and the destructive</p>
<p>nature. Like that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not how nuclear war will happen. Nuclear war happens with two</p>
<p>assholes or idiots that have access to a button.</p>
<p>Small wars happen that way too.</p>
<p>No, I understand that, but that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very important. Small wars aside, it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>to understand the dynamics, the human dynamics and the geopolitics of the way nuclear war happens</p>
<p>in order to predict how we can minimize the chance of a&hellip;</p>
<p>But it is a common and useful intellectual strategy to take something that could be really</p>
<p>big or, but is often very small and fit the distribution of the data, small things, which</p>
<p>you have a lot of them and then ask, do I believe the big things are really that different? Right?</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So sometimes it&rsquo;s reasonable to say like, say with tornadoes or even pandemics or something,</p>
<p>the underlying process might not be that different for the big and small ones.</p>
<p>It might not be. The fact that mutual sure destruction seems to work to some degree</p>
<p>shows you that to some degree it&rsquo;s different than the small wars.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really important question to understand is, are humans capable, one human, like how many</p>
<p>humans on earth, if I give them a button now, say you pressing this button will kill everyone on</p>
<p>earth, everyone, right? How many humans will press that button? I want to know those numbers,</p>
<p>like day to day, minute to minute, how many people have that much irresponsibility, evil,</p>
<p>incompetence, ignorance, whatever word you want to assign, there&rsquo;s a lot of dynamics of the</p>
<p>psychology that leads you to press that button, but how many? My intuition is the number, the more</p>
<p>destructive that press of a button, the fewer humans you find. And that number gets very close</p>
<p>to zero very quickly, especially people have access to such a button, but that&rsquo;s perhaps</p>
<p>a hope than a reality. And unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have good data on this,</p>
<p>which is like how destructive are humans willing to be?</p>
<p>So I think part of this just has to think about, ask what your time scales you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>right? So if you say, if you look at the history of war, you know, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of wars pretty</p>
<p>consistently over many centuries. So if I ask, if you ask, will we have a nuclear war in the</p>
<p>next 50 years? I might say, well, probably not. If I say 500 or 5,000 years, like if the same sort</p>
<p>of risks are underlying and they just continue, then you have to add that up over time and think</p>
<p>the risk is getting a lot larger the longer a timescale we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>But okay, let&rsquo;s generalize nuclear war because what I was more referring to is something that</p>
<p>kills more than 20% of humans on earth and injures or makes the other 80%</p>
<p>suffer horribly, survive, but suffer. That&rsquo;s what I was referring to. So when you look at 500 years</p>
<p>from now, that might not be nuclear war. That might be something else. That&rsquo;s that kind of,</p>
<p>has that destructive effect. And I don&rsquo;t know, these feel like novel questions in the history</p>
<p>of humanity. I just don&rsquo;t know. I think since nuclear weapons, this has been, you know,</p>
<p>engineering pandemics, for example, robotics, so nanobots. It just seems like a real new</p>
<p>possibility that we have to contend with it. We don&rsquo;t have good models or from my perspective.</p>
<p>So if you look on say the last thousand years or 10,000 years, we could say we&rsquo;ve seen a certain</p>
<p>rate at which people are willing to make big destruction in terms of war. Okay. And if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to project that data forward, that I think like if you want to ask over periods of</p>
<p>thousands or tens of thousands of years, you would have a reasonable data set. So the key</p>
<p>question is what&rsquo;s changed lately? Okay. And so a big question of which I&rsquo;ve given a lot of thought</p>
<p>to what are the major changes that seem to have happened in culture and human attitudes over the</p>
<p>last few centuries and what&rsquo;s our best explanation for those so that we can project them forward into</p>
<p>the future. And I have a story about that, which is the story that we have been drifting back toward</p>
<p>forager attitudes in the last few centuries as we get rich. So the idea is we spent a million years</p>
<p>being a forager and that was a very sort of standard lifestyle that we know a lot about.</p>
<p>Foragers sort of live in small bands. They make decisions cooperatively. They share food. They,</p>
<p>you know, they don&rsquo;t have much property, et cetera. And humans liked that. And then 10,000 years ago,</p>
<p>farming became possible, but it was only possible because we were plastic enough to really change</p>
<p>our culture. Farming styles and cultures are very different. They have slavery, they have war,</p>
<p>they have property, they have inequality, they have kings. They stay in one place instead of</p>
<p>wandering. They don&rsquo;t have as much diversity of experience or food. They have more disease.</p>
<p>This farming life is just very different. But humans were able to sort of introduce conformity</p>
<p>and religion and all sorts of things to become just a very different kind of creature as farmers.</p>
<p>Farmers are just really different than foragers in terms of their values and their lives.</p>
<p>But the pressures that made foragers into farmers were part mediated by poverty.</p>
<p>Farmers are poor. And if they deviated from the farming norms that people around them supported,</p>
<p>they were quite at risk of starving to death. And then in the last few centuries,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotten rich. And as we&rsquo;ve gotten rich, the social pressures that turned foragers into farmers</p>
<p>have become less persuasive to us. So, for example, a farming young woman who was told,</p>
<p>if you have a child out of wedlock, you and your child may starve, that was a credible threat.</p>
<p>She would see actual examples around her to make that a believable threat. Today,</p>
<p>if you say to a young woman, you shouldn&rsquo;t have a child out of wedlock, she will see other young</p>
<p>woman around her doing okay that way. We&rsquo;re all rich enough to be able to afford that sort of a</p>
<p>thing. And therefore, she&rsquo;s more inclined often to go with her inclinations, her sort of more</p>
<p>natural inclinations about such things rather than to be pressured to follow the official</p>
<p>farming norms of that you shouldn&rsquo;t do that sort of thing. And all through our lives, we have been</p>
<p>drifting back toward forager attitudes because we&rsquo;ve been getting rich. And so, aside from at</p>
<p>work, which is an exception, but elsewhere, I think this explains trends toward less slavery,</p>
<p>more democracy, less religion, less fertility, more promiscuity, more travel, more art, more leisure,</p>
<p>fewer work hours. All of these trends are basically explained by becoming more forager like.</p>
<p>And much science fiction celebrates this, Star Trek or the culture novels, people</p>
<p>like this image that we are moving toward this world. We&rsquo;re basically like foragers, we&rsquo;re peaceful,</p>
<p>we share, we make decisions collectively, we have a lot of free time, we are into art.</p>
<p>So forger, you know, forger is a word and it has, it&rsquo;s a loaded word because it&rsquo;s connected to</p>
<p>the actual, what life was actually like at that time. As you mentioned, we sometimes don&rsquo;t do a</p>
<p>good job of telling accurately what life was like back then. But you&rsquo;re saying if it&rsquo;s not exactly</p>
<p>like foragers, it rhymes in some fundamental way. You also said peaceful. Is it obvious that a</p>
<p>forager with a nuclear weapon would be peaceful? I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s 100% obvious. So we know,</p>
<p>again, we know a fair bit about what foragers lives were like. The main sort of violence they</p>
<p>had would be sexual jealousy. They were relatively promiscuous and so there&rsquo;d be a lot of jealousy.</p>
<p>But they did not have organized wars with each other. That is, they were at peace with their</p>
<p>neighboring forager bands. They didn&rsquo;t have property in land or even in people. They didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have marriage. And so they were, in fact, peaceful.</p>
<p>When you think about large scale wars, they don&rsquo;t start large scale wars.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have coordinated large scale wars like the way chimpanzees do. Our chimpanzees do</p>
<p>have wars between one tribe of chimpanzees and others, but human foragers do not. Farmers return</p>
<p>to that, of course, the more chimpanzee like styles. Well, that&rsquo;s a hopeful message. If we</p>
<p>could return real quick to the Hello Aliens Twitter thread. One of them is really interesting</p>
<p>about language. What percent of Hello Aliens would be able to talk to us in our language?</p>
<p>This is the question of communication. It actually gets to the nature of language.</p>
<p>It also gets to the nature of how advanced you expect them to be.</p>
<p>So I think some people see that we have advanced over the last thousands of years,</p>
<p>and we aren&rsquo;t reaching any sort of limit. And so they tend to assume it could go on forever.</p>
<p>And I actually tend to think that within, say, 10 million years, we will sort of max out on</p>
<p>technology. We will sort of learn everything that&rsquo;s feasible to know for the most part. And then</p>
<p>obstacles to understanding would more be about sort of cultural differences, like ways in which</p>
<p>different places had just chosen to do things differently. And so then the question is, is it</p>
<p>even possible to communicate across some cultural distances? And I could imagine some maybe advanced</p>
<p>aliens who just become so weird and different from each other, they can&rsquo;t communicate with each other.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re probably pretty simple compared to them. So I would think, sure, if they wanted to,</p>
<p>they could communicate with us. So it&rsquo;s the simplicity of the recipient. I tend to,</p>
<p>just to push back, let&rsquo;s explore the possibility where that&rsquo;s not the case. Can we communicate</p>
<p>with ants? I find that this idea that&hellip; We&rsquo;re not very good at communicating in general.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re saying&hellip; All right, I see. You&rsquo;re saying once you get orders of magnitude better</p>
<p>at communicating&hellip; Once they had maxed out on all communication technology in general,</p>
<p>and they just understood in general how to communicate with lots of things, and had done</p>
<p>that for millions of years. But you have to be able to&hellip; This is so interesting. As somebody</p>
<p>who cares a lot about empathy and imagining how other people feel, communication requires empathy,</p>
<p>meaning you have to truly understand how the other person, the other organism sees the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a four dimensional species talking to a two dimensional species. It&rsquo;s not as trivial as,</p>
<p>to me at least, as it might at first seem. So let me reverse my position a little,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll say, well, the hello aliens question really combines two different scenarios</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re slipping over. So one scenario would be that the hello aliens would be like grabby</p>
<p>aliens. They would be just fully advanced. They would have been expanding for millions of years.</p>
<p>They would have a very advanced civilization, and then they would finally be arriving here</p>
<p>after a billion years perhaps of expanding, in which case they&rsquo;re going to be crazy advanced</p>
<p>at some maximal level. But the hello aliens about aliens we might meet soon, which might be sort of</p>
<p>UFO aliens, and UFO aliens probably are not grabby aliens. How do you get here if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not a grabby alien? Well, they would have to be able to travel. Oh. But they would not be expansive.</p>
<p>So the road trip doesn&rsquo;t count as a grabby. So we&rsquo;re talking about expanding the colony,</p>
<p>the comfortable colony. So the question is, if UFOs, some of them are aliens,</p>
<p>what kind of aliens would they be? This is sort of the key question you have to ask in order to</p>
<p>try to interpret that scenario. The key fact we would know is that they are here right now,</p>
<p>but the universe around us is not full of an alien civilization. So that says right off the bat</p>
<p>that they chose not to allow massive expansion of a grabby civilization.</p>
<p>Is it possible that they chose it, but we just don&rsquo;t see them yet? These are the stragglers,</p>
<p>the journeymen. So the timing coincidence is, it&rsquo;s almost surely if they are here now,</p>
<p>they are much older than us. They are many millions of years older than us. And so they</p>
<p>could have filled the galaxy in that last millions of years if they had wanted to.</p>
<p>That is, they couldn&rsquo;t just be right at the edge. Very unlikely. Most likely they would have been</p>
<p>around waiting for us for a long time. They could have come here any time in the last millions of</p>
<p>years and they just chosen, they&rsquo;ve been waiting around for this or they just chose to come</p>
<p>recently. But the timing coincidence, it would be crazy unlikely that they just happen to be able to</p>
<p>get here, say in the last hundred years. They would no doubt have been able to get here far</p>
<p>earlier than that. Again, we don&rsquo;t know. So this is a friend like UFO sightings on earth. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if this kind of increase in sightings have anything to do with actual visitations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking about the timing. They arose at some point in space time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very unlikely that that was just to the point that they could just barely get here</p>
<p>recently. Almost surely they could have gotten here much earlier. And throughout the stretch</p>
<p>of several billion years that earth existed, they could have been here often. Exactly. So</p>
<p>they could have therefore filled the galaxy long time ago if they had wanted to. Let&rsquo;s push back</p>
<p>on that. The question to me is, isn&rsquo;t it possible that the expansion of a civilization is much</p>
<p>harder than the travel? The sphere of the reachable is different than the sphere of the colonized.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t it possible that the sphere of places where like the stragglers go, the different</p>
<p>people that journey out, the explorers, is much, much larger and grows much faster than the</p>
<p>civilization? So in which case, like they would visit us. There&rsquo;s a lot of visitors, the grad</p>
<p>students of the civilization. They&rsquo;re like exploring, they&rsquo;re collecting the data, but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not yet going to see them. And by yet, I mean across millions of years.</p>
<p>The time delay between when the first thing might arrive and then when colonists could arrive in</p>
<p>mass and do a mass amount of work is cosmologically short. In human history, of course, sure, there</p>
<p>might be a century between that, but a century is just a tiny amount of time on the scales we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about. So this is, in computer science, ant colony optimization. It&rsquo;s true for ants.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like when the first ant shows up, it&rsquo;s likely if there&rsquo;s anything of value,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely the other ants will follow quickly. Yeah.</p>
<p>Relatively short. It&rsquo;s also true that traveling over very long distances, probably one of the</p>
<p>main ways to make that feasible is that you land somewhere, you colonize a bit, you create new</p>
<p>resources that can then allow you to go farther. Many short hops as opposed to a giant long journey.</p>
<p>Exactly. Those hops require that you are able to start a colonization of sorts along those hops.</p>
<p>You have to be able to stop somewhere, make it into a way station such that you can then support</p>
<p>you moving farther. So what do you think of, there&rsquo;s been a lot of UFO sightings. What do</p>
<p>you think about those UFO sightings and what do you think if any of them are of extraterrestrial</p>
<p>origin and we don&rsquo;t see giant civilizations out in the sky, how do you make sense of that then?</p>
<p>I want to do some clearing of throats, which people like to do on this topic, right? They want</p>
<p>to make sure you understand they&rsquo;re saying this and not that, right? So I would say the analysis</p>
<p>needs both a prior and a likelihood. So the prior is what are the scenarios that are at all plausible</p>
<p>in terms of what we know about the universe. And then the likelihood is the particular actual</p>
<p>sightings, like how hard are those to explain through various means. I will establish myself</p>
<p>as somewhat of an expert on the prior. I would say my studies and the things I&rsquo;ve studied make me an</p>
<p>expert and I should stand up and have an opinion on that and be able to explain it. The likelihood,</p>
<p>however, is not my area of expertise. That is, I&rsquo;m not a pilot. I don&rsquo;t do atmospheric studies of</p>
<p>studies of things I haven&rsquo;t studied in detail, the various kinds of atmospheric phenomena or</p>
<p>whatever that might be used to explain the particular sightings. I can just say from</p>
<p>my amateur stance, the sightings look damn puzzling. They do not look easy to dismiss.</p>
<p>The attempts I&rsquo;ve seen to easily dismiss them seem to me to fail. It seems like these are</p>
<p>pretty puzzling, weird stuff that deserve an expert&rsquo;s attention in terms of considering,</p>
<p>asking what the likelihood is. So analogy I would make as a murder trial. On average, if we say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the chance any one person murdered another person as a prior probability, maybe one in a</p>
<p>thousand people get murdered. Maybe each person has a thousand people around them who could</p>
<p>plausibly have done it. So the prior probability of a murder is one in a million. But we allow</p>
<p>murder trials because often evidence is sufficient to overcome a one in a million prior because the</p>
<p>evidence is often strong enough, right? My guess, rough guess for the UFOs as aliens</p>
<p>scenario, at least some of them, is the priors roughly one in a thousand,</p>
<p>much higher than the usual murder trial, plenty high enough that strong physical evidence could</p>
<p>put you over the top to think it&rsquo;s more likely than not. But I&rsquo;m not an expert on that physical</p>
<p>evidence. I&rsquo;m going to leave that part to someone else. I&rsquo;m going to say the prior is pretty high.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a crazy scenario. So then I can elaborate on where my prior comes from.</p>
<p>What scenario could make most sense of this data? My scenario to make sense has two main parts.</p>
<p>First is panspermia siblings. So panspermia is the process by which life might have arrived on</p>
<p>earth from elsewhere. And a plausible time for that, I mean, it would have to happen very early</p>
<p>in earth&rsquo;s history because we see life early in history. And a plausible time could have been</p>
<p>during the stellar nursery where the sun was born with many other stars in the same close proximity</p>
<p>with lots of rocks flying around, able to move things from one place to another.</p>
<p>If a rock with life on it from some rock with planet with life came into that stellar nursery,</p>
<p>it plausibly could have seeded many planets in that stellar nursery all at the same time. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all born at the same time in the same place, pretty close to each other, lots of rocks flying</p>
<p>around. So a panspermia scenario would then create siblings, i.e. there would be, say, a few thousand</p>
<p>other planets out there. So after the nursery forms, it drifts, it separates, they drift apart.</p>
<p>And so out there in the galaxy, there would now be a bunch of other stars all formed at the same</p>
<p>time. And we can actually spot them in terms of their spectrum. And they would have then started</p>
<p>on the same path of life as we did with that life being seeded, but they would move at different</p>
<p>rates. And most likely, most of them would never reach an advanced level before the deadline. But</p>
<p>maybe one other did, and maybe it did before us. So if they did, they could know all this,</p>
<p>and they could go searching for their siblings. That is, they could look in the sky for the other</p>
<p>stars that match the spectrum that matches the spectrum that came from this nursery.</p>
<p>They could identify their sibling stars in the galaxy, the thousand of them. And those would be</p>
<p>of special interest to them because they would think, well, life might be on those. And they</p>
<p>could go looking for them. Can we just, such a brilliant mathematical, philosophical, physical,</p>
<p>biological idea of panspermia siblings, because we all kind of started at a similar time</p>
<p>in this local pocket of the universe. And so that changes a lot of the math.</p>
<p>So that would create this correlation between when advanced life might appear,</p>
<p>no longer just random independent spaces and space time. There&rsquo;d be this cluster, perhaps.</p>
<p>And that allows interaction between non grabby alien civilizations, like kind of</p>
<p>primitive alien civilizations, like us with others. And they might be a little bit ahead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>They would probably be a lot ahead. So the puzzle is, if they happened before us,</p>
<p>they probably happened hundreds of millions of years before us.</p>
<p>But less than a billion.</p>
<p>Less than a billion, but still plenty of time that they could have become grabby and filled</p>
<p>the galaxy and gone beyond. So the fact is, they chose not to become grabby. That would</p>
<p>have to be the interpretation. If we have panspermia siblings&hellip;</p>
<p>Plenty of time to become grabby, you said. So they should be gone.</p>
<p>Yes, they had plenty of time and they chose not to.</p>
<p>Are we sure about this? A hundred million years is enough.</p>
<p>So I told you before that I said, within 10 million years, our descendants will become</p>
<p>grabby or not.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll have that choice. Okay.</p>
<p>Right? And so they, clearly more than 10 million years earlier than us, so they chose not to.</p>
<p>But still go on vacation, look around, just not grabby.</p>
<p>If they chose not to expand, that&rsquo;s going to have to be a rule they set to not allow</p>
<p>any part of themselves to do it. If they let any little ship fly away with the ability</p>
<p>to create a colony, the game&rsquo;s over. Then the universe becomes grabby from their origin</p>
<p>with this one colony, right? So in order to prevent their civilization being grabby,</p>
<p>they have to have a rule they enforce pretty strongly that no part of them can ever try</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>Through a global authoritarian regime or through something that&rsquo;s internal to them,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s part of the nature of life that it doesn&rsquo;t want&hellip;</p>
<p>As like a political officer in the brain or whatever.</p>
<p>Yes. There&rsquo;s something in human nature that prevents you from what or like alien nature</p>
<p>that as you get more advanced, you become lazier and lazier in terms of exploration</p>
<p>and expansion.</p>
<p>So I would say they would have to have enforced a rule against expanding and that rule would</p>
<p>probably make them reluctant to let people leave very far. You know, any one vacation</p>
<p>trip far away could risk an expansion from this vacation trip. So they would probably</p>
<p>have a pretty tight lid on just allowing any travel out from their origin in order to</p>
<p>enforce this rule. But then we also know, well, they would have chosen to come here.</p>
<p>So clearly they made an exception from their general rule to say, okay, but an expedition</p>
<p>to Earth, that should be allowed.</p>
<p>It could be intentional exception or incompetent exception.</p>
<p>But if incompetent, then they couldn&rsquo;t maintain this over 100 million years, this policy of</p>
<p>not allowing any expansion. So we have to see they have successfully, they not just</p>
<p>had a policy to try, they succeeded over 100 million years in preventing the expansion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a substantial competence.</p>
<p>Let me think about this. So you don&rsquo;t think there could be a barrier in 100 million years,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think there could be a barrier to like technological barrier to becoming expansionary.</p>
<p>Imagine the Europeans have tried to prevent anybody from leaving Europe to go to the new</p>
<p>world. And imagine what it would have taken to make that happen over 100 million years.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>They would have had to have very strict, you know, guards at the borders saying, no, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>But just to clarify, you&rsquo;re not suggesting that&rsquo;s actually possible.</p>
<p>I am suggesting it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you keep, in my silly human brain, maybe it&rsquo;s the brain that values freedom,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know how you can keep, no matter how much force, no matter how much censorship</p>
<p>or control or so on, I just don&rsquo;t know how you can keep people from exploring into the</p>
<p>mysterious, into the unknown.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking of people, we&rsquo;re talking aliens. So remember, there&rsquo;s a vast space</p>
<p>of different possible social creatures they could have evolved from, different cultures</p>
<p>they could be in, different kinds of threats. I mean, there are many things, as you talked</p>
<p>about, that most of us would feel very reluctant to do.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t one of those.</p>
<p>Okay, so how, if the UFO sightings represent alien visitors, how the heck are they getting</p>
<p>here under the panspermia siblings?</p>
<p>So panspermia siblings is one part of the scenario, which is that&rsquo;s where they came</p>
<p>from. And from that, we can conclude they had this rule against expansion and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>successfully enforced that. That also creates a plausible agenda for why they would be here,</p>
<p>that is to enforce that rule on us. That is, if we go out and expanding, then we have defeated</p>
<p>the purpose of this rule they set up.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Right? So they would be here to convince us to not expand.</p>
<p>Convince in quotes.</p>
<p>Right? Through various mechanisms. So obviously, one thing we conclude is they didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>destroy us. That would have been completely possible, right? So the fact that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here and we are not destroyed means that they chose not to destroy us. They have some degree</p>
<p>of empathy or whatever their morals are that would make them reluctant to just destroy</p>
<p>us. They would rather persuade us.</p>
<p>Destroy their brethren. And so they may have been, there&rsquo;s a difference in arrival and</p>
<p>observation. They may have been observing for a very long time.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And they arrive to try to, not to try, I don&rsquo;t think to try to ensure that we don&rsquo;t become</p>
<p>grabby.</p>
<p>Which is because we can see that they did not, they must have enforced a rule against</p>
<p>that and they are therefore here to, that&rsquo;s a plausible interpretation why they would</p>
<p>risk this expedition when they clearly don&rsquo;t risk very many expeditions over this long</p>
<p>period to allow this one exception because otherwise, if they don&rsquo;t, we may become grabby.</p>
<p>And they could have just destroyed us, but they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re closely monitoring the technological advancing of our civilization. Like what</p>
<p>nuclear weapons is one thing that, all right, cool. That might have less to do with nuclear</p>
<p>weapons and more with nuclear energy. Maybe they&rsquo;re monitoring fusion closely. Like how</p>
<p>clever are these apes getting?</p>
<p>So no doubt they have a button that if we get too uppity or risky, they can push the</p>
<p>button and ensure that we don&rsquo;t expand. But they&rsquo;d rather do it some other way. So now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that explains why they&rsquo;re here and why they aren&rsquo;t out there. But there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that we need to explain. There&rsquo;s another key data we need to explain about UFOs if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have a hypothesis that explains them. And this is something many people have</p>
<p>noticed, which is they had two extreme options they could have chosen and didn&rsquo;t chose.</p>
<p>They could have either just remained completely invisible. Clearly an advanced civilization</p>
<p>could have been completely invisible. There&rsquo;s no reason they need to fly around and be</p>
<p>noticed. They could just be in orbit and in dark satellites that are completely invisible</p>
<p>to us watching whatever they want to watch. That would be well within their abilities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing they could have done. The other thing they could do is just show up</p>
<p>and land on the White House lawn, as they say, and shake hands, like make themselves</p>
<p>really obvious. They could have done either of those and they didn&rsquo;t do either of those.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next thing you need to explain about UFOs as aliens. Why would they take</p>
<p>this intermediate approach, hanging out near the edge of visibility with somewhat impressive</p>
<p>mechanisms, but not walking up and introducing themselves nor just being completely invisible?</p>
<p>So, okay, a lot of questions there. So one, do you think it&rsquo;s obvious where the White</p>
<p>House is or the White House lawn?</p>
<p>Obvious where there are concentrations of humans that you could go up and introduce.</p>
<p>But is humans the most interesting thing about Earth?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you sure about this? Because&hellip;</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re worried about an expansion, then they would be worried about a civilization</p>
<p>that could be capable of expansion. Obviously humans are the civilization on Earth that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>by far the closest to being able to expand.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know if aliens obviously see&hellip;obviously see humans, like the individual</p>
<p>humans, like the meat vehicles, as the center of focus for observing a life on a planet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to be really smart and advanced. Like, this shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard for them.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re actually the dumb ones, because we think humans are the important</p>
<p>things. But it could be our ideas. It could be something about our technologies.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s mediated with us. It&rsquo;s correlated with us.</p>
<p>No, we make it seem like it&rsquo;s mediated by us humans. But the focus for alien civilizations</p>
<p>might be the AI systems or the technologies themselves. That might be the organism. Like,</p>
<p>what humans are like&hellip;human is the food, the source of the organism that&rsquo;s under observation,</p>
<p>versus like&hellip;</p>
<p>So what they wanted to have close contact with was something that was closely near humans,</p>
<p>then they would be contacting those. And we would just incidentally see, but we would still see.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think that&hellip;isn&rsquo;t it possible, taking their perspective,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it possible that they would want to interact with some fundamental aspect that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re interested in without interfering with it? And that&rsquo;s actually a very&hellip;no</p>
<p>matter how advanced you are, it&rsquo;s very difficult to do.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s puzzling. So, I mean, the prototypical UFO observation is a shiny,</p>
<p>big object in the sky that has very rapid acceleration and no apparent surfaces for</p>
<p>using air to manipulate at speed. And the question is, why that? Again, if they just&hellip;</p>
<p>For example, if they just wanted to talk to our computer systems, they could move some sort of</p>
<p>like a little probe that connects to a wire and reads and sends bits there. They don&rsquo;t need a</p>
<p>shiny thing flying in the sky.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think they would be looking for the right way to communicate, the right</p>
<p>language to communicate? Everything you just said, looking at the computer systems,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not a trivial thing. Coming up with a signal that us humans would not freak out</p>
<p>too much about, but also understand, might not be that trivial.</p>
<p>Well, so the not freak out part is another interesting constraint. So again, I said,</p>
<p>like the two obvious strategies are just to remain completely invisible and watch,</p>
<p>which would be quite feasible, or to just directly interact, come out and be really</p>
<p>very direct, right? I mean, there&rsquo;s big things that you can see around. There&rsquo;s big cities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s aircraft carriers, there&rsquo;s lots of&hellip; If you want to just find a big thing and come</p>
<p>right up to it and like tap it on the shoulder or whatever, that would be quite feasible,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re not doing that. So my hypothesis is that one of the other questions there was,</p>
<p>do they have a status hierarchy? And I think most animals on earth who are social animals</p>
<p>who are social animals have status hierarchy, and they would reasonably presume that we have</p>
<p>a status hierarchy. And&hellip;</p>
<p>Take me to your leader.</p>
<p>Well, I would say their strategy is to be impressive and sort of get us to see them</p>
<p>at the top of our status hierarchy. That&rsquo;s how, for example, we domesticate dogs, right?</p>
<p>We convince dogs we&rsquo;re the leader of their pack, right? And we domesticate many animals that way,</p>
<p>but as we just swap into the top of their status hierarchy and we say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re your top status animal, so you should do what we say, you should follow our lead.</p>
<p>So the idea that would be, they are going to get us to do what they want by being top status.</p>
<p>You know, all through history, kings and emperors, et cetera, have tried to impress their citizens</p>
<p>and other people by having the bigger palace, the bigger parade, the bigger crown and</p>
<p>diamonds, right? Whatever, maybe building a bigger pyramid, et cetera. It&rsquo;s a very well</p>
<p>established trend to just be high status by being more impressive than the rest.</p>
<p>To push back when there&rsquo;s an order of several orders of magnitude of power differential,</p>
<p>asymmetry of power, I feel like that status hierarchy no longer applies. It&rsquo;s like memetic</p>
<p>theory. It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>Most emperors are several orders of magnitude more powerful than any one member of their empire.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s increase that by even more. So like if I&rsquo;m interacting with ants,</p>
<p>I no longer feel like I need to establish my power with ants. I actually want to lower myself</p>
<p>to the ants. I want to become the lowest possible ant so that they would welcome me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m less concerned about them worshiping me. I&rsquo;m more concerned about them welcoming me.</p>
<p>It is important that you be nonthreatening and that you be local. So I think</p>
<p>for example, if the aliens had done something really big in the sky, 100 light years away,</p>
<p>that would be there, not here. And that could seem threatening. So I think their strategy to</p>
<p>be the high status would have to be to be visible, but to be here and nonthreatening.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s obvious how to do that. Take your own perspective. You see a planet</p>
<p>with relatively intelligent complex structures being formed, life forms. You could see this</p>
<p>under in Titan or something like that, Europa. You start to see not just primitive bacterial</p>
<p>life, but multicellular life. And it seems to form some very complicated cellular colonies,</p>
<p>structures that they&rsquo;re dynamic. There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on. Some gigantic cellular automata</p>
<p>type of construct. How do you make yourself known to them in an impressive fashion</p>
<p>without destroying it? We know how to destroy potentially.</p>
<p>Right. So if you go touch stuff, you&rsquo;re likely to hurt it, right? There&rsquo;s a good risk of hurting</p>
<p>something by getting too close and touching it and interacting, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, like landing on a White House lawn.</p>
<p>Right. So the claim is that their current strategy of hanging out at the periphery of</p>
<p>our vision and just being very clearly physically impressive with very clear physically impressive</p>
<p>abilities is at least a plausible strategy they might use to impress us and convince us sort of</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the top of their status hierarchy. And I would say if they came closer, not only would</p>
<p>they risk hurting us in ways that they couldn&rsquo;t really understand, but more plausibly, they would</p>
<p>reveal things about themselves we would hate. So if you look at how we treat other civilizations</p>
<p>on Earth and other people, we are generally interested in foreigners and people from other</p>
<p>plant lands. And we were generally interested in their varying cult customs, et cetera,</p>
<p>until we find out that they do something that violates our moral norms and then we hate them.</p>
<p>And these are aliens for God&rsquo;s sakes, right? There&rsquo;s just going to be something about them</p>
<p>that we hate. They eat babies. Who knows what it is? Something they don&rsquo;t think is offensive,</p>
<p>but that they think we might find. And so they would be risking a lot by revealing a lot about</p>
<p>themselves. We would find something we hated. Interesting. But do you resonate at all with</p>
<p>memetic theory where like, we only feel this way about things that are very close to us.</p>
<p>So aliens are sufficiently different to where we&rsquo;ll be like, fascinated, terrified or fascinated,</p>
<p>but not like. Right, but if they want to be at the top of our status hierarchy to get us to</p>
<p>follow them, they can&rsquo;t be too distant. They have to be close enough that we would see them that</p>
<p>way. But pretend to be close enough. Right. And not reveal much that mystery that old Clint Eastwood</p>
<p>cowboy. I mean, we&rsquo;re clever enough that we can figure out their agenda. That is just from the</p>
<p>fact that we&rsquo;re here. If we see that they&rsquo;re here, we can figure out, Oh, they want us not to expand</p>
<p>and look, they are this huge power and they&rsquo;re very impressive. So, and a lot of us don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to expand. So that could easily tip us over the edge toward we already wanted to not expand. We</p>
<p>already wanted to be able to regulate and have a central community. And here are these very advanced</p>
<p>smart aliens who have survived for a hundred million years and they&rsquo;re telling us not to expand</p>
<p>either. This is brilliant. I love this so much. Uh, the, the, so returning to panspermia siblings,</p>
<p>just to clarify one thing in that framework, how would, who originated, who planted it?</p>
<p>Would it be a grabby alien civilization that planted the siblings or no? The simple scenario</p>
<p>is that life started on some other planet billions of years ago and it went through part of the</p>
<p>stages of evolution to advance life, but not all the way to advance life. And then some rock hit</p>
<p>it, grabbed a piece of it on the rock and that rock drifted for maybe in a million years until</p>
<p>it happened to prong the stellar nursery where it then seeded many stars. And something about that</p>
<p>life without being super advanced, it was nevertheless resilient to the harsh conditions</p>
<p>of space. There&rsquo;s some graphs that I&rsquo;ve been impressed by that show sort of the level of</p>
<p>genetic information in various kinds of life on the history of earth. And basically we are now</p>
<p>more complex than the earlier life, but the earlier life was still pretty complex. And so if</p>
<p>you actually project this log graph in history, it looks like it was many billions of years ago</p>
<p>when you get down to zero. So like plausible, you could say there was just a lot of evolution that</p>
<p>had to happen before you to get to the simplest life we&rsquo;ve ever seen in history of life on earth</p>
<p>was still pretty damn complicated. Okay. And so that race, that&rsquo;s always been this puzzle. How</p>
<p>could life get to this enormously complicated level in the short period it seems to at the</p>
<p>beginning of earth history. So where, you know, it&rsquo;s only 300 million years at most when it</p>
<p>appeared. And then it was really complicated at that point. So panspermia allows you to</p>
<p>explain that complexity by saying, well, it&rsquo;s been another 5 billion years on another planet</p>
<p>going through lots of earlier stages where it was working its way up to the level of</p>
<p>complexity you see at the beginning of earth. We&rsquo;ll try to talk about other ideas of the</p>
<p>origin of life, but let me return to UFO sightings. Is there other explanations that are possible</p>
<p>outside of panspermia siblings that can explain no grabby aliens in the sky and yet alien arrival</p>
<p>on earth? Well, the other categories of explanations that most people will use is, well,</p>
<p>first of all, just mistakes, like, you know, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re confusing something</p>
<p>ordinary for something mysterious, right? Or some sort of secret organization, like our</p>
<p>government is secretly messing with us and trying to do a, you know, a false flag ops</p>
<p>or whatever, right? You know, they&rsquo;re trying to convince the Russians or the Chinese that</p>
<p>there might be aliens and scare them into not attacking or something, right? Because</p>
<p>if you, you know, the history of World War II, say the US government did all these big</p>
<p>fake operations where they were faking a lot of big things in order to mess with people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a possibility. The government has been lying and, you know, faking things and</p>
<p>paying people to lie about what they saw, et cetera. That&rsquo;s a plausible set of explanations</p>
<p>for the range of sightings seen. And another explanation people offer is some other hidden</p>
<p>organization on earth or some, you know, secret organization somewhere that has much more</p>
<p>advanced capabilities than anybody&rsquo;s given a credit for, for some reason it&rsquo;s been keeping</p>
<p>secret. I mean, they all sound somewhat implausible, but again, we&rsquo;re looking for maybe,</p>
<p>you know, one in a thousand sort of priors. Question is, you know, could, could they be</p>
<p>in that level of plausibility? Can we just linger on this? So you, first of all, you&rsquo;ve written,</p>
<p>talked about, thought about so many different topics. You&rsquo;re an incredible mind. And I just</p>
<p>thank you for sitting down today. I&rsquo;m almost like at a loss of which place we explore,</p>
<p>but let me on this topic, ask about conspiracy theories because you&rsquo;ve written about institutions</p>
<p>authorities. What, this is a bit of a therapy session, but what do we make of conspiracy</p>
<p>theories? The phrase itself is pushing you in a direction, right? So clearly in history,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had many large coordinated keepings of secrets, right? Say the Manhattan project,</p>
<p>right? And there was hundreds of thousands of people working on that over many years,</p>
<p>but they kept it a secret, right? Clearly many large military operations have kept things secrets</p>
<p>over, you know, even decades with many thousands of people involved. So clearly it&rsquo;s possible to</p>
<p>keep some things secret over time periods. You know, but the more people you involve and the</p>
<p>more time you are assuming and the more, the less centralized an organization or the less</p>
<p>discipline they have, the harder it gets to believe. But we&rsquo;re just trying to calibrate</p>
<p>basically in our minds, which kind of secrets can be kept by which groups over what time periods</p>
<p>for what purposes, right? But let me, I don&rsquo;t have enough data. So I&rsquo;m somebody, I, you know,</p>
<p>I hang out with people and I love people. I love all things really. And I just, I think that most</p>
<p>people, even the assholes have the capacity to be good and they&rsquo;re beautiful and I enjoy them.</p>
<p>So the kind of data, my brain, whatever the chemistry of my brain is that sees the beautiful</p>
<p>in things is maybe collecting a subset of data that doesn&rsquo;t allow me to intuit the competence</p>
<p>that humans are able to achieve in constructing a conspiracy theory. So for example, one thing</p>
<p>that people often talk about is like intelligence agencies, this like broad thing. They say the CIA,</p>
<p>the FSB, the different, the British intelligence. I&rsquo;ve fortunate or unfortunate enough, never gotten</p>
<p>the chance that I know of to talk to any member of those intelligence agencies nor like take a</p>
<p>peek behind the curtain or the first curtain. I don&rsquo;t know how many levels of curtains there are.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t intuit my interactions with government. I was funded by DOD and DARPA</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve interacted, been to the Pentagon, like with all due respect to my friends, lovely friends</p>
<p>in government. And there are a lot of incredible people, but there is a very giant bureaucracy</p>
<p>that sometimes suffocates the ingenuity of the human spirit is one way I can put it. Meaning</p>
<p>they are, I just, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to imagine extreme competence at a scale of hundreds or</p>
<p>thousands human beings. Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s my very anecdotal data of the situation.</p>
<p>And so I try to build up my intuition about centralized system of government, how much</p>
<p>conspiracy is possible, how much the intelligence agencies or some other source can generate</p>
<p>sufficiently robust propaganda that controls the populace. If you look at World War II, as you</p>
<p>mentioned, there&rsquo;ve been extremely powerful propaganda machines on the Nazi, on the side of</p>
<p>Nazi Germany, on the side of the Soviet Union, on the side of the United States and all these different</p>
<p>mechanisms. Sometimes they control the free press through social pressures. Sometimes they control</p>
<p>the press through the threat of violence, as you do in authoritarian regimes. Sometimes it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>deliberately the dictator, like writing the news, the headlines and literally announcing it. And</p>
<p>something about human psychology forces you to embrace the narrative and believe the narrative.</p>
<p>And at scale that becomes reality when the initial spark was just the propaganda thought in a single</p>
<p>individual&rsquo;s mind. So I can&rsquo;t necessarily intuit of what&rsquo;s possible, but I&rsquo;m skeptical of the power</p>
<p>of human institutions to construct conspiracy theories that cause suffering at scale, especially</p>
<p>in this modern age when information is becoming more and more accessible by the populace. Anyway,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the, I don&rsquo;t know if you can elucidate for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called suffering at scale, but of course, say during wartime, the people who are managing</p>
<p>the various conspiracies like D Day or Manhattan Project, they thought that their conspiracy was</p>
<p>avoiding harm rather than causing harm. So if you can get a lot of people to think that supporting</p>
<p>the conspiracy is helpful, then a lot more might do that. And there&rsquo;s just a lot of things that</p>
<p>people just don&rsquo;t want to see. So if you can make your conspiracy the sort of thing that people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to talk about anyway, even if they knew about it, you&rsquo;re most of the way there.</p>
<p>So I have learned many over the years, many things that most ordinary people would never want to</p>
<p>hear, many things that most ordinary people should be interested in, but somehow don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>even though the data has been very widespread. So I have this book, The Elephant and the Brain,</p>
<p>and one of the chapters is there on medicine. And basically, most people seem ignorant of the very</p>
<p>basic fact that when we do randomized trials where we give some people more medicine than others,</p>
<p>the people who get more medicine are not healthier. Just overall, in general, just like</p>
<p>induce somebody to get more medicine because you just give them more budget to buy medicine, say.</p>
<p>And not a specific medicine, just the whole category. And you would think that would be</p>
<p>something most people should know about medicine. You might even think that would be a conspiracy</p>
<p>theory to think that would be hidden, but in fact, most people never learn that fact.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, just a general high level statement, the more medicine you take,</p>
<p>the less healthy you are.</p>
<p>Randomized experiments don&rsquo;t find that fact. Do not find that more medicine makes you more healthy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no connection. In randomized experiments, there&rsquo;s no relationship between</p>
<p>more medicine and being healthier.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a negative relationship, but it&rsquo;s just no relationship.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so the conspiracy theory would say that the businesses that sell you medicine don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>to know that fact. And then you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s also part of this is that people just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to know.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t want to know. And so they don&rsquo;t learn this. So I&rsquo;ve lived in the Washington area</p>
<p>for several decades now, reading the Washington Post regularly. Every week there was a special</p>
<p>section on health and medicine. It never was mentioned in that section of the paper</p>
<p>in all the 20 years I read that.</p>
<p>So do you think there is some truth to this caricatured blue pill, red pill,</p>
<p>where most people don&rsquo;t want to know the truth?</p>
<p>There are many things about which people don&rsquo;t want to know certain kinds of truths.</p>
<p>Yeah. That is bad looking truths, truths that discouraging, truths that sort of take away the</p>
<p>justification for things they feel passionate about.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a bad aspect of human nature? That&rsquo;s something we should try to overcome?</p>
<p>Well, as we discussed, my first priority is to just tell people about it, to do the analysis</p>
<p>and the cold facts of what&rsquo;s actually happening, and then to try to be careful about how we can</p>
<p>improve. So our book, The Elephant in the Rain, coauthored with Kevin Simler, is about how we</p>
<p>hide motives in everyday life. And our first priority there is just to explain to you what are</p>
<p>the things that you are not looking at that you have reluctant to look at. And many people try</p>
<p>to take that book as a self help book where they&rsquo;re trying to improve themselves and make</p>
<p>sure they look at more things. And that often goes badly because it&rsquo;s harder to actually do</p>
<p>that than you think. But we at least want you to know that this truth is available if you want</p>
<p>to learn about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Nietzsche, if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. Let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>this elephant in the brain. Amazing book. The elephant in the room is, quote, an important</p>
<p>issue that people are reluctant to acknowledge or address a social taboo. The elephant in the brain</p>
<p>is an important but unacknowledged feature of how our mind works, an introspective taboo.</p>
<p>You describe selfishness and self deception as the core or some of the core elephants,</p>
<p>some of the elephants, elephant offspring in the brain. Selfishness and self deception.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Can you explain, can you explain why these are the taboos in our brain that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to acknowledge to ourselves?</p>
<p>Your conscious mind, the one that&rsquo;s listening to me that I&rsquo;m talking to at the moment, you like</p>
<p>to think of yourself as the president or king of your mind, ruling over all that you see,</p>
<p>issuing commands that immediately obeyed. You are instead better understood as the press secretary</p>
<p>of your brain. You don&rsquo;t make decisions. You justify them to an audience. That&rsquo;s what your</p>
<p>conscious mind is for. You watch what you&rsquo;re doing and you try to come up with stories that explain</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing so that you can avoid accusations of violating norms. So humans compared to most</p>
<p>other animals have norms, and this allows us to manage larger groups with our morals and norms</p>
<p>about what we should or shouldn&rsquo;t be doing. This is so important to us that we needed to be</p>
<p>constantly watching what we were doing in order to make sure we had a good story to avoid norm</p>
<p>violations. So many norms are about motives. So if I hit you on purpose, that&rsquo;s a big violation.</p>
<p>If I hit you accidentally, that&rsquo;s okay. I need to be able to explain why it was an accident</p>
<p>and not on purpose.</p>
<p>So where does that need come from for your own self preservation?</p>
<p>Right. So humans have norms and we have the norm that if we see anybody violating a norm,</p>
<p>we need to tell other people and then coordinate to make them stop and punish them for violating.</p>
<p>So such benefits are strong enough and severe enough that we each want to avoid being successfully</p>
<p>accused of violating norms. So for example, hitting someone on purpose is a big clear norm</p>
<p>violation. If we do it consistently, we may be thrown out of the group and that would mean we</p>
<p>would die. Okay. So we need to be able to convince people we are not going around hitting people on</p>
<p>purpose. If somebody happens to be at the other end of our fist and their face connects, that was</p>
<p>an accident and we need to be able to explain that. And similarly for many other norms humans</p>
<p>have, we are serious about these norms and we don&rsquo;t want people to violate. We find them</p>
<p>violating, we&rsquo;re going to accuse them. But many norms have a motive component. And so we are</p>
<p>trying to explain ourselves and make sure we have a good motive story about everything we do,</p>
<p>which is why we&rsquo;re constantly trying to explain what we&rsquo;re doing. And that&rsquo;s what your conscious</p>
<p>mind is doing. It is trying to make sure you&rsquo;ve got a good motive story for everything you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. And that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t know why you really do things. What you know is what the good</p>
<p>story is about why you&rsquo;ve been doing things. And that&rsquo;s the self deception. And you&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>there is a machine, the actual dictator is selfish. And then you&rsquo;re just the press secretary who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>desperately doesn&rsquo;t want to get fired and is justifying all of the decisions of the dictator.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the self deception.</p>
<p>Right. Now, most people actually are willing to believe that this is true in the abstract. So</p>
<p>our book has been classified as psychology and it was reviewed by psychologists. And the basic</p>
<p>way that psychology referees and reviewers responded is to say, this is well known. Most</p>
<p>people accept that there&rsquo;s a fair bit of self deception.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t want to accept it about themselves.</p>
<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t want to accept it about the particular topics that we talk about. So people</p>
<p>accept the idea in the abstract that they might be self deceived or that they might not be honest</p>
<p>about various things. But that hasn&rsquo;t penetrated into the literatures where people are explaining</p>
<p>particular things like why we go to school, why we go to the doctor, why we vote, et cetera. So</p>
<p>our book is mainly about 10 areas of life and explaining about in each area what our actual</p>
<p>motives there are. And people who study those things have not admitted that hidden motives are</p>
<p>explaining those particular areas.</p>
<p>So they haven&rsquo;t taken the leap from theoretical psychology to actual public policy.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And economics and all that kind of stuff. Well, let me just linger on this and bring up my old</p>
<p>friends Zingman Freud and Carl Jung. So how vast is this landscape of the unconscious mind,</p>
<p>the power and the scope of the dictator? Is it only dark there? Is it some light? Is there some</p>
<p>love?</p>
<p>The vast majority of what&rsquo;s happening in your head, you&rsquo;re unaware of. So in a literal sense,</p>
<p>the unconscious, the aspects of your mind that you&rsquo;re not conscious of is the overwhelming</p>
<p>majority. But that&rsquo;s just true in a literal engineering sense. Your mind is doing lots of</p>
<p>low level things, and you just can&rsquo;t be consciously aware of all that low level stuff. But there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>plenty of room there for lots of things you&rsquo;re not aware of.</p>
<p>But can we try to shine a light at the things we&rsquo;re unaware of specifically? Now, again,</p>
<p>staying with the philosophical psychology side for a moment, can you shine a light in the Jungian</p>
<p>shadow? What&rsquo;s going on there? What is this machine like? What level of thoughts are happening</p>
<p>there? Is it something that we can even interpret? If we somehow could visualize it, is it something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s human interpretable? Or is it just a kind of chaos of monitoring different systems in the</p>
<p>body, making sure you&rsquo;re happy, making sure you&rsquo;re fed all those kind of basic forces that form</p>
<p>abstractions on top of each other, and they&rsquo;re not introspective at all?</p>
<p>We humans are social creatures. Plausibly being social is the main reason we have these unusually</p>
<p>large brains. Therefore, most of our brain is devoted to being social. And so the things we are</p>
<p>very obsessed with and constantly paying attention to are, how do I look to others? What would others</p>
<p>think of me if they knew these various things they might learn about me?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s close to being fundamental to what it means to be human, is caring what others think.</p>
<p>Right. To be trying to present a story that would be okay for what others think. But we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>constantly thinking, what do other people think?</p>
<p>So let me ask you this question then about you, Robin Hansen, who in many places, sometimes for</p>
<p>fun, sometimes as a basic statement of principle, likes to disagree with what the majority of people</p>
<p>think. So how do you explain, how are you self deceiving yourself in this task? And how are you</p>
<p>being self, like, why is the dictator manipulating you inside your head to be so critical? Like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s norms. Why do you want to stand out in this way? Why do you want to challenge the</p>
<p>norms in this way?</p>
<p>Almost by definition, I can&rsquo;t tell you what I&rsquo;m deceiving myself about. But the more practical</p>
<p>strategy that&rsquo;s quite feasible is to ask about what are typical things that most people deceive</p>
<p>themselves about, and then to own up to those particular things.</p>
<p>Sure. What&rsquo;s a good one?</p>
<p>So for example, I can very much acknowledge that I would like to be well thought of,</p>
<p>that I would be seeking attention and glory and praise from my intellectual work, and that that</p>
<p>would be a major agenda driving my intellectual attempts. So if there were topics that other</p>
<p>people would find less interesting, I might be less interested in those for that reason,</p>
<p>for example. I might want to find topics where other people are interested, and I might want to</p>
<p>go for the glory of finding a big insight rather than a small one, and maybe one that was</p>
<p>especially surprising. That&rsquo;s also, of course, consistent with some more ideal concept of what</p>
<p>an intellectual should be. But most intellectuals are relatively risk averse. They are in some</p>
<p>local intellectual tradition, and they are adding to that, and they are staying conforming to the</p>
<p>sort of usual assumptions and usual accepted beliefs and practices of a particular area</p>
<p>so that they can be accepted in that area and treated as part of the community. But you might</p>
<p>think for the purpose of the larger intellectual project of understanding the world better,</p>
<p>people should be less eager to just add a little bit to some tradition, and they should be looking</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s neglected between the major traditions and major questions. They should be looking for</p>
<p>assumptions maybe we&rsquo;re making that are wrong. They should be looking at things that are very</p>
<p>surprising, things that you would have thought a priori unlikely that once you are convinced of it,</p>
<p>you find that to be very important and a big update. So you could say that one motivation</p>
<p>I might have is less motivated to be sort of comfortably accepted into some particular</p>
<p>intellectual community and more willing to just go for these more fundamental long shots that should</p>
<p>be very important if you could find them.</p>
<p>Which would, if you can find them, would get you appreciated across a larger number of people</p>
<p>across the longer time span of history. So like maybe the small local community will say,</p>
<p>you suck, you must conform. But the larger community will see the brilliance of you</p>
<p>breaking out of the cage of the small conformity into a larger cage. There&rsquo;s always a bigger cage</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll be remembered by more. Yeah. Also that explains your choice of colorful shirt that</p>
<p>looks great in a black background. So you definitely stand out.</p>
<p>Right. Now, of course, you could say, well, you could get all this attention by making false</p>
<p>claims of dramatic improvement. And then wouldn&rsquo;t that be much easier than actually working through</p>
<p>all the details to make true claims?</p>
<p>Why not? Let me ask the press secretary. Why not? So of course you spoke several times about how</p>
<p>much you value truth and the pursuit of truth. That&rsquo;s a very nice narrative. Hitler and Stalin</p>
<p>also talked about the value of truth. Do you worry when you introspect as broadly as all humans</p>
<p>might that it becomes a drug, this being a martyr, being the person who points out that the emperor</p>
<p>wears no clothes, even when the emperor is obviously dressed, just to be the person who points</p>
<p>out that the emperor is wearing no clothes. Do you think about that?</p>
<p>So I think the standards you hold yourself to are dependent on the audience you have in mind.</p>
<p>So if you think of your audience as relatively easily fooled or relatively gullible, then you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t bother to generate more complicated, deep, you know, arguments and structures and evidence</p>
<p>to persuade somebody who has higher standards because why bother? You don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about it. Why bother? You can get away with something much easier. And of course, if you are,</p>
<p>say, a salesperson, you know, you make money on sales, then you don&rsquo;t need to convince the top few</p>
<p>percent of the most sharp customers. You can just go for the bottom 60 percent of the most gullible</p>
<p>customers and make plenty of sales, right? So I think intellectuals have to vary. One of the main</p>
<p>ways intellectuals vary is in who is their audience in their mind? Who are they trying to</p>
<p>impress? Is it the people down the hall? Is it the people who are reading their Twitter feed? Is it</p>
<p>their parents? Is it their high school teacher? Or is it Einstein and Freud and Socrates, right?</p>
<p>So I think those of us who are especially arrogant, especially think that we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>big shot or have a chance at being a really big shot, we were naturally going to pick the</p>
<p>big shot audience that we can. We&rsquo;re going to be trying to impress Socrates and Einstein.</p>
<p>Is that why you hang out with Tyler Cohen a lot and try to convince him yourself?</p>
<p>And you might think, you know, from the point of view of just making money or having sex or</p>
<p>other sorts of things, this is misdirected energy, right? Trying to impress the very</p>
<p>most highest quality minds. That&rsquo;s such a small sample and they can&rsquo;t do that much for you anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I might well have had more, you know, ordinary success in life,</p>
<p>be more popular, invited to more parties, make more money if I had targeted a lower tier</p>
<p>set of intellectuals with the standards they have. But for some reason I decided early on</p>
<p>that Einstein was my audience or people like him and I was going to impress them.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, you pick your set of motivations, you know, convincing,</p>
<p>impressing Tyler Cohen is not going to help you get laid. Trust me, I tried. All right.</p>
<p>What are some notable sort of effects of the elephant in the brain in everyday life? So you</p>
<p>mentioned when we try to apply that to economics, to public policy. So when we think about medicine,</p>
<p>education, all those kinds of things, what are some things that we&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>The key thing is medicine is much less useful health wise than you think. So, you know,</p>
<p>if you were focused on your health, you would care a lot less about it. And if you were focused</p>
<p>on other people&rsquo;s health, you would also care a lot less about it. But if medicine is, as we</p>
<p>suggest, more about showing that you care and let other people showing that they care about you,</p>
<p>then a lot of priority on medicine can make sense. So that was our very earliest discussion</p>
<p>in the podcast. You were talking about what, you know, should you give people a lot of medicine</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not very effective? And then the answer then is, well, if that&rsquo;s the way that you show</p>
<p>that you care about them and you really want them to know you care, then maybe that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you need to do if you can&rsquo;t find a cheaper, more effective substitute. So if we actually just pause</p>
<p>on that for a little bit, how do we start to untangle the full set of self deception happening</p>
<p>in the space of medicine? So we have a method that we use in our book that is what I recommend</p>
<p>for people to use in all these sorts of topics. The straightforward method is first, don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>at yourself. Look at other people, look at broad patterns of behavior and other people, and then</p>
<p>ask, what are the various theories we could have to explain these patterns of behavior? And then</p>
<p>just do the simple matching, which theory better matches the behavior they have. And the last step</p>
<p>is to assume that&rsquo;s true of you too. Don&rsquo;t assume you&rsquo;re an exception. If you happen to be an</p>
<p>exception, that won&rsquo;t go so well, but nevertheless, on average, you aren&rsquo;t very well positioned to</p>
<p>judge if you&rsquo;re an exception. So look at what other people do, explain what other people do,</p>
<p>and assume that&rsquo;s you too. But also in the case of medicine, there&rsquo;s several parties to consider.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the individual person that&rsquo;s receiving the medicine. There&rsquo;s the doctors that are</p>
<p>prescribing the medicine. There&rsquo;s drug companies that are selling drugs. There are governments that</p>
<p>have regulations that are lobbyists. So you can build up a network of categories of humans in this</p>
<p>and they each play their role. So how do you introspect the sort of analyze the system at a</p>
<p>system scale versus at the individual scale? So it turns out that in general, it&rsquo;s usually much</p>
<p>easier to explain producer behavior than consumer behavior. That is, the drug companies or the</p>
<p>doctors have relatively clear incentives to give the customers whatever they want. And so many say</p>
<p>governments in democratic countries have the incentive to give the voters what they want.</p>
<p>So that focuses your attention on the patient and the voter in this equation and saying,</p>
<p>what do they want? They would be driving the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Whatever they want, the other parties are willing to give them in order to get paid. So now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for puzzles in patient and voter behavior. What are they choosing? And why do they choose</p>
<p>that? And how much exactly? And then we can explain that potentially again, returning to</p>
<p>the producer, but the producer being incentivized to manipulate the decision making processes of</p>
<p>the voter and the consumer. Now, in almost every industry, producers are in general happy to lie</p>
<p>and exaggerate in order to get more customers. This is true of auto repair as much as human</p>
<p>body repair and medicine. So the differences between these industries can&rsquo;t be explained</p>
<p>by the willingness of the producers to give customers what they want or to do various things</p>
<p>that we have to again, go to the customers. Why are customers treating body repair different</p>
<p>than auto repair? Yeah, and that potentially requires a lot of thinking, a lot of data</p>
<p>collection and potentially looking at historical data too, because things don&rsquo;t just happen</p>
<p>overnight. Over time, there&rsquo;s trends. In principle it does, but actually it&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>actually easier than you might think. I think the biggest limitation is just the willingness</p>
<p>to consider alternative hypotheses. So many of the patterns that you need to rely on are actually</p>
<p>pretty obvious, simple patterns. You just have to notice them and ask yourself, how can I explain</p>
<p>those? Often you don&rsquo;t need to look at the most subtle, most difficult statistical evidence that</p>
<p>might be out there. The simplest patterns are often enough. All right. So there&rsquo;s a fundamental</p>
<p>statement about self deception in the book. There&rsquo;s the application of that, like we just did</p>
<p>in medicine. Can you steel man the argument that many of the foundational ideas in the book are</p>
<p>wrong? Meaning there&rsquo;s two that you just made, which is it can be a lot simpler than it looks.</p>
<p>Can you steel man the case that it&rsquo;s, case by case, it&rsquo;s always super complicated. Like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a complex system. It&rsquo;s very difficult to have a simple model about. It&rsquo;s very difficult to</p>
<p>introspect. And the other one is that the human brain isn&rsquo;t, not just about self deception. That</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, there&rsquo;s a lot of motivations at play and we are able to really introspect our own</p>
<p>mind. And like what, what&rsquo;s on the surface of the conscious is actually quite a good representation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in the brain. And you&rsquo;re not deceiving yourself. You&rsquo;re able to actually</p>
<p>arrive to deeply think about where your mind stands and what you think about the world. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less about impressing people and more about being a free thinking individual.</p>
<p>So when a child tries to explain why they don&rsquo;t have their homework assignment, they are sometimes</p>
<p>inclined to say, the dog ate my homework. They almost never say the dragon ate my homework.</p>
<p>The reason is the dragon is a completely implausible explanation. Almost always when we</p>
<p>make excuses for things, we choose things that are at least in some degree plausible. It could</p>
<p>perhaps have happened. That&rsquo;s an obstacle for any explanation of a hidden motive or a hidden</p>
<p>feature of human behavior. If people are pretending one thing while really doing another,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually going to pick as a pretense something that&rsquo;s somewhat plausible. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be an obstacle to proving that hypothesis if you are focused on sort of the local data that</p>
<p>a person would typically have if they were challenged. So if you&rsquo;re just looking at one</p>
<p>kid and his lack of homework, maybe you can&rsquo;t tell whether his dog ate his homework or not.</p>
<p>If you happen to know he doesn&rsquo;t have a dog, you might have more confidence. You will need to have</p>
<p>a wider range of evidence than a typical person would when they&rsquo;re encountering that actual excuse</p>
<p>in order to see past the excuse. That will just be a general feature of it. So if I say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this usual story about where we go to the doctor and then there&rsquo;s this other explanation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be true that you&rsquo;ll have to look at wider data in order to see that because people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>usually offer excuses unless in the local context of their excuse, they can get away with it. That</p>
<p>is, it&rsquo;s hard to tell, right? So in the case of medicine, I have to point you to sort of larger</p>
<p>sets of data. But in many areas of academia, including health economics, the researchers there</p>
<p>also want to support the usual points of view. And so they will have selection effects in their</p>
<p>publications and their analysis whereby they, if they&rsquo;re getting a result too much contrary to the</p>
<p>usual point of view everybody wants to have, they will file drawer that paper or redo the analysis</p>
<p>until they get an answer that&rsquo;s more to people&rsquo;s liking. So that means in the health economics</p>
<p>literature, there are plenty of people who will claim that in fact, we have evidence that medicine</p>
<p>is effective. And when I respond, I will have to point you to our most reliable evidence.</p>
<p>And ask you to consider the possibility that the literature is biased in that when the evidence</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t as reliable, when they have more degrees of freedom in order to get the answer they want,</p>
<p>they do tend to get the answer they want. But when we get to the kind of evidence that&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>harder to mess with, that&rsquo;s where we will see the truth be more revealed. So with respect to</p>
<p>medicine, we have millions of papers published in medicine over the years, most of which give the</p>
<p>impression that medicine is useful. There&rsquo;s a small literature on randomized experiments of the</p>
<p>aggregate effects of medicine, where there&rsquo;s maybe a few half dozen or so papers, where it would be</p>
<p>the hardest to hide it because it&rsquo;s such a straightforward experiment done in a straightforward</p>
<p>way that it&rsquo;s hard to manipulate. And that&rsquo;s where I will point you to.</p>
<p>Manipulate. And that&rsquo;s where I will point you to, to show you that there&rsquo;s relatively</p>
<p>little correlation between health and medicine. But even then, people could try to save the</p>
<p>phenomenon and say, well, it&rsquo;s not hidden motives. It&rsquo;s just ignorance. They could say,</p>
<p>for example, you know, medicine&rsquo;s complicated. Most people don&rsquo;t know the literature.</p>
<p>Therefore, they can be excused for ignorance. They are just ignorantly assuming that medicine</p>
<p>is effective. It&rsquo;s not that they have some other motive that they&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>And then I will have to do, you know, as with a conspiracy theory analysis, I&rsquo;m saying, well,</p>
<p>like, how long has this misperception been going on? How consistently has it happened</p>
<p>around the world and across time? And I would have to say, look, you know, if we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>say, a recent new product, like Segway scooters or something, I could say not so many people have</p>
<p>seen them or used them. Maybe they could be confused about their value. If we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a product that&rsquo;s been around for thousands of years, used in roughly the same way all across</p>
<p>the world, and we see the same pattern over and over again, this sort of ignorance mistake just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work so well. It also is a question of how much of the self deception is prevalent versus</p>
<p>foundational. Because there&rsquo;s a kind of implied thing where it&rsquo;s foundational to human nature</p>
<p>versus just a common pitfall. This is a question I have. So, like, maybe human progress is made by</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t fall into the self deception. It&rsquo;s a baser aspect of human nature, but then</p>
<p>you escape it easily if you&rsquo;re motivated.</p>
<p>The motivational hypotheses about the self deceptions are in terms of how it makes you</p>
<p>look to the people around you. Again, the press secretary. So, the story would be, most people</p>
<p>want to look good to the people around them. Therefore, most people present themselves in ways</p>
<p>that help them look good to the people around them. That&rsquo;s sufficient to say there would be a</p>
<p>lot of it. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be 100%, right? There&rsquo;s enough variety in people and in</p>
<p>circumstances that sometimes taking a contrarian strategy can be in the interest of some minority</p>
<p>of the people. So, I might, for example, say that that&rsquo;s a strategy I&rsquo;ve taken. I&rsquo;ve decided that</p>
<p>being contrarian on these things could be winning for me in that there&rsquo;s a room for a small number</p>
<p>of people like me who have these sort of messages who can then get more attention, even if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not room for most people to do that. And that can be explaining sort of the variety, right?</p>
<p>Similarly, you might say, look, just look at the most obvious things. Most people would like to</p>
<p>look good, right? In the sense of physically, just you look good right now. You&rsquo;re wearing a nice</p>
<p>suit, you have a haircut, you shaved, right? So, and we cut my own hair by the way. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s all the more impressive. That&rsquo;s a counter argument for your claim.</p>
<p>So, clearly, if we look at most people and their physical appearance, clearly, most people are</p>
<p>trying to look somewhat nice, right? They shower, they shave, they comb their hair,</p>
<p>but we certainly see some people around who are not trying to look so nice, right? Is that a</p>
<p>big challenge, the hypothesis that people want to look nice? Not that much, right? We can see</p>
<p>in those particular people&rsquo;s context, more particular reasons why they&rsquo;ve chosen to be</p>
<p>an exception to the more general rule.</p>
<p>So, the general rule does reveal something foundational generally.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way things work. Let me ask you, you wrote a blog post about the general rule,</p>
<p>let me ask you, you wrote a blog post about the accuracy of authorities since we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about this, especially in medicine. Just looking around us, especially during this time of the</p>
<p>pandemic, there&rsquo;s been a growing distrust of authorities, of institutions, even the institution</p>
<p>of science itself. What are the pros and cons of authorities, would you say? So, what&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>about authorities? What&rsquo;s nice about institutions? And what are their pitfalls?</p>
<p>One standard function of authority is as something you can defer to, respectively,</p>
<p>without needing to seem too submissive or ignorant or, you know, gullible. That is,</p>
<p>you know, when you&rsquo;re asking what should I act on or what beliefs should I act on,</p>
<p>you might be worried if I chose something too contrarian, too weird, too speculative,</p>
<p>that that would make me look bad. So, I would just choose something very conservative.</p>
<p>So, maybe an authority lets you choose something a little less conservative because the authority</p>
<p>is your authorization. The authority will let you do it. And you can say, and somebody says,</p>
<p>why did you do that thing? And they say, the authority authorized it. The authority tells me,</p>
<p>I should do this. Why aren&rsquo;t you doing it, right?</p>
<p>So, the authority is often pushing for the conservative?</p>
<p>Well, no, the authority can do more. I mean, so for example, we just think about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, in a pandemic even, right? You could just think, I&rsquo;ll just stay home and close</p>
<p>all the doors or I&rsquo;ll just ignore it, right? You could just think of just some very simple</p>
<p>strategy that might be defensible if there were no authorities, right? But authorities might be</p>
<p>able to know more than that. They might be able to like look at some evidence, draw a more context</p>
<p>dependent conclusion, declare it as the authority&rsquo;s opinion. And then other people might follow that</p>
<p>and that could be better than doing nothing. So, what you mentioned, WHO, the world&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>beloved organization. So, this is me speaking in general, WHO and CDC has been kind of,</p>
<p>I, depending on degrees and details, just not behaving as I would have imagined in the best</p>
<p>possible evolution of human civilization, authorities should act. They seem to have failed</p>
<p>in some fundamental way in terms of leadership in a difficult time for our society. Can you say what</p>
<p>are the pros and cons of this particular authority? So, again, if there were no authorities whatsoever,</p>
<p>no accepted authorities, then people would sort of have to sort of randomly pick different local</p>
<p>authorities who would conflict with each other. And then they&rsquo;d be fighting each other about that,</p>
<p>or just not believe anybody and just do some initial default action that you would always do</p>
<p>without responding to context. So, the potential gain of an authority is that they could know more</p>
<p>than just basic ignorance. And if people followed them, they could both be more informed than</p>
<p>ignorance and all doing the same thing. So, they&rsquo;re each protected from being accused or</p>
<p>complained about. That&rsquo;s the idea of an authority. That would be the good. What&rsquo;s the con of that?</p>
<p>Okay. How does that go wrong? So, the con is that if you think of yourself as the authority and</p>
<p>asking what&rsquo;s my best strategy as an authority, it&rsquo;s unfortunately not to be maximally informative.</p>
<p>So, you might think the ideal authority would not just tell you more than ignorance, it would tell</p>
<p>you as much as possible. Okay. It would give you as much detail as you could possibly listen to and</p>
<p>manage to assimilate. And it would update that as frequently as possible or as frequently as you</p>
<p>were able to listen and assimilate. And that would be the maximally informative authority. The problem</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a conflict between being an authority or being seen as an authority and being maximally</p>
<p>informative. That was the point of my blog post that you&rsquo;re pointing out to here. That is, if you</p>
<p>look at it from their point of view, they won&rsquo;t long remain the perceived authority if they are</p>
<p>too cautious, incautious about how they use that authority. And one of the ways to be incautious</p>
<p>would be to be too informative. Okay. That&rsquo;s still in the pro column for me because you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the tensions that are very data driven and very honest. And I would hope that authorities</p>
<p>struggle with that. How much information to provide to people to maximize outcomes.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m generally somebody that believes more information is better because I trust the</p>
<p>intelligence of people. But I&rsquo;d like to mention a bigger con on authorities, which is the human</p>
<p>question. This comes back to a global government and so on. Is that, you know, there&rsquo;s humans that</p>
<p>sit in chairs during meetings and those authorities, they have different titles. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for humans form hierarchies. And sometimes those titles get to your head a little bit</p>
<p>and you start to want to think, how do I preserve my control over this authority? As opposed to</p>
<p>thinking through like, what is the mission of the authority? What is the mission of WHO and</p>
<p>the other such organization? And how do I maximize the implementation of that mission? You start to</p>
<p>think, well, I kind of like sitting in this big chair at the head of the table. I&rsquo;d like to sit</p>
<p>there for another few years or better yet, I want to be remembered as the person who in a time of</p>
<p>crisis was at the head of this authority and did a lot of good things. So you stop trying to do good</p>
<p>under what good means given the mission of the authority. And you start to try to carve a</p>
<p>narrative, to manipulate the narrative. First in the meeting room, everybody around you, just a</p>
<p>small little story you tell yourself, the new interns, the managers throughout the whole</p>
<p>hierarchy of the company. Okay, once everybody in the company or in the organization believes this</p>
<p>narrative, now you start to control the release of information, not because you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>maximize outcomes, but because you&rsquo;re trying to maximize the effectiveness of the narrative that</p>
<p>you are truly a great representative of this authority in human history. And I just feel like</p>
<p>those human forces whenever you have an authority, it starts getting to people&rsquo;s heads. One of the</p>
<p>most, me as a scientist, one of the most disappointing things to see during the pandemic</p>
<p>is the use of authority from colleagues of mine to roll their eyes, to dismiss other human beings</p>
<p>just because they got a PhD, just because they&rsquo;re an assistant, associate, full faculty, just because</p>
<p>they are deputy head of X organization, NIH, whatever the heck the organization is,</p>
<p>just because they got an award of some kind and at a conference they won a best paper award seven</p>
<p>years ago and then somebody shook their hand and gave them a medal, maybe it was a president</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been 20, 30 years that people have been patting them on the back saying how special</p>
<p>they are, especially when they&rsquo;re controlling money and getting sucked up to from other scientists</p>
<p>who really want the money in a self deception kind of way, they don&rsquo;t actually really care</p>
<p>about your performance and all of that gets to your head and no longer are you the authority</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to do good and lessen the suffering in the world, you become an authority that just</p>
<p>wants to maximize, self preserve yourself in a sitting on a throne of power. So this is core to</p>
<p>sort of what it is to be an economist. I&rsquo;m a professor of economics. There you go with the</p>
<p>authority again. No, it&rsquo;s about saying, we often have a situation where we see a world of behavior</p>
<p>and then we see ways in which particular behaviors are not sort of maximally socially useful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And we have a variety of reactions to that. So one kind of reaction is to sort of morally</p>
<p>blame each individual for not doing the maximally socially useful thing under perhaps the idea that</p>
<p>people could be identified and shamed for that and maybe induced into doing the better thing if</p>
<p>only enough people were calling them out on it, right? But another way to think about it is to</p>
<p>think that people sit in institutions with certain stable institutional structures and that</p>
<p>institutions create particular incentives for individuals and that individuals are typically</p>
<p>doing whatever is in their local interest in the context of that institution.</p>
<p>And then perhaps to less blame individuals for winning their local institutional game</p>
<p>and more blaming the world for having the wrong institutions. So economists are often like</p>
<p>wondering what other institutions we could have instead of the ones we have and which of them</p>
<p>might promote better behavior. And this is a common thing we do all across human behavior is</p>
<p>to think of what are the institutions we&rsquo;re in and what are the alternative variations we could</p>
<p>imagine and then to say which institutions would be most productive. I would agree with you that</p>
<p>our information institutions, that is the institutions by which we collect information</p>
<p>and aggregate it and share it with people are especially broken in the sense of far from the</p>
<p>ideal of what would be the most cost effective way to collect and share information. But then</p>
<p>the challenge is to try to produce better institutions. And as an academic, I&rsquo;m aware that</p>
<p>academia is particularly broken in the sense that we give people incentives to do research that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not very interesting or important because basically they&rsquo;re being impressive. And we actually care</p>
<p>more about whether academics are impressive than whether they&rsquo;re interesting or useful.</p>
<p>And I can go happy to go into detail with lots of different known institutions and their known</p>
<p>institutional failings, ways in which those institutions produce incentives that are</p>
<p>mistaken. And that was the point of the post we started with talking about the authorities. If</p>
<p>I need to be seen as an authority, that&rsquo;s at odds with my being informative and I might choose to be</p>
<p>the authority instead of being informative because that&rsquo;s my institutional incentives.</p>
<p>And if I may, I&rsquo;d like to, given that beautiful picture of incentives and individuals that you</p>
<p>just painted, let me just apologize for a couple of things. One, I often put too much blame on</p>
<p>leaders of institutions versus the incentives that govern those institutions. And as a result of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, I believe too critical of Anthony Fauci, too emotional about my criticism of</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci. And I&rsquo;d like to apologize for that because I think there&rsquo;s a deep, there&rsquo;s deeper</p>
<p>truths to think about. There&rsquo;s deeper incentives to think about. That said, I do sort of, I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>romantic creature by nature. I romanticize Winston Churchill. When I think about Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>I think about Hitler more than I do about the individual people of Nazi Germany. You think</p>
<p>about leaders, you think about individuals, not necessarily the parameters, the incentives that</p>
<p>govern the system that, because it&rsquo;s harder. It&rsquo;s harder to think through deeply about the models</p>
<p>from which those individuals arise, but that&rsquo;s the right thing to do. So, but also I don&rsquo;t apologize</p>
<p>for being emotional sometimes and being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to blame the individual leaders in the sense that, you know, I might say, well,</p>
<p>you should be trying to reform these institutions if you&rsquo;re just there to like get promoted and look</p>
<p>good at being at the top. But maybe I can blame you for your motives and your priorities in there,</p>
<p>but I can understand why the people at the top would be the people who are selected for having</p>
<p>the priority of primarily trying to get to the top. I get that.</p>
<p>Can I maybe ask you about particular universities? They&rsquo;ve received, like science has received an</p>
<p>increase in distrust overall as an institution, which breaks my heart because I think science is</p>
<p>beautiful as a, not maybe not as an institution, but as one of the things, one of the journeys that</p>
<p>humans have taken on. The other one is university. I think university is actually a place for me,</p>
<p>at least in the way I see it, is a place of freedom of exploring ideas, scientific ideas,</p>
<p>engineering ideas, more than corporate, more than a company, more than a lot of domains in life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s not just in its ideal, but it&rsquo;s in its implementation, a place where you can</p>
<p>be a kid for your whole life and play with ideas. And I think with all the criticism that universities</p>
<p>still not currently receive, I think they, I don&rsquo;t think that criticism is representative</p>
<p>of universities. They focus on very anecdotal evidence of particular departments, particular</p>
<p>people, but I still feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of place for freedom of thought, at least MIT,</p>
<p>at least in the fields I care about, in a particular kind of science, a particular kind</p>
<p>of technical fields, mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, so robotics,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence. This is a place where you get to be a kid. Yet there is bureaucracy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rising up. There&rsquo;s like more rules. There&rsquo;s more meetings and there&rsquo;s more administration</p>
<p>having like PowerPoint presentations, which to me, you should like be more of a renegade</p>
<p>explorer of ideas and meetings destroy, they suffocate that radical thought that happens</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re an undergraduate student and you can do all kinds of wild things when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a graduate student. Anyway, all that to say, you&rsquo;ve thought about this aspect too. Is there</p>
<p>something positive, insightful you could say about how we can make for better universities</p>
<p>in the decades to come? This particular institution, how can we improve them?</p>
<p>I hear that centuries ago, many scientists and intellectuals were aristocrats. They had time</p>
<p>and could, if they chose, choose to be intellectuals. That&rsquo;s a feature of the combination</p>
<p>that they had some source of resources that allowed them leisure and that the kind of</p>
<p>competition they were faced in among aristocrats allowed that sort of a self indulgence or</p>
<p>self pursuit, at least at some point in their lives. So the analogous observation is that</p>
<p>university professors often have sort of the freedom and space to do a wide range of things.</p>
<p>And I am certainly enjoying that as a tenured professor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a really, sorry to interrupt, a really good representative of that.</p>
<p>Just the exploration you&rsquo;re doing, the depth of thought, like most people are afraid to do the</p>
<p>kind of broad thinking that you&rsquo;re doing, which is great.</p>
<p>The fact that that can happen is a combination of these two things analogously. One is that</p>
<p>we have fierce competition to become a tenured professor, but then once you become tenured,</p>
<p>we give you the freedom to do what you like. And that&rsquo;s a happenstance. It didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>be that way. And in many other walks of life, even though people have a lot of resources,</p>
<p>et cetera, they don&rsquo;t have that kind of freedom set up. So I think we&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of lucky that tenure exists and that I&rsquo;m enjoying it. But I can&rsquo;t be too enthusiastic</p>
<p>about this unless I can approve of sort of the source of the resources that&rsquo;s paying for all</p>
<p>this. So for the aristocrat, if you thought they stole it in war or something, you wouldn&rsquo;t be so</p>
<p>pleased. Whereas if you thought they had earned it or their ancestors had earned this money that</p>
<p>they were spending as an aristocrat, then you could be more okay with that. So for universities,</p>
<p>I have to ask, where are the main sources of resources that are going to the universities and</p>
<p>are they getting their money&rsquo;s worth? Are they getting a good value for that payment?</p>
<p>So first of all, they&rsquo;re students. And the question is, are students getting good value</p>
<p>for their education? And each person is getting value in the sense that they are identified and</p>
<p>shown to be a more capable person, which is then worth more salary as an employee later.</p>
<p>But there is a case for saying there&rsquo;s a big waste to the system because we aren&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>changing the students or educating them. We&rsquo;re more sorting them or labeling them. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very expensive process to produce that outcome. And part of the expense is the freedom from tenure,</p>
<p>I guess. So I feel like I can&rsquo;t be too proud of that because it&rsquo;s basically a tax on all these</p>
<p>young students to pay this enormous amount of money in order to be labeled as better. Whereas I</p>
<p>feel like we should be able to find cheaper ways of doing that. The other main customer is</p>
<p>researcher patrons like the government or other foundations. And then the question is,</p>
<p>are they getting their money worth out of the money they&rsquo;re paying for research to happen?</p>
<p>And my analysis is they don&rsquo;t actually care about the research progress. They are mainly</p>
<p>buying an affiliation with credentialed impressiveness on the part of the researchers.</p>
<p>They mainly pay money to researchers who are impressive and have high, you know,</p>
<p>impressive affiliations. And they don&rsquo;t really much care what research project happens as a result.</p>
<p>Is that a cynical? So there&rsquo;s a deep truth to that cynical perspective. Is there</p>
<p>a less cynical perspective that they do care about the long term investment into the progress</p>
<p>of science and humanity? Well, they might personally care, but they&rsquo;re stuck in an equilibrium.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Wherein they, basically most foundations like governments or research or, you know,</p>
<p>the Ford Foundation, they are, the individuals there are rated based on the prestige they bring</p>
<p>to that organization. And even if they might personally want to produce more intellectual</p>
<p>progress, they are in a competitive game where they don&rsquo;t have tenure and they need to produce</p>
<p>this prestige. And so once they give grant money to prestigious people, that is the thing that</p>
<p>shows that they have achieved prestige for the organization. And that&rsquo;s what they need to do in</p>
<p>order to retain their position. And you do hope that there&rsquo;s a correlation between prestige and</p>
<p>actual competence. Of course, there is a correlation. The question is just, could we do</p>
<p>this better some other way? I think it&rsquo;s almost, I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear we could. What is harder</p>
<p>to do is move the world to a new equilibrium where we do that instead. What are the components</p>
<p>of the better ways to do it? Is it money? So how, the sources of money and how the money is</p>
<p>allocated to give the individual researchers freedom? Years ago I started studying this topic</p>
<p>exactly because this was my issue and this was many decades ago now. And I spent a long time</p>
<p>and my best guess still is prediction markets, betting markets. So if you as a research</p>
<p>paper patron want to know the answer to a particular question, like what&rsquo;s the mass of</p>
<p>the electron neutrino, then what you can do is just subsidize a betting market in that question.</p>
<p>And that will induce more research into answering that question because the people who then</p>
<p>answer that question can then make money in that betting market with the new information they gain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a robust way to induce more information on a topic. If you want to induce an</p>
<p>accomplishment, you can create prizes. And there&rsquo;s of course a long history of prizes to induce</p>
<p>accomplishments. And we moved away from prizes, even though we once used them far more often than</p>
<p>we did today. And there&rsquo;s a history to that. And for the customers who want to be affiliated with</p>
<p>impressive academics, which is what most of the customers want, students, journalists, and patrons,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a better way of doing that, which I just wrote about in my second most recent blog</p>
<p>post. Can you explain? Sure. What we do today is we take sort of acceptance by other academics</p>
<p>recently as our best indication of their deserved prestige. That is recent publications, recent</p>
<p>job affiliation, institutional affiliations, recent invitations to speak, recent grants.</p>
<p>We are today taking other impressive academics, recent choices to affiliate with them as our best</p>
<p>guesstimate of their prestige. I would say we could do better by creating betting markets in what the</p>
<p>distant future will judge to have been their deserved prestige looking back on them. I think</p>
<p>most intellectuals, for example, think that if we looked back two centuries, say to intellectuals</p>
<p>from two centuries ago, and tried to look in detail at their research and how it influenced</p>
<p>future research and which path it was on, we could much more accurately judge their actual</p>
<p>deserved prestige. That is who was actually on the right track, who actually helped, which will be</p>
<p>different than what people at the time judged using the immediate indications at the time of</p>
<p>which position they had or which publications they had or things like that. So in this way,</p>
<p>if you think from the perspective of multiple centuries, you would higher prioritize true</p>
<p>novelty, you would disregard the temporal proximity, like how recent the thing is,</p>
<p>and you would think like, what is the brave, the bold, the big, a novel idea that this sense,</p>
<p>and you would actually, you would be able to rate that because you could see the path</p>
<p>with which ideas took, which things had dead ends, which led to what other followings. You could,</p>
<p>looking back centuries later, have a much better estimate of who actually had what long term</p>
<p>effects on intellectual progress. So my proposal is we actually pay people in several centuries to</p>
<p>do this historical analysis. And we have prediction markets today where we buy and sell</p>
<p>assets, which will later off pay off in terms of those final evaluations. So now we&rsquo;ll be inducing</p>
<p>people today to make their best estimate of those things by actually looking at the details of</p>
<p>people and setting the prices accordingly. So my proposal would be we rate people today on those</p>
<p>prices today. So instead of looking at their list of publications or affiliations, you look at the</p>
<p>actual price of assets that represent people&rsquo;s best guess of what the future will say about them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant. So this concept of idea futures, can you elaborate what this would entail?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been elaborating two versions of it here. So one is if there&rsquo;s a particular question,</p>
<p>say the mass of the electron neutrino, and what you as a patron want to do is get an answer to</p>
<p>that question, then what you would do is subsidize the betting market in that question under the</p>
<p>assumption that eventually we&rsquo;ll just know the answer and we can pay off the bets that way.</p>
<p>And that is a plausible assumption for many kinds of concrete intellectual questions like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mass of the electron neutrino. In this hypothetical world that you&rsquo;re constructing that may be a real</p>
<p>world, do you mean literally financial? Yes. Literal. Very literal. Very cash. Very direct</p>
<p>and literal. Yes. Or crypto. Well, crypto is money. Yes, sure. So the idea would be research labs</p>
<p>would be for profit. They would have as their expense paying researchers to study things and</p>
<p>then their profit would come from using the insights the researchers gains to trade in these</p>
<p>financial markets. Just like hedge funds today make money by paying researchers to study firms</p>
<p>and then making their profits by trading on those that that insight in the ordinary financial market.</p>
<p>And the market would, if it&rsquo;s efficient, would be able to become better and better at predicting</p>
<p>the powerful ideas that the individual is able to generate. The variance around the mass of the</p>
<p>electron neutrino would decrease with time as we learned that value of that parameter better and</p>
<p>any other parameters that we wanted to estimate. You don&rsquo;t think those markets would also respond</p>
<p>to recency of prestige and all those kinds of things? They would respond, but the question is</p>
<p>if they might respond incorrectly, but if you think they&rsquo;re doing it incorrectly, you have a</p>
<p>profit opportunity where you can go fix it. So we&rsquo;d be inviting everybody to ask whether they can</p>
<p>find any biases or errors in the current ways in which people are estimating these things from</p>
<p>whatever clues they have. Right. There&rsquo;s a big incentive for the correction mechanism in academia</p>
<p>currently. There&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s the safe choice to go with the prestige. Exactly. And there&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>Even if you privately think that the prestige is over overrated. Even if you think strongly that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s overrated. Still you don&rsquo;t have an incentive to defy that publicly. You&rsquo;re going to lose a lot</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re a contrarian that writes brilliant blogs and then you could talk about it in the</p>
<p>pocket. Right. I mean, initially this was my initial concept of having these betting markets</p>
<p>on these key parameters. And what I then realized over time was that that&rsquo;s more what people</p>
<p>pretend to care about. What they really mostly care about is just who&rsquo;s how good. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what most of the system is built on is trying to rate people and rank them. And so I designed this</p>
<p>other alternative based on historical evaluation centuries later, just about who&rsquo;s how good,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I think most of the customers really care about.</p>
<p>Customers. I like the word customers here. Humans. Right. Well, every major area of life,</p>
<p>which, you know, has specialists who get paid to do that thing must have some customers from</p>
<p>elsewhere who are paying for it. Well, who are the customers for the mass of the neutrino?</p>
<p>Yes. I, I, I understand that a sense people who are willing to pay. Right. For a thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important thing to understand about anything. Who are the customers? So when I think</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the product, like medicine, education, academia, military, et cetera, that&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>hidden motives analysis. Often people have a thing they say about what the product is and who the</p>
<p>customer is. And maybe you need to dig a little deeper to find out what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>Or a lot deeper. You, uh, you&rsquo;ve written that you seek out quote view quakes. You&rsquo;re able as a,</p>
<p>uh, as an intelligent black box word generating machine, you&rsquo;re able to generate a lot of sexy</p>
<p>words. I like it. I love it. View quakes, which are insights, which dramatically changed my</p>
<p>worldview, your worldview. Uh, you write, I loved science fiction as a child studied physics and</p>
<p>artificial intelligence for a long time each, and now study economics and political science,</p>
<p>all fields full of such insights. So let me ask, what are some view quakes or a beautiful,</p>
<p>surprising idea to you from each of those fields, physics, AI, economics, political science?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a tough question. Something that springs to mind about physics, for example,</p>
<p>that just as beautiful. I mean, right from the beginning, say special relativity was a big</p>
<p>surprise. Uh, you know, most of us have a simple concept of time and it seems perfectly adequate</p>
<p>for everything we&rsquo;ve ever seen. And to have it explained to you that you need to sort of have a</p>
<p>mixture concept of time and space where you put it into the space time construct, how it looks</p>
<p>different from different perspectives. That was quite a shock. And that was, you know, such a</p>
<p>shock that it makes you think, what else do I know that, you know, isn&rsquo;t the way it seems. Certainly</p>
<p>quantum mechanics is certainly another enormous shock in terms of from your point, you know,</p>
<p>you have this idea that there&rsquo;s a space and then there&rsquo;s, you know, point particles at points and</p>
<p>maybe fields in between. And, um, quantum mechanics is just a whole different representation. It looks</p>
<p>nothing like what you would have thought as sort of the basic representation of the physical world.</p>
<p>And that was quite a surprise. What would you say is the catalyst for the, for the view quake in</p>
<p>theoretical physics in the 20th century? Where does that come from? So the interesting thing</p>
<p>about Einstein, it seems like a lot of that came from like almost thought experiments. It wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>almost experimentally driven. Um, and with, actually, I don&rsquo;t know the full story of quantum</p>
<p>mechanics, how much of it is experiment, like where, if you, if you look at the full trace of</p>
<p>idea generation there, uh, of all the weird stuff that falls out of quantum mechanics, how much of</p>
<p>that was the experimentalist? How much was it the theoreticians? But usually in theoretical</p>
<p>physics, the theories lead the way. So maybe can you, uh, can you elucidate like what, what is the</p>
<p>catalyst for these? The remarkable thing about physics and about many other areas of academic</p>
<p>intellectual life is that it just seems way overdetermined. That is, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for</p>
<p>Einstein or if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Heisenberg, certainly within a half a century, somebody else</p>
<p>would have come up with essentially the same things. Is that something you believe or is that</p>
<p>something? Yes. So I think when you look at sort of just the history of physics and the history of</p>
<p>other areas, you know, some areas like that, there&rsquo;s just this enormous convergence that the,</p>
<p>the different kinds of evidence that was being collected was so redundant in the sense that so</p>
<p>many different things revealed the same things that eventually you just kind of have to accept it</p>
<p>because it just gets obvious. So if you look at the details, of course, you know, Einstein did it</p>
<p>for somebody else and it&rsquo;s well worth celebrating Einstein for that. And, you know, we, by</p>
<p>celebrating the particular people who did something first or came across something first,</p>
<p>we are encouraging all the rest to move a little faster, to try to, to push us all a little faster,</p>
<p>which is great. But I still think we would have gotten roughly to the same place within a half</p>
<p>century. So sometimes people are special because of how much longer it would have taken. So some</p>
<p>people say general relativity would have taken longer without Einstein than other things. I mean,</p>
<p>Heisenberg quantum mechanics, I mean, there were several different formulations of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>all around the same few years, means no one of them made that much of a difference. We would have</p>
<p>had pretty much the same thing regardless of which of them did it exactly when. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to celebrate them all. But this is a choice I make in my research. That is, when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an area where there&rsquo;s lots of people working together, you know, who are sort of scoping each</p>
<p>other and getting a result just before somebody else does, you ask, well, how much of a difference</p>
<p>would I make there? At most, I could make something happen a few months before somebody else. And so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less worried about them missing things. So when I&rsquo;m trying to help the world, like doing research,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for neglected things. I&rsquo;m looking for things that nobody&rsquo;s doing it. If I didn&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>nobody would do it. Nobody would do it. Or at least for a long time. In the next 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>kind of thing. Right, exactly. Same with general relativity, just, you know, who would do it?</p>
<p>It might take another 10, 20, 30, 50 years. So that&rsquo;s the place where you can have the</p>
<p>biggest impact is finding the things that nobody would do unless you did them.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when you get the big view quake, the insight. So what about artificial</p>
<p>intelligence? Would it be the EMs, the emulated minds? What idea, whether that struck you in the</p>
<p>shower one day or that you just&hellip;</p>
<p>Clearly, the biggest view quake in artificial intelligence is the realization of just how</p>
<p>complicated our human minds are. So most people who come to artificial intelligence from other</p>
<p>fields or from relative ignorance, a very common phenomenon, which you must be familiar with,</p>
<p>is that they come up with some concept and then they think that must be it. Once we implement this</p>
<p>new concept, we will have it. We will have full human level or higher artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>right? And they&rsquo;re just not appreciating just how big the problem is, how long the road is,</p>
<p>just how much is involved, because that&rsquo;s actually hard to appreciate. When we just think,</p>
<p>it seems really simple. And studying artificial intelligence, going through many particular</p>
<p>problems, looking at each problem, all the different things you need to be able to do</p>
<p>to solve a problem like that, makes you realize all the things your minds are doing that you</p>
<p>are not aware of. That&rsquo;s that vast subconscious that you&rsquo;re not aware of. That&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>view quake from artificial intelligence by far for most people who study artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>is to see just how hard it is. I think that&rsquo;s a good point. But I think it&rsquo;s a very early</p>
<p>view quake. It&rsquo;s when the Dunning Kruger crashes hard. It&rsquo;s the first realization that humans are</p>
<p>actually quite incredible. The human mind, the human body is quite incredible. There&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of different parts to it. But then, see, it&rsquo;s already been so long for me to think about</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s already been so long for me that I&rsquo;ve experienced that view quake that, for me,</p>
<p>I now experience the view quakes of, holy shit, this little thing is actually quite powerful,</p>
<p>like neural networks. I&rsquo;m amazed. Because you&rsquo;ve become almost cynical after that first view quake</p>
<p>of, like, this is so hard. Like, evolution did some incredible work to create the human mind.</p>
<p>But then you realize, just like you have, you&rsquo;ve talked about a bunch of simple models</p>
<p>that simple things can actually be extremely powerful, that maybe emulating the human mind</p>
<p>is extremely difficult. But you can go a long way with a large neural network. You can go a long way</p>
<p>with a dumb solution. It&rsquo;s that Stuart Russell thing with the reinforcement learning. Holy crap,</p>
<p>you can go quite a long way with a simple thing. But we still have a very long road to go,</p>
<p>but not unless&hellip; I can&rsquo;t, I refuse to sort of know. The road is full of surprises. So long is</p>
<p>an interesting, like you said, with the six hard steps that humans have to take to arrive at where</p>
<p>we are from the origin of life on Earth. So it&rsquo;s long, maybe, in the statistical improbability of</p>
<p>the steps that have to be taken. But in terms of how quickly those steps could be taken,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if my intuition says it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s hundreds of years away or if it&rsquo;s a couple of</p>
<p>years away, I prefer to measure&hellip; Pretty confidence, at least a decade. And</p>
<p>mildly confidence, at least three decades. I can steal man either direction. I prefer to</p>
<p>measure that journey in Elon Musk&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s a new&hellip; Well, we don&rsquo;t get Elon Musk very often,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a long timescale. For now, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can clone or maybe multiply or</p>
<p>even know what Elon Musk, what that is. What is that? What is&hellip; That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Exactly. Well, that&rsquo;s an excellent question. How does that fit into the model of the three</p>
<p>parameters that are required for becoming a grabby alien civilization? That&rsquo;s the question of how</p>
<p>much any individual makes in the long path of civilization over time. Yes. And it&rsquo;s a favorite</p>
<p>topic of historians and people to try to focus on individuals and how much of a difference they</p>
<p>make. And certainly, some individuals make a substantial difference in the modest term,</p>
<p>right? Like, you know, without Hitler being Hitler in the role he took, European history would</p>
<p>have taken a different path for a while there. But if we&rsquo;re looking over like many centuries</p>
<p>longer term things, most individuals do fade in their individual influence.</p>
<p>So, I mean&hellip; Even Einstein. Even Einstein, no matter how sexy your hair is, you will also be</p>
<p>forgotten in the long arc of history. So you said at least 10 years. So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about</p>
<p>this AI point of where, how we achieve, how hard is the problem of solving intelligence</p>
<p>is the problem of solving intelligence by engineering artificial intelligence</p>
<p>that achieves human level, human like qualities that we associate with intelligence. How hard</p>
<p>is this? What are the different trajectories that take us there? One way to think about it</p>
<p>is in terms of the scope of the technology space you&rsquo;re talking about. So let&rsquo;s take the biggest</p>
<p>possible scope, all of human technology, right? The entire human economy. So the entire economy</p>
<p>is composed of many industries, each of which have many products with many different technologies</p>
<p>supporting each one. At that scale, I think we can accept that most innovations are a small</p>
<p>fraction of the total. That is usually have relatively gradual overall progress. And that</p>
<p>individual innovations that have a substantial effect that total are rare and their total effect</p>
<p>is still a small percentage of the total economy. There&rsquo;s very few individual innovations that</p>
<p>made a substantial difference to the whole economy. What are we talking? Steam engine,</p>
<p>shipping containers, a few things. Shipping containers deserves to be up there with steam</p>
<p>engines, honestly. Can you say exactly why shipping containers&hellip; Shipping containers</p>
<p>revolutionized shipping. Shipping is very important. But placing that at shipping containers.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you wouldn&rsquo;t have some of the magic of the supply chain, all that,</p>
<p>without shipping containers. That made a big difference, absolutely. Interesting. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to look into. We shouldn&rsquo;t take that tangent, although I&rsquo;m tempted to. But anyway,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a few, just a few innovations. Right. So at the scale of the whole economy, right?</p>
<p>Right. Now, as you move down to a much smaller scale, you will see individual innovations</p>
<p>having a bigger effect, right? So if you look at, I don&rsquo;t know, lawnmowers or something,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the innovations lawnmower, but there were probably like steps where you</p>
<p>just had a new kind of lawnmower and that made a big difference to mowing lawns because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focusing on a smaller part of the whole technology space, right? And sometimes like military</p>
<p>technology, there&rsquo;s a lot of military technologies, a lot of small ones, but every once in a while,</p>
<p>a particular military weapon like makes a big difference. But still, even so, mostly overall,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making modest differences to something that&rsquo;s increasing relatively soon. Like US military</p>
<p>is the strongest in the world consistently for a while. No one weapon in the last 70 years has</p>
<p>made a big difference in terms of the overall prominence of the US military, right? Because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just saying, even though every once in a while, even the recent Soviet hyper missiles or</p>
<p>whatever they are, they aren&rsquo;t changing the overall balance dramatically, right?</p>
<p>So when we get to AI, now I can frame the question, how big is AI? Basically, so one way of</p>
<p>thinking about AI is it&rsquo;s just all mental tasks. And then you ask what fraction of tasks are mental</p>
<p>tasks? And then I go, a lot. And then if I think of AI as like half of everything, then I think,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s got to be composed of lots of parts where any one innovation is only a small impact,</p>
<p>right? Now, if you think, no, no, no, AI is like AGI. And then you think AGI is a small thing,</p>
<p>right? There&rsquo;s only a small number of key innovations that will enable it. Now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking there could be a bigger chunk that you might find that would have a bigger impact. So</p>
<p>the way I would ask you to frame these things in terms of the chunkiness of different areas of</p>
<p>technology, in part, in terms of how big they are. If you take 10 chunky areas and you add them</p>
<p>together, the total is less chunky. Yeah. But don&rsquo;t you, are you able until you solve</p>
<p>the fundamental core parts of the problem to estimate the chunkiness of that problem?</p>
<p>Well, if you have a history of prior chunkiness, that could be your best estimate for future</p>
<p>chunkiness. So for example, I mean, even at the level of the world economy, right? We&rsquo;ve had this,</p>
<p>what, 10,000 years of civilization. Well, that&rsquo;s only a short time. You might say, oh, that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>predict future chunkiness. But it looks relatively steady and consistent. We can say even in computer</p>
<p>science, we&rsquo;ve had 70 years of computer science. We have enough data to look at chunkiness of</p>
<p>computer science. Like when were there algorithms or approaches that made a big chunky difference</p>
<p>and how large a fraction of that was that? And I&rsquo;d say mostly in computer science,</p>
<p>most innovation has been relatively small chunks. The bigger chunks have been rare.</p>
<p>Well, this is the interesting thing. This is about AI and just algorithms in general is</p>
<p>page rank. So Google&rsquo;s, right? So sometimes it&rsquo;s a simple algorithm that by itself is not that useful,</p>
<p>but the scale of context and in a context that&rsquo;s scalable, depending on the context,</p>
<p>all of a sudden the power is revealed. And there&rsquo;s something, I guess that&rsquo;s the nature of chunkiness</p>
<p>is that things that can reach a lot of people simply can be quite chunky.</p>
<p>So one standard story about algorithms is to say algorithms have a fixed cost plus a marginal cost.</p>
<p>And so in history, when you had computers that were very small, you tried all the algorithms</p>
<p>that had low fixed costs and you look for the best of those. But over time, as computers got bigger,</p>
<p>you could afford to do larger fixed costs and try those. And some of those had more effective</p>
<p>algorithms in terms of their marginal cost. And that, in fact, that roughly explains the</p>
<p>longterm history where in fact, the rate of algorithmic improvement is about the same as</p>
<p>the rate of hardware improvement, which is a remarkable coincidence. But it would be explained</p>
<p>by saying, well, there&rsquo;s all these better algorithms you can&rsquo;t try until you have a big enough computer</p>
<p>to pay the fixed cost of doing some trials to find out if that algorithm actually saves you</p>
<p>on the marginal cost. And so that&rsquo;s an explanation for this relatively continuous history. So we have</p>
<p>a good story about why hardware is so continuous. And you might think, why would software be so</p>
<p>continuous with the hardware? But if there&rsquo;s a distribution of algorithms in terms of their fixed</p>
<p>costs, and it&rsquo;s, say, spread out at a wide log normal distribution, then we could be sort of</p>
<p>marching through that log normal distribution, trying out algorithms with larger fixed costs and</p>
<p>finding the ones that have lower marginal costs.</p>
<p>So would you say AGI, human level, AI, even EM, M, emulated minds, is chunky? Like a few</p>
<p>breakthroughs can take us.</p>
<p>So an M is by its nature chunky in the sense that if you have an emulated brain and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>25% effective at emulating it, that&rsquo;s crap. That&rsquo;s nothing. Okay. You pretty much need to</p>
<p>emulate a full human brain.</p>
<p>Is that obvious? Is that obvious?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious. I&rsquo;m talking about like, you know, so the key thing is you&rsquo;re emulating</p>
<p>various brain cells. And so you have to emulate the input output pattern of those cells. So if</p>
<p>you get that pattern somewhat close, but not close enough, then the whole system just doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the overall behavior you&rsquo;re looking for, right?</p>
<p>But it could have functionally some of the power of the overall system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be some threshold. The point is when you get close enough, then it goes over the</p>
<p>threshold, right? It&rsquo;s like taking a computer chip and deleting every 1% of the gates, right?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s very chunky. But the hope is that emulating the human brain, I mean, the human</p>
<p>brain itself is not&hellip;</p>
<p>Right. So it has a certain level of redundancy and a certain level of robustness. And so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some threshold when you get close to that level of redundancy or robustness, then it starts to</p>
<p>work. But until you get to that level, it&rsquo;s just going to be crap, right? It&rsquo;s going to be just a</p>
<p>big thing that isn&rsquo;t working for us. So we can be pretty sure that emulations is a big chunk in an</p>
<p>economic sense, right? At some point, you&rsquo;ll be able to make one that&rsquo;s actually effective in</p>
<p>enable substituting for humans. And then that will be this huge economic product that people will</p>
<p>try to buy like crazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll bring a lot of value to people&rsquo;s lives, so they&rsquo;ll be willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>Right. But it could be that the first emulation costs a billion dollars each, right? And then we</p>
<p>have them, but we can&rsquo;t really use them. They&rsquo;re too expensive. And then the cost slowly comes</p>
<p>down. And now we have less of a chunky adoption, right? That as the cost comes down, then we use</p>
<p>more and more of them in more and more contexts. And that&rsquo;s a more continuous curve. So it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>if the first emulations are relatively cheap that you get a more sudden disruption to society.</p>
<p>And that could happen if sort of the algorithm is the last thing you figure out how to do or</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>What about robots that capture some magic in terms of social connection? The robots, like we have a</p>
<p>robot dog on the carpet right there. Robots that are able to capture some magic of human connection</p>
<p>as they interact with humans, but are not emulating the brain. What about those? How far away?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re thinking about chunkiness or distance now. So if you ask how chunky is the task of making</p>
<p>a, you know, emulatable robot or something, which chunkiness and time are correlated.</p>
<p>Right. But it&rsquo;s about how far away it is or how suddenly it would happen. Chunkiness is how</p>
<p>suddenly and difficulty is just how far away it is. But it could be a continuous difficulty. It</p>
<p>would just be far away, but we&rsquo;ll slowly steadily get there. Or there could be these thresholds where</p>
<p>we reach a threshold and suddenly we can do a lot better.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s a good question for both. I tend to believe that all of it, not just the M, but AGI</p>
<p>too is chunky and human level intelligence embodied in robots is also chunky.</p>
<p>The history of computer science and chunkiness so far seems to be my rough best guess for the</p>
<p>penis of AGI. That is, it is chunky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s modestly chunky, not that chunky. Right.</p>
<p>Our ability to use computers to do many things in the economy has been moving relatively steadily.</p>
<p>Overall, in terms of our use of computers in society,</p>
<p>they have been relatively steadily improving for 70 years.</p>
<p>No, but I would say that&rsquo;s hard. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I would have to really think about that</p>
<p>because neural networks are quite surprising.</p>
<p>Sure. But every once in a while we have a new thing that&rsquo;s surprising. But if you stand back,</p>
<p>you know, we see something like that every 10 years or so, some new innovation that has a big effect.</p>
<p>So, moderately chunky. Yeah.</p>
<p>But the history of the level of disruption we&rsquo;ve seen in the past would be a rough</p>
<p>estimate of the level of disruption in the future. Unless the future is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to hit a chunky territory, much chunkier than we&rsquo;ve seen in the past.</p>
<p>Well, I do think there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like, like Kuhnian, like revolution type.</p>
<p>It seems like the data, especially on AI, is difficult to reason with because it&rsquo;s so recent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a recent field. Wow, AI&rsquo;s been around for 50 years.</p>
<p>I mean, 50, 60, 70, 80 years being recent. Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough time to see a lot of trends.</p>
<p>A few trends, a few trends. I think the internet, computing, there&rsquo;s really a lot of interesting</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s happened over the past 30 years that I think the possibility of revolutions</p>
<p>is likelier than it was in the&hellip; I think for the last 70 years,</p>
<p>there have always been a lot of things that look like they had a potential for revolution.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t reason well about this. I mean, we can reason well by looking</p>
<p>at the past trends. I would say the past trend is roughly your best guess for the future.</p>
<p>No, but if I look back at the things that might&rsquo;ve looked like revolutions in the 70s and 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>they are less like the revolutions that appear to be happening now, or the capacity of revolution</p>
<p>that appear to be there now. First of all, there&rsquo;s a lot more money to be made. So there&rsquo;s a lot more</p>
<p>incentive for markets to do a lot of kind of innovation, it seems like in the AI space.</p>
<p>But then again, there&rsquo;s a history of winters and summers and so on.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;re just like riding a nice wave right now.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues is the difference between impressive demos and commercial value.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So we often through the history of AI, we saw very impressive demos</p>
<p>that never really translated much into commercial value.</p>
<p>Somebody who works on and cares about autonomous and semi autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>tell me about it. And there again, we return to the number of Elon Musk&rsquo;s per earth per year</p>
<p>generated. That&rsquo;s the M. Coincidentally, same initials as the M.</p>
<p>Very suspicious, very suspicious. We&rsquo;re going to have to look into that. All right. Two more fields</p>
<p>that I would like to force and twist your arm to look for view quakes and for beautiful ideas,</p>
<p>economics. What is a beautiful idea to you about economics? You mentioned a lot of them.</p>
<p>Sure. So as you said before, there&rsquo;s going to be the first view cake most people encounter that</p>
<p>makes the biggest difference on average in the world, because that&rsquo;s the only thing most people</p>
<p>ever see is the first one. And so with AI, the first one is just how big the problem is. But</p>
<p>once you get past that, you&rsquo;ll find others. Certainly for economics, the first one is just</p>
<p>the power of markets. You might have thought it was just really hard to figure out how to optimize</p>
<p>in a big, complicated space. And markets just do a good first pass for an awful lot of stuff.</p>
<p>And they are really quite robust and powerful. And that&rsquo;s just quite the view quake, where you just</p>
<p>say, if you want to get in the ballpark, just let a market handle it and step back. And that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>for a wide range of things. It&rsquo;s not true for everything, but it&rsquo;s a very good first approximation.</p>
<p>Most people&rsquo;s intuitions for how they should limit markets are actually messing them up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re that good in sense. Most people, when you go, I don&rsquo;t know if we want to trust that.</p>
<p>Well, you should be trusting that. What are markets? Just a couple of words. So the idea</p>
<p>is if people want something, then let other companies form to try to supply that thing.</p>
<p>Let those people pay for their cost of whatever they&rsquo;re making and try to offer that product</p>
<p>to those people. Let many such firms enter that industry and let the customers decide</p>
<p>which ones they want. And if the firm goes out of business, let it go bankrupt and let other</p>
<p>people invest in whichever ventures they want to try to attract customers to their version</p>
<p>of the product. And that just works for a wide range of products and services.</p>
<p>And through all of this, there&rsquo;s a free exchange of information too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hope that there&rsquo;s no manipulation of information and so on.</p>
<p>Even when those things happen, still just the simple market solution is usually better</p>
<p>than the things you&rsquo;ll try to do to fix it.</p>
<p>Than the alternative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a view, Craig. It&rsquo;s surprising. It&rsquo;s not what you would have initially thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the great, I guess, inventions of human civilization that trust the markets.</p>
<p>Now, another view, Craig, that I learned in my research that&rsquo;s not all of economics,</p>
<p>but something more specialized is the rationality of disagreement. That is,</p>
<p>basically people who are trying to believe what&rsquo;s true in a complicated situation would not actually</p>
<p>disagree. And of course, humans disagree all the time. So it was quite the striking fact for me to</p>
<p>learn in grad school that actually rational agents would not knowingly disagree. And so that makes</p>
<p>disagreement more puzzling and it makes you less willing to disagree.</p>
<p>Humans are, to some degree, rational and are able to&hellip;</p>
<p>Their priorities are different than just figuring out the truth.</p>
<p>Are different than just figuring out the truth.</p>
<p>Which might not be the same as being irrational.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another tangent that could take an hour.</p>
<p>In the space of human affairs, political science, what is a beautiful, foundational,</p>
<p>interesting idea to you, a view, Craig, in the space of political science?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the main thing that goes wrong in politics is people not agreeing on what the best thing to do is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a wrong thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what goes wrong. That is where you say, what&rsquo;s fundamentally behind most</p>
<p>political failures? It&rsquo;s that people are ignorant of what the consequences of policy is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s surprising because it&rsquo;s actually feasible to solve that problem,</p>
<p>which we aren&rsquo;t solving.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bug, not a feature that there&rsquo;s an inability to arrive at a consensus.</p>
<p>So most political systems, if everybody looked to some authority, say, on a question and that</p>
<p>authority told them the answer, then most political systems are capable of just doing that thing.</p>
<p>That is. And so it&rsquo;s the failure to have trustworthy authorities</p>
<p>that is sort of the underlying failure behind most political failure.</p>
<p>We invade Iraq, say, when we don&rsquo;t have an authority to tell us that&rsquo;s a really stupid</p>
<p>thing to do. And it is possible to create more informative trustworthy authorities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a remarkable fact about the world of institutions that we could do that, but we aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s surprising. We could and we aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right. Another big view, Craig, about politics is from the elephant in the brain that most people,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re interacting with politics, they say they want to make the world better,</p>
<p>they make their city better, their country better, and that&rsquo;s not their priority.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>They want to show loyalty to their allies. They want to show their people they&rsquo;re on their side,</p>
<p>yes. Or their various tribes they&rsquo;re in, that&rsquo;s their primary priority and they do accomplish that.</p>
<p>Yeah. And the tribes are usually color coded, conveniently enough.</p>
<p>What would you say, you know, it&rsquo;s the Churchill question. Democracy is the crappiest form of</p>
<p>government, but it&rsquo;s the best one we got. What&rsquo;s the best form of government for this, our 7 billion</p>
<p>human civilization and the maybe as we get farther and further. You mentioned a lot of stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating about human history as we become more forager like and looking out beyond</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best form of government in the next 50, 100 years as we become a multi planetary species.</p>
<p>So, the key failing is that we have existing political institutions and related institutions</p>
<p>like media institutions and other authority institutions, and these institutions sit in</p>
<p>a vast space of possible institutions. And the key failing, we&rsquo;re just not exploring that space.</p>
<p>And the key failing, we&rsquo;re just not exploring that space. So, I have made my proposals in that space,</p>
<p>and I think I can identify many promising solutions. And many other people have made many</p>
<p>other promising proposals in that space. But the key thing is we&rsquo;re just not pursuing those</p>
<p>proposals. We&rsquo;re not trying them out on small scales, we&rsquo;re not doing tests, we&rsquo;re not exploring</p>
<p>the space of these options. That is the key thing we&rsquo;re failing to do. And if we did that, I am</p>
<p>confident we would find much better institutions than one we&rsquo;re using now, but we would have to</p>
<p>actually try. So, a lot of those topics, I do hope we get a chance to talk again. You&rsquo;re a fascinating</p>
<p>human being. So, I&rsquo;m skipping a lot of tangents on purpose that I would love to take. You&rsquo;re such a</p>
<p>brilliant person on so many different topics. Let me take a stroll into the deep human psyche of</p>
<p>Robin Hansen himself. So, first&hellip; May not be that deep.</p>
<p>I might just be all on the surface. What you see is what you get. There might not be much hiding</p>
<p>behind it. Some of the fun is on the surface. I actually think this is true of many of the most</p>
<p>successful, most interesting people you see in the world. That is, they have put so much effort</p>
<p>into the surface that they&rsquo;ve constructed. And that&rsquo;s where they put all their energy. Somebody</p>
<p>might be a statesman or an actor or something else, and people want to interview them and they</p>
<p>want to say, what are you behind the scenes? What do you do in your free time? Those people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have free time. They don&rsquo;t have another life behind the scenes. They put all their energy into</p>
<p>that surface, the one we admire, the one we&rsquo;re fascinated by. And they kind of have to make up</p>
<p>the stuff behind the scenes to supply it for you, but it&rsquo;s not really there. Well, there&rsquo;s several</p>
<p>ways of phrasing that. So, one of it is authenticity, which is if you become the thing you are on the</p>
<p>surface, if the depths mirror the surface, then that&rsquo;s what authenticity is. You&rsquo;re not hiding</p>
<p>something. You&rsquo;re not concealing something. To push back on the idea of actors, they actually have</p>
<p>often a manufactured surface that they put on and they try on different masks and the depths are</p>
<p>very different from the surface. And that&rsquo;s actually what makes them very not interesting</p>
<p>to interview. If you are an actor who actually lives the role that you play, so like, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, Clint Eastwood type character who clearly represents the cowboy, like at least rhymes or</p>
<p>echoes the person you play on the surface, that&rsquo;s authenticity. Some people are typecasts and they</p>
<p>have basically one persona they play in all of their movies and TV shows. And so those people,</p>
<p>it probably is the actual persona that they are, or it has become that over time. Clint Eastwood</p>
<p>would be one. I think of Tom Hanks as an ever. I think they just always play the same person.</p>
<p>And you and I are just both surface players. You&rsquo;re the fun, brilliant thinker and I am the</p>
<p>suit wearing idiot full of silly questions. All right. That said, let&rsquo;s put on your wise</p>
<p>sage hat and ask you, what advice would you give to young people today in high school and college</p>
<p>about life, about how to live a successful life in career or just in general that they can be proud</p>
<p>of? Most young people, when they actually ask you that question, what they usually mean is how can</p>
<p>I be successful by usual standards? I&rsquo;m not very good at giving advice about that because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not how I tried to live my life. So I would more flip it around and say, you live in a rich society</p>
<p>and you will have a long life. You have many resources available to you. Whatever career you</p>
<p>take, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to make progress on something else. Yes, it might be better if you</p>
<p>find a way to combine your career and your interests in a way that gives you more time</p>
<p>and energy, but there are often big compromises there as well. So if you have a passion about some</p>
<p>topic or some thing that you think just is worth pursuing, you can just do it. You don&rsquo;t need other</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s approval. And you can just start doing whatever it is you think it&rsquo;s worth doing. It</p>
<p>might take you decades, but decades are enough to make enormous progress on most all interesting</p>
<p>things. And don&rsquo;t worry about the commitment of it. I mean, that&rsquo;s a lot of what people worry</p>
<p>about is, well, there&rsquo;s so many options. And if I choose a thing and I stick with it, I sacrifice</p>
<p>all the other paths I could have taken. So I switched my career at the age of 34 with two</p>
<p>kids, age zero and two, went back to grad school in social science after being a research software</p>
<p>engineer. So it&rsquo;s quite possible to change your mind later in life.</p>
<p>How can you have an age of zero?</p>
<p>Less than one.</p>
<p>Okay. Oh, you index was zero. I got it. Okay.</p>
<p>Right. People also ask what to read and I say, textbooks. Until you&rsquo;ve read lots of textbooks</p>
<p>or maybe review articles, I&rsquo;m not so sure you should be reading blog posts and Twitter feeds</p>
<p>and even podcasts. I would say at the beginning, this is our best, humanity&rsquo;s best summary of how</p>
<p>to learn things is crammed into textbooks. Especially the ones on like introduction to</p>
<p>biology, introduction to everything. Just read all the algorithms, read as many textbooks as</p>
<p>you can stomach. And then maybe if you want to know more about a subject, find review articles.</p>
<p>Right. You don&rsquo;t need to read the latest stuff for most topics.</p>
<p>Yeah. And actually textbooks often have the prettiest pictures.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>And depending on the field, if it&rsquo;s technical, then doing the homework problems at the end,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually extremely, extremely useful. Extremely powerful way to understand something</p>
<p>if you allow it. I actually think of like high school and college, which you kind of remind me</p>
<p>of, people don&rsquo;t often think of it that way, but you will almost not again get an opportunity</p>
<p>to spend the time with a fundamental subject and like, and everybody&rsquo;s forcing you, like</p>
<p>everybody wants you to do it. And like, you&rsquo;ll never get that chance again to sit there,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s outside of your interest, biology. Like in high school, I took AP biology,</p>
<p>AP chemistry. I&rsquo;m thinking of subjects I never again really visited seriously. And it was so</p>
<p>nice to be forced into anatomy and physiology, to be forced into that world, to stay with it,</p>
<p>to look at the pretty pictures, to certain moments to actually for a moment, enjoy the beauty of</p>
<p>these, of like how a cell works and all those kinds of things. And you&rsquo;re somehow that stays</p>
<p>like the ripples of that fascination that stays with you, even if you never do those,</p>
<p>even if you never utilize those learnings in your actual work.</p>
<p>A common problem, at least of many young people I meet is that they&rsquo;re like feeling</p>
<p>idealistic and altruistic, but in a rush. So, you know, the usual human tradition that goes back,</p>
<p>you know, hundreds of thousands of years is that people&rsquo;s productivity rises with time and maybe</p>
<p>peaks around the age of 40 or 50. The age of 40, 50 is when you will be having the highest income,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have the most contacts, you will sort of be wise about how the world works.</p>
<p>Expect to have your biggest impact then. Before then, you can have impacts, but you&rsquo;re also mainly</p>
<p>building up your resources and abilities. That&rsquo;s the usual human trajectory. Expect that to be</p>
<p>true of you too. Don&rsquo;t be in such a rush to like accomplish enormous things at the age of 18 or</p>
<p>whatever. I mean, you might as well practice trying to do things, but that&rsquo;s mostly about</p>
<p>learning how to do things by practicing. There&rsquo;s a lot of things you can&rsquo;t do unless you just</p>
<p>keep trying them. And when all else fails, try to maximize the number of offspring,</p>
<p>however way you can. That&rsquo;s certainly something I&rsquo;ve neglected. I would tell my younger version</p>
<p>of myself, try to have more descendants. Yes, absolutely. It matters more than I gave,</p>
<p>I realized at the time. Both in terms of making copies of yourself in mutated form</p>
<p>and just the joy of raising them. Sure. I mean, the meaning even, you know, so in the literature on</p>
<p>the value people get out of life, there&rsquo;s a key distinction between happiness and meaning.</p>
<p>So happiness is how do you feel right now about right now and meaning is how do you feel about</p>
<p>your whole life? And, you know, many things that produce happiness don&rsquo;t produce meaning as</p>
<p>reliably. And if you have to choose between them, you&rsquo;d rather have meaning. And meaning is more</p>
<p>goes along with sacrificing happiness sometimes. And children are an example of that. You get a lot</p>
<p>more meaning out of children, even if they&rsquo;re a lot more work. What do you think kids, children</p>
<p>are so magical, like raising kids? I would love to have kids. And whenever I work with robots,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some of the same magic when there&rsquo;s an entity that comes to life. And in that case,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to draw too many parallels, but there is some echo to it, which is when you</p>
<p>program a robot, there&rsquo;s some aspect of your intellect that is now instilled in this other</p>
<p>moving being that&rsquo;s kind of magical. Well, why do you think that&rsquo;s magical? And you said happiness</p>
<p>and meaning as opposed to a short. Why is it meaningful? It&rsquo;s overdetermined. Like I can give</p>
<p>you several different reasons, all of which is sufficient. And so the question is, we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>which ones are the correct reasons. It&rsquo;s overdetermined. Look it up. So, you know, I meet a</p>
<p>lot of people interested in the future, interested in thinking about the future. They&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about how can I influence the future? But overwhelmingly in history so far, the main way</p>
<p>people have influenced the future is by having children, overwhelmingly. And that&rsquo;s just not an</p>
<p>incidental fact. You are built for that. That is, you&rsquo;re the sequence of thousands of generations,</p>
<p>each of which successfully had a descendant. And that affected who you are. You just have to expect</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true that who you are is built to be, you know, expect to have a child, to want to have a</p>
<p>child, to have that be a natural and meaningful interaction for you. And it&rsquo;s just true. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>one of those things you just should have expected and it&rsquo;s not a surprise. Well, to push back and</p>
<p>sort of in terms of influencing the future, as we get more and more technology, more and more of us</p>
<p>are able to influence the future in all kinds of other ways, right? Being a teacher, educator. Even</p>
<p>so, though, still most of our influence in the future has probably happened being kids, even</p>
<p>though we&rsquo;ve accumulated more ways, other ways to do it. You mean at scale. I guess the depth of</p>
<p>influence, like really how much of much effort, how much of yourself you really put into another human</p>
<p>being. Do you mean both the raising of a kid or you mean raw genetic information? Well, both, but</p>
<p>raw genetics is probably more than half of it. More than half. More than half. Even in this modern</p>
<p>world? Yeah. Genetics. Let me ask some dark, difficult questions, if I might. Let&rsquo;s take a</p>
<p>stroll into that place that may or may not exist, according to you. What&rsquo;s the darkest place you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever gone to in your mind, in your life, a dark time, a challenging time in your life that you had to overcome?</p>
<p>You know, probably just feeling strongly rejected. And so I&rsquo;ve been, I&rsquo;m apparently somewhat</p>
<p>emotionally scarred by just being very rejection averse, which must have happened because</p>
<p>some rejections were just very scarring. At a scale in what kinds of communities? On the</p>
<p>individual scale? I mean, lots of different scales, yeah. All the different, many different scales. Still</p>
<p>that rejection stings. Hold on a second, but you are a contrarian thinker. You challenge the</p>
<p>norms. Why, if you were scarred by rejection, why welcome it in so many ways at a much</p>
<p>larger scale, constantly with your ideas? It could be that I&rsquo;m just stupid, or that I&rsquo;ve just categorized</p>
<p>them differently than I should or something. You know, the most rejection that I&rsquo;ve faced hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>because of my intellectual ideas. So the intellectual ideas haven&rsquo;t been the thing</p>
<p>to risk the rejection. The one that, the things that challenge your mind taking you to a dark</p>
<p>place are the more psychological rejections. So. Well, you just asked me, you know, what took me to a</p>
<p>dark place. You didn&rsquo;t specify it as sort of an intellectual dark place, I guess. Yeah, I just</p>
<p>meant like what? So intellectual is disjoint or at least at a more surface level than something</p>
<p>emotional? Yeah, I would just think, you know, there are times in your life when, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just in a dark place and that can have many different causes. And most, you know, most</p>
<p>intellectuals are still just people and most of the things that will affect them are the kinds of</p>
<p>things that affect people. They aren&rsquo;t that different necessarily. I mean, that&rsquo;s going to be true for,</p>
<p>like, I presume most basketball players are still just people. If you ask them what was the worst</p>
<p>part of their life, it&rsquo;s going to be this kind of thing that was the worst part of life for most</p>
<p>people. So rejection early in life? Yeah, I think, I mean, not in grade school probably, but, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, sort of, you know, being a young nerdy guy and feeling, you know, not in much demand or interest</p>
<p>or, you know, later on, lots of different kinds of rejection. But yeah, but I think that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>most of us like to pretend we don&rsquo;t that much need other people. We don&rsquo;t care what they think.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a common sort of stance if somebody rejects you or something, I didn&rsquo;t care about them</p>
<p>anyway. I, you know, didn&rsquo;t, but I think to be honest, people really do care. Yeah, we do seek</p>
<p>that connection, that love. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>Um, opacity, in part. That is, love is one of those things where we know at some level it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to us, but it&rsquo;s not very clearly shown to us exactly how or why or in what ways.</p>
<p>There are some kinds of things we want where we can just clearly see that we want and why that we</p>
<p>want it, right? We know when we&rsquo;re thirsty, and we know why we were thirsty, and we know what to</p>
<p>do about being thirsty, and we know when it&rsquo;s over that we&rsquo;re no longer thirsty. Love isn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what do we seek from this? We&rsquo;re drawn to it, but we do not understand why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re drawn exactly. Because it&rsquo;s not just affection, because if it was just affection,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t seem to be drawn to pure affection. We don&rsquo;t seem to be drawn to somebody who&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>servant. We don&rsquo;t seem to be necessarily drawn to somebody that satisfies all your needs or something</p>
<p>like that. So it&rsquo;s clearly something we want or need, but we&rsquo;re not exactly very clear about it,</p>
<p>and that is kind of important to it. So I&rsquo;ve also noticed there are some kinds of things</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t imagine very well. So if you imagine a situation, there&rsquo;s some aspects of the situation</p>
<p>that you can clearly, you can imagine it being bright or dim, you can imagine it being windy,</p>
<p>or you can imagine it being hot or cold. But there&rsquo;s some aspects about your emotional stance</p>
<p>in a situation that&rsquo;s actually just hard to imagine or even remember. You can often remember</p>
<p>an emotion only when you&rsquo;re in a similar sort of emotion situation, and otherwise, you just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring the emotion to your mind, and you can&rsquo;t even imagine it, right? So there&rsquo;s certain kinds of</p>
<p>emotions you can have, and when you&rsquo;re in that emotion, you can know that you have it, and you</p>
<p>can have a name, and it&rsquo;s associated. But later on, I tell you, remember joy, and it doesn&rsquo;t come to</p>
<p>mind. I&rsquo;m not able to replay it. Right. And it&rsquo;s the sort of reason why we have, one of the reasons</p>
<p>that pushes us to re consume it and reproduce it is that we can&rsquo;t reimagine it. Well, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a Daniel Kahneman type of thing of reliving memories, because I&rsquo;m able to summon</p>
<p>some aspect of that emotion, again, by thinking of that situation from which that emotion came.</p>
<p>Right. So like a certain song, you can listen to it, and you can feel the same way you felt the</p>
<p>first time you remember that song associated with it. Right. So you need to remember that situation</p>
<p>in some sort of complete package. Yes. You can&rsquo;t just take one part off of it, and then if you get</p>
<p>the whole package again, if you remember the whole feeling. Yes. Or some fundamental aspect of that</p>
<p>whole experience that arouse from which the feeling arose. And actually, the feeling is probably</p>
<p>different in some way. It could be more pleasant or less pleasant than the feeling you felt</p>
<p>originally, and that morphs over time every time you replay that memory. It is interesting. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not able to replay the feeling perfectly. You don&rsquo;t remember the feeling. You remember the facts of the</p>
<p>events. So there&rsquo;s a sense of which over time we expand our vocabulary as a community of language,</p>
<p>and that allows us to sort of have more feelings and know that we are feeling them. Because you can</p>
<p>have a feeling but not have a word for it, and then you don&rsquo;t know how to categorize it or even</p>
<p>what it is and whether it&rsquo;s the same as something else. But once you have a word for it, you can</p>
<p>sort of pull it together more easily. And so I think over time we are having a richer palette of</p>
<p>feelings because we have more words for them. What has been a painful loss in your life?</p>
<p>Maybe somebody or something that&rsquo;s no longer in your life, but played an important part of your life.</p>
<p>Youth?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a concept. No, it has to be&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, but I was once younger. I had health and I had vitality. I was</p>
<p>insomere. I mean, you know, I&rsquo;ve lost that over time.</p>
<p>Do you see that as a different person? Maybe you&rsquo;ve lost that person.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. I&rsquo;m a different person than I was when I was younger, and I don&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>exactly what he was. So I don&rsquo;t remember as many things from the past as many people do. So in</p>
<p>some sense, I&rsquo;ve just lost a lot of my history by not remembering it. And I&rsquo;m not that person</p>
<p>anymore. That person is gone and I don&rsquo;t have any of their abilities.</p>
<p>Is it a painful loss, though?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or is it a&hellip; Why is it painful? Because you&rsquo;re wiser.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things that are beneficial to getting older.</p>
<p>Right. But I just was this person and I felt assured that I could continue to be that person.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re no longer that person.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s gone. And I&rsquo;m not him anymore. And he died without fanfare or a funeral.</p>
<p>And that the person you are today talking to me, that person will be changed, too.</p>
<p>Yes. And maybe in 20 years, he won&rsquo;t be there anymore.</p>
<p>And the future person, we&rsquo;ll look back. The future version of you will&hellip;</p>
<p>For Ems, this will be less of a problem. For Ems, they would be able to save an archived</p>
<p>copy of themselves at each different age. And they could turn it on periodically and go back</p>
<p>and talk to it.</p>
<p>To replay. You think some of that will be&hellip; So with emulated minds, with Ems,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a digital cloning that happens. And do you think that makes you less special if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>clonable? Does that make you the experience of life, the experience of a moment, the scarcity</p>
<p>of that moment, the scarcity of that experience, isn&rsquo;t that a fundamental part of what makes</p>
<p>that experience so delicious, so rich of feeling?</p>
<p>I think if you think of a song that lots of people listen to that are copies all over the</p>
<p>world, we&rsquo;re going to call that a more special song.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a perspective on copying and cloning where you&rsquo;re just scaling happiness versus</p>
<p>degrading it.</p>
<p>I mean, each copy of a song is less special if there are many copies, but the song itself is</p>
<p>more special if there are many copies.</p>
<p>In a mass, right, you&rsquo;re actually spreading the happiness even if it diminishes over a</p>
<p>large number of people at scale and that increases the overall happiness in the world.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re able to do that with multiple songs.</p>
<p>Is a person who has an identical twin more or less special?</p>
<p>Well, the problem with identical twins is, you know, it&rsquo;s like just two with M&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Right, but two is different than one.</p>
<p>So I think an identical twin&rsquo;s life is richer for having this other identical twin, somebody</p>
<p>who understands them better than anybody else can.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an identical twin, I think they have a richer life for being</p>
<p>part of this couple, each of which is very similar.</p>
<p>Now, if you said, will the world, you know, if we lose one of the identical twins, will</p>
<p>the world miss it as much because you&rsquo;ve got the other one and they&rsquo;re pretty similar?</p>
<p>Maybe from the rest of the world&rsquo;s point of view, they suffer less of a loss when they</p>
<p>lose one of the identical twins.</p>
<p>But from the point of view of the identical twin themselves, their life is enriched by</p>
<p>having a twin.</p>
<p>See, but the identical twin copying happens at the place of birth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different than copying after you&rsquo;ve done some of the environment, like the nurture</p>
<p>at the teenage or in the 20s after going to college.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;ll be an interesting thing for M&rsquo;s to find out all the different ways that</p>
<p>they can have different relationships to different people who have different degrees of similarity</p>
<p>to them in time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, man.</p>
<p>But it seems like a rich space to explore and I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for them.</p>
<p>This sounds like an interesting world to live in.</p>
<p>And there could be some ethical conundrums there.</p>
<p>There will be many new choices to make that they don&rsquo;t make now.</p>
<p>So, and I discussed that in the book Age of M.</p>
<p>Like, say you have a lover and you make a copy of yourself, but the lover doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>a copy.</p>
<p>Well now, which one of you or are both still related to the lover?</p>
<p>Socially entitled to show up.</p>
<p>Yes, so you&rsquo;ll have to make choices then when you split yourself, which of you inherit</p>
<p>which unique things.</p>
<p>Yeah, and of course there&rsquo;ll be an equivalent increase in lawyers.</p>
<p>Well, I guess you can clone the lawyers to help manage some of these negotiations of</p>
<p>how to split property.</p>
<p>The nature of owning, I mean, property is connected to individuals, right?</p>
<p>You only really need lawyers for this with an inefficient, awkward law that is not very</p>
<p>transparent and able to do things.</p>
<p>So, you know, for example, an operating system of a computer is a law for that computer.</p>
<p>When the operating system is simple and clean, you don&rsquo;t need to hire a lawyer to make a</p>
<p>key choice with the operating system.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a human in the loop.</p>
<p>You just make a choice, right?</p>
<p>So ideally we want a legal system that makes the common choices easy and not require much</p>
<p>overhead.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the digitization of things further enables that.</p>
<p>So the loss of a younger self, what about the loss of your life overall?</p>
<p>Do you ponder your death, your mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>I am a cryonics customer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this little tag around my deck says.</p>
<p>It says that if you find me in a medical situation, you should call these people to enable the</p>
<p>cryonics transfer.</p>
<p>So I am taking a long shot chance at living a much longer life.</p>
<p>Can you explain what cryonics is?</p>
<p>So when medical science gives up on me in this world, instead of burning me or letting</p>
<p>worms eat me, they will freeze me or at least freeze my head.</p>
<p>And there is damage that happens in the process of freezing the head.</p>
<p>But once it&rsquo;s frozen, it won&rsquo;t change for a very long time.</p>
<p>Chemically, it&rsquo;ll just be completely exactly the same.</p>
<p>So future technology might be able to revive me.</p>
<p>And in fact, I would be mainly counting on the brain emulation scenario, which doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>require reviving my entire biological body.</p>
<p>It means I would be in a computer simulation.</p>
<p>And so I think I&rsquo;ve got at least a 5% shot at that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s immortality.</p>
<p>But most likely it won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And therefore, I&rsquo;m sad that it won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Do you think immortality is something that you would like to have?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, just like infinity, I mean, you can&rsquo;t know until forever, which means</p>
<p>never, right?</p>
<p>So all you can really, you know, the better choice is at each moment, do you want to keep</p>
<p>going?</p>
<p>So I would like at every moment to have the option to keep going.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about human experience is that the way you phrase it is exactly right.</p>
<p>At every moment, I would like to keep going.</p>
<p>But the thing that happens, you know, leave them wanting more of whatever that phrase</p>
<p>is, the thing that happens is over time, it&rsquo;s possible for certain experiences to become</p>
<p>bland and you become tired of them.</p>
<p>And that actually makes life really unpleasant.</p>
<p>Sorry, makes that experience really unpleasant.</p>
<p>And perhaps you can generalize that to life itself if you have a long enough horizon.</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>Might happen, but might as well wait and find out.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re ending on suffering, you know?</p>
<p>So in the world of brain emulations, I have more options.</p>
<p>You can return yourself.</p>
<p>That is, I can make copies of myself, archive copies at various ages.</p>
<p>And at a later age, I could decide that I&rsquo;d rather replace myself with a new copy from</p>
<p>a younger age.</p>
<p>So does a brain emulation still operate in physical space?</p>
<p>So can we do, what do you think about like the metaverse and operating in virtual reality</p>
<p>so we can conjure up not just emulate, not just your own brain and body, but the entirety</p>
<p>of the environment?</p>
<p>Well, most brain emulations will, in fact, most of their time in virtual reality.</p>
<p>But they wouldn&rsquo;t think of it as virtual reality.</p>
<p>They would just think of it as their usual reality.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing to notice, I think, in our world, most of us spend most time indoors.</p>
<p>And indoors, we are surrounded by walls covered with paint and floors covered with</p>
<p>tile or rugs.</p>
<p>Most of our environment is artificial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constructed to be convenient for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the natural world that was there before.</p>
<p>A virtual reality is basically just like that.</p>
<p>It is the environment that&rsquo;s comfortable and convenient for you.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s the right, that environment for you, it&rsquo;s real for you.</p>
<p>Just like the room you&rsquo;re in right now most likely is very real for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not focused on the fact that the paint is hiding the actual studs behind the</p>
<p>wall and the actual wires and pipes and everything else.</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;re hiding that from you doesn&rsquo;t make it fake or unreal.</p>
<p>What are the chances that we&rsquo;re actually in the very kind of system that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>where the environment and the brain is being emulated and you&rsquo;re just replaying an experience</p>
<p>when you first did a podcast with Lex after?</p>
<p>And now, the person that originally launched this already did hundreds of podcasts with</p>
<p>Lex.</p>
<p>This is just the first time and you like this time because there&rsquo;s so much uncertainty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nerves.</p>
<p>It could have gone any direction.</p>
<p>At the moment, we don&rsquo;t have the technical ability to create that emulation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d have to be postulating that in the future we have that ability and then they</p>
<p>choose to evaluate this moment now to simulate it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think we could be in the simulation of that exact experience right now and we</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able to know?</p>
<p>So one scenario would be this never really happened.</p>
<p>This only happens as a reconstruction later on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different than the scenario that this did happen the first time and now it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>again as a reconstruction.</p>
<p>That second scenario is harder to put together because it requires this coincidence where</p>
<p>between the two times we produce the ability to do it.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think replay of memories, poor replay of memories is something that might</p>
<p>be a possible thing in the future?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s harder than conjure up things from scratch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible.</p>
<p>So the main way I would think about it is in terms of the demand for simulation versus</p>
<p>other kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve given this a lot of thought because I first wrote about this long ago when Bostrom</p>
<p>first wrote his papers about simulation argument and I wrote about how to live in a simulation.</p>
<p>And so the key issue is the fraction of creatures in the universe that are really experiencing</p>
<p>what you appear to be really experiencing relative to the fraction that are experiencing</p>
<p>it in a simulation way, i.e., simulated.</p>
<p>So then the key parameter is at any one moment in time, creatures at that time, many of them,</p>
<p>most of them are presumably really experiencing what they&rsquo;re experiencing, but some fraction</p>
<p>of them are experiencing some past time where that past time is being remembered via their</p>
<p>simulation.</p>
<p>So to figure out this ratio, what we need to think about is basically two functions.</p>
<p>One is how fast in time does the number of creatures grow?</p>
<p>And then how fast in time does the interest in the past decline?</p>
<p>Because at any one time, people will be simulating different periods in the past with different</p>
<p>emphasis.</p>
<p>I love the way you think so much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right, yeah.</p>
<p>So if the first function grows slower than the second one declines, then in fact, your</p>
<p>chances of being simulated are low.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the key question is how fast does interest in the past decline relative to the rate</p>
<p>at which the population grows with time?</p>
<p>Does this correlate to you earlier suggested that the interest in the future increases</p>
<p>over time, are those correlated interest in the future versus interest in the past?</p>
<p>Like, why are we interested in the past?</p>
<p>So, but the simple way to do it is, as you know, like Google Ngrams has a way to type</p>
<p>in a word and see how interest in it declines or rises over time, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can just type in a year and get the answer for that.</p>
<p>If you type in a particular year, like 1900 or 1950, you can see with Google Ngram, how</p>
<p>interest in that year increased up until that date and decreased after it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And you can see that interest in a date declines faster than does the population grow with</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>That is brilliant.</p>
<p>That is so interesting.</p>
<p>And so you have the answer.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And that was your argument against, not against to this particular aspect of the simulation,</p>
<p>how much past simulation there will be, replay of past memories.</p>
<p>First of all, if we assume that like simulation of the past is a small fraction of all the</p>
<p>creatures at that moment.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s about how fast.</p>
<p>Now, some people have argued plausibly that maybe most interest in the past falls with</p>
<p>this fast function, but some unusual category of interest in the past won&rsquo;t fall that fast</p>
<p>quickly.</p>
<p>And then that eventually would dominate.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a other hypothesis you want.</p>
<p>Some category.</p>
<p>So that very outlier specific kind of, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like really popular kinds of memories, like probably sexual.</p>
<p>In a trillion years, there&rsquo;s some small research institute that tries to randomly select from</p>
<p>all possible people in history or something to simulate.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So the question is how big is this research institute and how big is the future in a trillion</p>
<p>years, right?</p>
<p>And that would be hard to say.</p>
<p>But if we just look at the ordinary process by which people simulate recent errors.</p>
<p>So if you look at, it&rsquo;s also true for movies and plays and video games,</p>
<p>overwhelmingly they&rsquo;re interested in the recent past.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few video games where you play someone in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But even fewer where you play someone in the ancient Egyptian Empire.</p>
<p>Yeah, just different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just declined very quickly.</p>
<p>But every once in a while that&rsquo;s brought back.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, just if you look at the mass of entertainment, movies and games, it&rsquo;s focusing on the present</p>
<p>recent past.</p>
<p>And maybe some, I mean, where does science fiction fit into this?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s sort of, what is science fiction?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a mix of the past and the present and some kind of manipulation of that to make</p>
<p>it more efficient for us to ask deep philosophical questions about humanity.</p>
<p>The closest genre to science fiction is clearly fantasy.</p>
<p>Fantasy and science fiction in many bookstores and even Netflix or whatever categories, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just lumped together.</p>
<p>So clearly they have a similar function.</p>
<p>So that the function of fantasy is more transparent than the function of science fiction.</p>
<p>So use that as your guide.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s fantasy for is just to take away the constraints of the ordinary world and imagine</p>
<p>stories with much fewer constraints.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what fantasy is.</p>
<p>You are much less constrained.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose to remove constraints?</p>
<p>Is it to escape from the harshness of the constraints of the real world?</p>
<p>Or is it to just remove constraints in order to explore some, get a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of our world?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>I mean, why do people read fantasy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a cheap fantasy reading kind of person.</p>
<p>So I need to&hellip;</p>
<p>One story that sounds plausible to me is that there are sort of these deep story structures</p>
<p>that we love and we want to realize.</p>
<p>And then many details of the world get in their way.</p>
<p>Fantasy takes all those obstacles out of the way and lets you tell the essential hero story</p>
<p>or the essential love story, whatever essential story you want to tell.</p>
<p>Well, the reality and constraints are not in the way.</p>
<p>And so science fiction can be thought of as like fantasy, except you&rsquo;re not willing to</p>
<p>admit that it can&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>So the future gives the excuse of saying, well, it could happen.</p>
<p>And you accept some more reality constraints for the illusion, at least, that maybe it</p>
<p>could really happen.</p>
<p>Maybe it could happen.</p>
<p>And that, it stimulates the imagination.</p>
<p>Imagination is something really interesting about human beings.</p>
<p>And it seems also to be an important part of creating really special things is to be</p>
<p>able to first imagine them.</p>
<p>With you and Nick Bostrom, where do you land on the simulation and all the mathematical</p>
<p>ways of thinking it and just the thought experiment of it?</p>
<p>Are we living in a simulation?</p>
<p>That was just the discussion we just had.</p>
<p>That is, you should grant the possibility of being a simulation.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be 100% confident that you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You should certainly grant a small probability.</p>
<p>The question is, how large is that probability?</p>
<p>Are you saying we would be, I misunderstood because I thought our discussion was about</p>
<p>replaying things that already happened.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But the whole question is, right now, is that what I am?</p>
<p>Am I actually a replay from some distant future?</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be a replay.</p>
<p>It could be a totally new.</p>
<p>You could be, you don&rsquo;t have to be an NPC.</p>
<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m in a certain era with a certain kind of world around me.</p>
<p>So either this is a complete fantasy or it&rsquo;s a past of somebody else in the future.</p>
<p>No, it could be a complete fantasy though.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>But then you have to talk about what&rsquo;s the fraction of complete fantasies.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s easier to generate a fantasy than to replay a memory.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Oh, but the fraction is important.</p>
<p>We just look at the entire history of everything.</p>
<p>We just say, sure, but most things are real.</p>
<p>Most things aren&rsquo;t fantasies.</p>
<p>Therefore, the chance that my thing is real.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So the simulation argument works stronger about sort of the past.</p>
<p>We say, ah, but there&rsquo;s more future people than there are today.</p>
<p>So you being in the past of the future makes you special relative to them,</p>
<p>which makes you more likely to be in a simulation.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re just taking the full count and saying, in all creatures ever,</p>
<p>what percentage are in simulations?</p>
<p>Probably no more than 10%.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the good argument for that?</p>
<p>That most things are real?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because a classroom says the other way, right?</p>
<p>In a competitive world, in a world where people have to work and have to get things done,</p>
<p>then they have a limited budget for leisure.</p>
<p>And so, you know, leisure things are less common than work things, like real things.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But if you look at the stretch of history in the universe, doesn&rsquo;t the ratio of leisure increase?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that where we, isn&rsquo;t that the forger?</p>
<p>Right, but now we&rsquo;re looking at the fraction of leisure,</p>
<p>which takes the form of something where the person doing the leisure doesn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>Now there could be some fraction of that, but that&rsquo;s much smaller, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Clueless forgers.</p>
<p>Or somebody is clueless in the process of supporting this leisure, right?</p>
<p>It might not be the person leisureing, somebody,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a supporting character or something,</p>
<p>but still that&rsquo;s got to be a pretty small fraction of leisure.</p>
<p>What, you mentioned that children are one of the things that are a source of meaning.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, then let me ask the big question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>Robin, meaning of life.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>We talked about alien civilizations, but this is the one we got.</p>
<p>Where are the aliens?</p>
<p>Where are the human?</p>
<p>Seem to be conscious, be able to introspect.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, why are we here?</p>
<p>This is the thing I told you before about how we can predict that</p>
<p>future creatures will be different from us.</p>
<p>We, our preferences are this amalgam of various sorts of random sort of patched together</p>
<p>preferences about thirst and sex and sleep and attention and all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t understand that very well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very transparent and it&rsquo;s a mess, right?</p>
<p>That is the source of our motivation.</p>
<p>That is how we were made and how we are induced to do things.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t summarize it very well and we don&rsquo;t even understand it very well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who we are.</p>
<p>And often we find ourselves in a situation where we don&rsquo;t feel very motivated.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>In other situations, we find ourselves very motivated and we don&rsquo;t know why either.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the nature of being a human of the sort that we are because</p>
<p>even though we can think abstractly and reason abstractly, this package</p>
<p>of motivations is just opaque and a mess.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it means to be a human today and the motivation.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t very well tell the meaning of our life.</p>
<p>It is this mess that our descendants will be different.</p>
<p>They will actually know exactly what they want.</p>
<p>And it will be to have more descendants.</p>
<p>That will be the meaning for them.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny that you have the certainty.</p>
<p>You have more certainty.</p>
<p>You have more transparency about our descendants than you do about your own self.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really interesting to think, because you mentioned this about love,</p>
<p>that something that&rsquo;s fundamental about love is this opaqueness that we&rsquo;re not able</p>
<p>to really introspect what the heck it is or all the feelings, the complex feelings.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true about many of our motivations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it means to be human of the 20th and the 21st century variety.</p>
<p>Why is that not a feature that we will choose to persist in civilization then?</p>
<p>This opaqueness, put another way, mystery, maintaining a sense of mystery</p>
<p>about ourselves and about those around us.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a really nice thing to have.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>But, so, I mean, this is the fundamental issue in analyzing the future.</p>
<p>What will set the future?</p>
<p>One theory about what will set the future is, what do we want the future to be?</p>
<p>What do we want the future to be?</p>
<p>So under that theory, we should sit and talk about what we want the future to be,</p>
<p>have some conferences, have some conventions, discussion things, vote on it maybe,</p>
<p>and then hand out off to the implementation people to make the future the way we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>decided it should be.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the actual process that&rsquo;s changed the world over history up to this point.</p>
<p>It has not been the result of us deciding what we want and making it happen.</p>
<p>In our individual lives, we can do that.</p>
<p>We might decide what career we want or where we want to live, who we want to live with.</p>
<p>In our individual lives, we often do slowly make our lives better according to our plan</p>
<p>and our things, but that&rsquo;s not the whole world.</p>
<p>The whole world so far has mostly been a competitive world where things happen if</p>
<p>anybody anywhere chooses to adopt them and they have an advantage.</p>
<p>And then it spreads and other people are forced to adopt it by competitive pressures.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of analysis I can use to predict the future.</p>
<p>And I do use that to predict the future.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell us it&rsquo;ll be a future we like.</p>
<p>It just tells us what it&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be one where we&rsquo;re trying to maximize the number of our descendants.</p>
<p>And we know that abstractly and directly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not opaque.</p>
<p>With some probability that&rsquo;s nonzero, that will lead us to become grabby in expanding</p>
<p>aggressively out into the cosmos until we meet other aliens.</p>
<p>The timing isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>We might become grabby and then this happens.</p>
<p>These are, the grabbiness and this are both the result of competition, but it&rsquo;s less</p>
<p>clear which happens first.</p>
<p>Does this future excite you or scare you?</p>
<p>How do you feel about this whole thing?</p>
<p>Again, I told you compared to sort of a dead cosmology, at least it&rsquo;s energizing and having</p>
<p>a living story with real actors and characters and agendas, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one hell of a fun universe to live in.</p>
<p>Robin, you&rsquo;re one of the most fascinating, fun people to talk to.</p>
<p>Brilliant, humble, systematic in your analysis.</p>
<p>Hold on to my wallet here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he looking for?</p>
<p>I already stole your wallet long ago.</p>
<p>I really, really appreciate you spending your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>I hope we get a chance to talk many more times in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for sitting down.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Robin Hansen.</p>
