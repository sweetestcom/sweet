    <p>Yeah, Chamath goes to those sorts of events and they all pick some endangered animal and</p>
<p>then they skin it and they make a sweater out of it for him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that Illuminati sh**, Illuminati.</p>
<p>So this is Kashmir, it&rsquo;s Loro Piana.</p>
<p>The lining is chinchilla.</p>
<p>Oh, chinchilla.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>Geez.</p>
<p>I knew it was some poor animal.</p>
<p>I mean, it is so phenomenal.</p>
<p>Some poor animal.</p>
<p>Probably nicer than a dog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so warm.</p>
<p>Probably sweeter than any dog you&rsquo;ve ever met if you actually played with a chinchilla.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so warm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, oh, I&rsquo;m just rubbing it.</p>
<p>PETA is boycotting the show right now.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Saks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>We open-sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Queen of Kinwam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of the All In Illuminati podcast.</p>
<p>We took Thanksgiving off, but the Illuminati is back to tell you what&rsquo;s going on in the</p>
<p>Star Chamber.</p>
<p>David Freeburg, the Sultan of Science, Queen of Kinwam, back with us.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Sultan of Science.</p>
<p>Looking svelte, David Saks at his fighting weight, 168 to 172 pounds in the red corner</p>
<p>and with a cashmere chinchilla sweater.</p>
<p>Chinchilla.</p>
<p>The Urkel from Sri Lanka at 142 pounds, Chabath Palihapatiya.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m of course, J.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at my, I&rsquo;m at my, not peak weight, but in my 20s and 30s, I was like 172 pounds.</p>
<p>Well you&rsquo;re six foot, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Six two.</p>
<p>So I mean, I&rsquo;m currently 166.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And you, and you, and you are wearing a shirt.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>If I was 166, I would-</p>
<p>I did my, I did my body scan.</p>
<p>I was-</p>
<p>Percentage body fat is what?</p>
<p>15%?</p>
<p>11.1%.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going into elite athlete slash castaway territory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there for a while.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Saks-</p>
<p>Lean body mass was 152.8 pounds.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>My basal metabolic rate was 1,868 calories.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, this was with my jeans on, sorry.</p>
<p>And this was midday.</p>
<p>So I had breakfast.</p>
<p>So it was 171.9.</p>
<p>So 172.</p>
<p>So minus the clothes in the morning, I think I&rsquo;m 167, less eating.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Body, yeah.</p>
<p>11.1% body fat.</p>
<p>My BMI was 22.7.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So we took Thanksgiving off, but we&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s been a bit of a crazy run.</p>
<p>Saks and I are in Miami for Web 3.0.</p>
<p>We would be delighted to know that there is no COVID in Florida.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve solved the COVID problem.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>I missed you guys.</p>
<p>I missed you guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to take a week off.</p>
<p>That was a mistake.</p>
<p>We should have done a Thanksgiving episode.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lame to take a week off because I miss everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Did everyone have a good Thanksgiving?</p>
<p>I took my kids to Vegas.</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>The older three.</p>
<p>Me and Nat&rsquo;s dad, we took the older three to Vegas.</p>
<p>We took them to like Blue Man Group, to the Lions.</p>
<p>You saw a good show.</p>
<p>Lions Safari.</p>
<p>Blue Man is a little loud, actually, to be honest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really appropriate for kids to &hellip; Hey, I almost had a seizure, so</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you teach your kids how to play craps?</p>
<p>I like that Beetle Cirque de Soleil show.</p>
<p>Beetle&rsquo;s Love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That would have been a better choice in the end.</p>
<p>Love that one.</p>
<p>What else did we do?</p>
<p>We took them to the Adventure Dome, which is like an indoor amusement park.</p>
<p>What did you eat?</p>
<p>Any good food?</p>
<p>We ate a Cipriani one night and Carbone the next night.</p>
<p>I was about to say, man.</p>
<p>Those two places.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Fabulous.</p>
<p>We had vodka sauce.</p>
<p>Fabulous.</p>
<p>I was talking to Jade about the Carbone rigatoni with vodka sauce, and she started making it</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>Delicious.</p>
<p>She had the recipe online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so funny you mentioned it, but both me and Popsie got it, and we were both like,</p>
<p>this is fricking awesome.</p>
<p>Spicy rigatoni.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so delicious.</p>
<p>I mean, you can make it at home, and it&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>What was your &hellip; You came to Miami for Thanksgiving, I take it?</p>
<p>Oh, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I won 100 dimes.</p>
<p>Played craps for a little bit.</p>
<p>Bop, bop.</p>
<p>Beep, beep.</p>
<p>Bink.</p>
<p>Okay, so that plays for half the trip.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you play?</p>
<p>You played Encore?</p>
<p>I stayed at the Encore.</p>
<p>I spiked the wind for 100 dimes for two hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice little thing.</p>
<p>Right at the bottom of the towers at that little VIP area down there?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>
<p>I mean, look, when you go to a casino, the best thing is you put the dice in the hands</p>
<p>of the person that&rsquo;s never rolled.</p>
<p>I said to Sergio, I said, Bopsy, just go there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to start rolling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ignoring you, so please don&rsquo;t misinterpret this, but I&rsquo;m just going to let you be in</p>
<p>your little zone.</p>
<p>He hit everything.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>For 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And you got up.</p>
<p>You left a winner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always about &hellip; It&rsquo;s all about when you get up.</p>
<p>Speaking about when you get up, I have been with Saks.</p>
<p>You want to talk about Rain Man?</p>
<p>Literally when David Saks &hellip; Oh, my God, Saks.</p>
<p>Saks went off one night.</p>
<p>Do you remember that night he went off?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I was about to bring it up, but here&rsquo;s the thing with Saks.</p>
<p>How much did he win?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>How much did you win?</p>
<p>I saw a ballpark.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not correct.</p>
<p>Beep it out.</p>
<p>I will say.</p>
<p>How much was that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Beep it out, man.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Beep it out.</p>
<p>What was the number?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, let me just tell you.</p>
<p>When Saks and I go to Vegas and he plays blackjack, it&rsquo;s literally like the two of us coming down</p>
<p>the escalator, like Tom Cruise and Rain Man.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re wearing the same suit.</p>
<p>We go in there.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Tom Cruise?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Tom Cruise, and he&rsquo;s the Rain Man.</p>
<p>Literally, he&rsquo;s got his head tilted.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, blackjack.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to play three hands of concurrent blackjack with J-Cal.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re counting cards at the Aria, at the high roller, and so we start high rolling,</p>
<p>and I swear to God, this guy goes down a model X, goes up a plat, but he never gives up.</p>
<p>He never gives up, and we&rsquo;re supposed to go to LA.</p>
<p>I have a benefit dinner I bought a table for, and he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m sorry, J-Cal.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t leave, so I show up for the benefit dinner three hours late.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re closing the place down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, thanks for showing up, J-Cal, and it was all because he had to come back</p>
<p>up, but I&rsquo;ve seen him come back from some gnarly defeats.</p>
<p>What is the secret, Saks?</p>
<p>Well, I saw Phil, your friend Phil Hellmuth and Brandon Cantu the other night here in</p>
<p>New York City, and they reminded me of that legendary run where basically, I think I bought</p>
<p>in for 100, and I was playing two hands, and I was down to my last five, and I&rsquo;d been on</p>
<p>a horrible losing streak.</p>
<p>The hand came along where the dealer had a five showing, and basically, I doubled down</p>
<p>for my last bets, and then the dealer misdealed.</p>
<p>We did the cards out of order, and Phil made her rewind the cards and have them go back</p>
<p>to where they were supposed to go instead of declaring the hand a misdeal because I</p>
<p>had doubled down with the five showing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the pit boss came over.</p>
<p>They ended up listening to Phil, and I won those two hands, and then from there, I went</p>
<p>on a run.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Cantu actually remembers the stats.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you won 85% of the hands in the next two shoes.</p>
<p>Shoes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You won like 35 hands in a row.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was crazy.</p>
<p>Did you tip Phil at the end of the night?</p>
<p>He was there playing with me.</p>
<p>It was him, me, and then Cantu was there as like kind of the real bird, and it was bonkers.</p>
<p>These pro poker players, they are kind of savants for these kinds of things.</p>
<p>They remember every hand.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>They could go back years.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Phil talks about some random hand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Every flop, turn, river.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gambling TiVos.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gambling TiVos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a DVR in their brains.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When we were playing, it was basically Phil was there, and then I was playing two hands,</p>
<p>and then Brandon was just hanging with us, and he remembers all the stats of what happened</p>
<p>for that, whatever, half hour.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bonkers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, since we took a week off, we apologize for taking the week off.</p>
<p>We regret it.</p>
<p>A couple of things have happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys look at the stats, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but we were the</p>
<p>41st most popular episode two episodes ago in the world, so the pod has reached some</p>
<p>sort of tipping point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re having this experience in Miami, David, but is everybody stopping</p>
<p>you to say they love All In, and did you see all the Spotify love of people who watched</p>
<p>like 3,000 minutes of All In in their year review?</p>
<p>That was a cover viral feature that Spotify came up with was a way to basically, it generates</p>
<p>a list of what your top shows were for the year based on listening minutes, so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>actually mathematical, and then you can basically retweet that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of tweets of people saying that we were number one or top five.</p>
<p>I had one guy stop me at Art Basel, I don&rsquo;t get stopped that much, but there is a little</p>
<p>bit more of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m getting stopped constantly, and it was just a flood.</p>
<p>So thank you to everybody who shared that and for tuning in, and we apologize for taking</p>
<p>weeks off.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have a no weeks off rule going forward, that&rsquo;s absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>But last week, we had a new variant come out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about it a whole bunch.</p>
<p>Well, you didn&rsquo;t talk about Miami.</p>
<p>How was Miami?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been having a good time?</p>
<p>Well, I got to tell a story about Miami.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I mean, I think this place is paradise.</p>
<p>First of all, the weather is just perfect this time of year.</p>
<p>San Francisco is miserable.</p>
<p>It was like raining and cold.</p>
<p>Then we come here and it&rsquo;s like mid-70s all week, and of course, you&rsquo;re not stepping over</p>
<p>hypodermic needles or feces, or you&rsquo;re not worried about being randomly assaulted by</p>
<p>a homeless drug addict having a psychotic break, just for starters, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been like talking all week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking all week.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just in your house.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>On the table.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just in the mausoleum before you get out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just going to Starbucks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just going to Starbucks.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in any event, we&rsquo;re having this conversation about, should we just move here full-time?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a heart-wrenching or gut-wrenching decision because the kids have schools and</p>
<p>friends and we&rsquo;ve been in California a long time.</p>
<p>And so here we are wringing our hands about whether to make this move.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, I read online that Nancy Pelosi just spent $25 million buying her retirement</p>
<p>house for when she loses the house in 2022, presumably she&rsquo;ll retire as Speaker, you know,</p>
<p>in January of 23, when she&rsquo;s not Speaker anymore.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to move to Santa Barbara?</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s moving to Florida.</p>
<p>She bought a place in Jupiter.</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>It was, yeah.</p>
<p>I know it turned out to be fake news.</p>
<p>Well, I questioned that.</p>
<p>I think it was true.</p>
<p>And then she didn&rsquo;t like the bad press, so they bailed out of that deal.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s true until January of 2023, where we see where she retires to.</p>
<p>But in any event, so I&rsquo;m reading this article and it says she&rsquo;s buying a house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where Tiger Woods lives.</p>
<p>And actually it&rsquo;s like half an hour from where Donald Trump is.</p>
<p>So here she is buying this house, probably with ill-gotten insider trading profits.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s going to live&hellip;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the best trader in the Senate.</p>
<p>Unbelievable trader.</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>All of our government officials, she&rsquo;s got the best insider information.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s planning to retire to a community of people she&rsquo;s demonized.</p>
<p>I mean, starting with like Trump and then Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s going to be living in this community of people who she&rsquo;s been moralizing against</p>
<p>and demonizing against as the Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the rest of us are wringing our hands about whether we should stay in</p>
<p>San Francisco, the city, the dystopian city that she&rsquo;s the political boss of, that her</p>
<p>political machine has run into the ground.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at this going like, oh, no, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not leaving me holding the bag for this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to Florida, I&rsquo;m definitely going to Florida.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely going to Florida.</p>
<p>You can turn the lights out, Saks.</p>
<p>You can turn the lights out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to just leave me holding the bag.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like the last one in San Francisco, I&rsquo;m going to be turning out the lights.</p>
<p>So did that tip the scale for you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m definitely out of here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, if the boss of San Francisco is out of here, I&rsquo;m definitely out of here.</p>
<p>But I have some people, some other people to convince.</p>
<p>But Saks, in fairness to Nancy Pelosi, she&rsquo;s sitting on a ton of equities and she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to pay cap gains in California.</p>
<p>So I mean, you got to be fair to her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like she wants to pay for the ridiculous spending in California when she does cash</p>
<p>out all those chips.</p>
<p>I guess, Freeberg, let&rsquo;s go to you to talk about the new variant.</p>
<p>Maybe you could tell us how to pronounce it because there seems to be some debate about</p>
<p>the pronunciation of this and what&rsquo;s your take on it?</p>
<p>Were you in a frat in college?</p>
<p>You have to remember the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>No, I went to school at night.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have the college experience.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I went to night school.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Try it again, J-Cal.</p>
<p>Last time.</p>
<p>One last time.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no N.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s monetize the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>Megatron?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a transformer, J-Cal.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>Omicron.</p>
<p>I missed you, Saks.</p>
<p>Wait, how many miles away from here?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go get a Cuban sandwich after this.</p>
<p>Yeah, come over here.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you guys together right now?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I thought you guys would be in the same room.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the Cuban deli and play, I don&rsquo;t know, Cuban sandwich chicken.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Who could eat less bites as we lose our ways?</p>
<p>I have the place.</p>
<p>I got the sandwich place over in Little Havana.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>But anyway, continue.</p>
<p>Tell us if it&rsquo;s the end of the world or no worry.</p>
<p>No, I mean, at this point, there&rsquo;s three things that scientists are looking out for data on.</p>
<p>One is kind of the innate transmissibility of this variant.</p>
<p>The second is&hellip;</p>
<p>Which is like the R0 in an unvaccinated population.</p>
<p>The second is immune evasion, meaning it can get around antibodies or get around people</p>
<p>that are vaccinated or have the virus.</p>
<p>And then third is kind of the severity, right?</p>
<p>Which is like how many people translate into hospitalized cases.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So every day, there&rsquo;s varying data and information coming out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible spike in South African surveillance data and testing data.</p>
<p>Right now, as of today, I think 25% of people getting tested in South Africa are testing positive.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stunning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And only about a quarter of the population is vaccinated there.</p>
<p>So this will be pretty telling pretty quickly on if hospitalizations start to climb and</p>
<p>if the disease severity in an unvaccinated population kind of matches or mimics what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen with other variants.</p>
<p>This variant is quite different.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like 30 mutations on the spike protein here.</p>
<p>Normally, you&rsquo;ll see an evolution where one mutation leads to another variant, leads to</p>
<p>another variant.</p>
<p>And they call it a new variant when there&rsquo;s enough kind of differential behavior of the</p>
<p>virus.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always mutations happening.</p>
<p>But once a mutation causes a change in behavior, they note it.</p>
<p>So normally, you see kind of an evolutionary track where there&rsquo;s like one mutation, then</p>
<p>another, then another, and so on.</p>
<p>In this case, this mutation set is so far away from anything else that exists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like 30 new mutations that popped up on this protein, on the sequences for this</p>
<p>protein, that it&rsquo;s like such a different virus.</p>
<p>This is a major upgrade.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When did they&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a new virus altogether.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s not a naturally occurring virus that behaves like other viruses do.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So cutting the conspiracy&hellip;</p>
<p>When did China upgrade the virus?</p>
<p>Let me cut the conspiracy theory for a second and just say what the kind of current consensus</p>
<p>thinking is of what may have caused this incredible change.</p>
<p>One is that someone or some people that have severe immune compromised systems had a virus</p>
<p>in them that did not kill them, but just kept circulating in their bodies for months and</p>
<p>months and months, and mutated so much that it got to the point&hellip;</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>It got to the point that it mutated such that it can now transmit amongst a vaccinated population.</p>
<p>So think about the virus finally found a way out of the floodgates and the floodgates are</p>
<p>blocked in by vaccinated people.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>The other one is that South Africa is just a monitoring station.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole big chunk of Africa where we have no surveillance going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no genetic sequencing going on.</p>
<p>And there could have been anywhere in Southern Africa or even in Central Africa that these</p>
<p>viruses could have been circulating amongst populations for the last year and a half with</p>
<p>no surveillance or testing or sequencing.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, one person travels to South Africa and boom, this thing pops up</p>
<p>on the radar and everyone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>wow, look at what we just stumbled into.</p>
<p>So, look, one thing that seems pretty certain, this variant is going to be everywhere fast.</p>
<p>Like, it is so transmissible by some estimates and you can read Trevor Bedford or there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bunch of great folks on Twitter, you can kind of follow their writings on this.</p>
<p>But Trevor&rsquo;s done a great job.</p>
<p>The R naught on this could be as high as 40, which is, you know, measles by comparison</p>
<p>is 12 to 13.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s more likely that the R naught is somewhere between seven and 20.</p>
<p>But regardless, it seems to be that high in the presence of an immune, immunized population,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s got incredibly good evasiveness around people that have the vaccine or have</p>
<p>had the virus.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s going to spread like crazy.</p>
<p>I think this whole thing is a complete fucking nothing burger.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s the other side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, maybe it&rsquo;s just not a big deal and it ends up being like Delta and it sort</p>
<p>of spreads around.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know they have it.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s even more impotent than Delta.</p>
<p>So, that is definitely something that people are saying because there&rsquo;s not a lot of new</p>
<p>hospitalization spiking in South Africa.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not seeing severe cases of all these people, you know, 25% of people are testing</p>
<p>positive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re showing mild to no symptoms and that&rsquo;s anecdotal right now.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll know in the next two weeks of whether this actually changes hospitalization.</p>
<p>To me, this is more of an example of yet again, how unreliable our institutions are than anything</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>We knew nothing about this.</p>
<p>We had a couple of cases and the mainstream media literally in a moment where there was</p>
<p>frankly, not a lot of news.</p>
<p>Slowest news day of the year is the day after Thanksgiving for people.</p>
<p>This is when it broke Friday after Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Essentially, manufactured this histrionic reaction to something where we didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anything about it.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how important it was.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how bad it was.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>And then what happened was then the financial media took that and then ran with it basically</p>
<p>trying to whip up even more histrionics, but within the financial markets, which then feed</p>
<p>the mainstream news cycle.</p>
<p>And we have this whole loop going down the toilet bowl.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, I think what we&rsquo;re actually learning is what we should have just waited</p>
<p>a few days to realize beforehand, which is it&rsquo;s not that severe, but to the extent that</p>
<p>it is, we&rsquo;ve sequenced it.</p>
<p>We have vaccines and we can deploy these quickly.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, at the same time, the New England Journal of Medicine put out the study,</p>
<p>which basically showed how important and efficacious these vaccines are.</p>
<p>So the fact that we&rsquo;re even talking about this to me is just absolutely emotional and</p>
<p>not practical or useful.</p>
<p>The big question Chamath is, it&rsquo;s not about whether it is functionally a nothing burger</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really important now is how policymakers are going to respond to this, right?</p>
<p>Because there is a press cycle.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a hysteria.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s asking me about it.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s freaked out about it.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s worrying about it.</p>
<p>And so the policymakers are going to respond to that sentiment.</p>
<p>And the question is, are we about to face more lockdowns and things that are going to</p>
<p>be adverse to the economy?</p>
<p>And how are markets going to react?</p>
<p>Not necessarily to the true severity of the risk of this variant, but more importantly</p>
<p>to the policy decisions that are going to come out of the perceived risk of this variant.</p>
<p>And that seems pretty scary right now.</p>
<p>Well, you saw Biden.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing I&rsquo;ll give him is this.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s I think he&rsquo;s done a bad job on a lot of other things.</p>
<p>But on this, his political instincts were sound, which is he said very clearly, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to go back to lockdowns.</p>
<p>And I think he was really speaking to Democratic governors when he said that to people like</p>
<p>Avid Newsom and our poker friend JB Pritzker and Whitmer in Michigan.</p>
<p>Listen, guys, we&rsquo;re not going back to lockdowns no matter what happens with this Omicron thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to do school closures.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen how unpopular the school closures were in this off-year election.</p>
<p>It was one of the big issues that helped Glenn Youngkin win Virginia, which had previously</p>
<p>voted for Biden by 10.</p>
<p>So I think you saw the message come down from on high.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to go back to lockdowns.</p>
<p>Now, I think, though, that what that does is admit, and I think what Omicron will show</p>
<p>is that lockdowns didn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
<p>At most, lockdowns and all these measures, whether it&rsquo;s mask mandates or whatever, all</p>
<p>it did was delay the timing of the virus.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re going to see is Omicron will be everywhere very soon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that policymakers can do to stop it.</p>
<p>The only thing that seems to work is vaccines and booster shots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some good data around the third booster preventing serious cases.</p>
<p>Other than vaccines, and I guess the one thing policymakers could do would be to get red</p>
<p>tape out of the way so that they can more quickly come up with a booster to this new</p>
<p>variant.</p>
<p>That would be the one thing they could really help with.</p>
<p>But otherwise, nothing policymakers have done has helped.</p>
<p>And I think this is going to be an admission that ultimately lockdowns were a disaster</p>
<p>for the economy.</p>
<p>Nobody could argue lockdowns are not a disaster for the economy.</p>
<p>But in the early days, if we go back to when this pandemic started, we really didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to handle this.</p>
<p>We did not have any treatments, and we were ventilating people and essentially killing</p>
<p>them by blowing oxygen into their lungs too aggressively, from what I understand.</p>
<p>So in a way, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a debate because we&rsquo;re not ventilating people now as much as</p>
<p>we were, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re flipping them over, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the lockdowns did, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, Friedberg, at least allow us to not have the</p>
<p>hospitals overrun like they were in New York and Italy.</p>
<p>And that was&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know if the hospital&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the lockdowns actually changed the&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m going to sound like some&hellip;</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to, you know, kind of enter into this controversial territory.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Sure, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of people still got together in private settings.</p>
<p>Oh, of course.</p>
<p>And the virus continued to spread.</p>
<p>And so there was a question around how effective lockdowns were and how much they really did</p>
<p>change the trajectory of the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>And yes, they probably did have a muting effect.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s unclear what the trade-off was and whether it was really worthwhile.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, a few days and a few weeks after they started, people were</p>
<p>over them.</p>
<p>And they started meeting on their own.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how deadly it was, though.</p>
<p>At that time, we didn&rsquo;t know how deadly it was.</p>
<p>Admittedly, we didn&rsquo;t know a lot at the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And so you have to, I think, give people a break for the mistakes that were made, say,</p>
<p>in March or April.</p>
<p>I think by May, it was pretty clear the lockdowns weren&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>If they had worked, states like California wouldn&rsquo;t have had 10 pages of exceptions based</p>
<p>on how politically connected you were.</p>
<p>So, for example, the local bartender had her bar run out of business by lockdowns, but</p>
<p>Hollywood studios would get a break on their productions.</p>
<p>So, we know that lockdowns didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been these exceptions.</p>
<p>And we have data from Sweden.</p>
<p>Remember all the hysteria about Sweden, basically, was doing nothing.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t doing lockdowns.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t doing mandates.</p>
<p>They were going for herd immunity.</p>
<p>They were going for herd immunity.</p>
<p>And they were killing their people.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>Sweden&rsquo;s data was no worse than anybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The hospitals weren&rsquo;t overrun.</p>
<p>And I think what Omicron will finally show is that, you know, our whole policy since</p>
<p>the beginning of COVID, whether it was two weeks to stop the spread, or these, like,</p>
<p>vaccine mandates, or even this idea of herd immunity, it&rsquo;s all been to try and put the</p>
<p>genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s been to try and defeat COVID.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to put this virus back in the lab, I guess you could say.</p>
<p>And the reality is we&rsquo;re never going to defeat it.</p>
<p>I mean, it really is something that we&rsquo;re going to have to learn to live with and to</p>
<p>manage.</p>
<p>And so, you know, vaccine should be a variant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a seasonal disease.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be something like the flu, in terms of how it cycles each year.</p>
<p>And it seems unlikely that it&rsquo;s going to be eradicated through vaccination.</p>
<p>Let me pull Chamath back in.</p>
<p>There may be a variant that matters.</p>
<p>But this is not it.</p>
<p>Instead, what we really need to do is have a process of not overreacting, because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be n number of these into the future.</p>
<p>And the only thing that really decays the vaccine&rsquo;s potency, or sorry, the COVID&rsquo;s potency</p>
<p>is having it go through vaccinated people.</p>
<p>And thank God we had so many people vaccinated because this is what we&rsquo;re so again, this</p>
<p>whole thing is a nothing burger.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just move on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Well, so the market, the markets are obviously reacting, maybe we should talk about reacting</p>
<p>to that.</p>
<p>I think that they are using an excuse, like people want to trim positions.</p>
<p>And this is a great excuse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look at look, look, the week before, when I started to trim, it was like, Oh, how dare</p>
<p>you, blah, blah, blah, you know, and I&rsquo;m like, Well, I don&rsquo;t know if the smartest people</p>
<p>are selling, maybe it makes makes sense to sell.</p>
<p>So I started to trim and I&rsquo;m so glad that I did because it was, you know, 10 days ahead</p>
<p>or a week ahead of all of this craziness.</p>
<p>Now look at what&rsquo;s happening in the markets today.</p>
<p>People are going massively risk off, you know, there are almost 500 stocks that are off 30</p>
<p>or 40% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the stock market is still basically at all time highs.</p>
<p>So think of that for a second.</p>
<p>So everybody that thinks that the stock market is doing poorly is wrong.</p>
<p>It is doing exceptionally well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the 400 stocks that people in Silicon Valley really care about have been</p>
<p>getting kicked in the teeth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the paper company and the, you know, the specialty chemicals company have actually</p>
<p>done reasonably well, which is nothing that any of us have exposure to, or, you know,</p>
<p>some of us don&rsquo;t have exposure to.</p>
<p>So go ahead, Jason.</p>
<p>Can we can we can we then look at this as, hey, the era of, we&rsquo;re going to give a lot</p>
<p>of credit to companies for, you know, what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next 10 years, 10 year</p>
<p>outcomes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>10 year outcome that we saw Rivian came up, you know, and then many other stocks, and</p>
<p>obviously, crypto falls into this, this idea of giving people a decade of forward looking</p>
<p>credit, maybe is going to come back to think it&rsquo;s too early way these and look at earnings</p>
<p>or maybe two years of credit.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not going to say that, because I think it&rsquo;s too early for us to sort of go and jump</p>
<p>to these conclusions.</p>
<p>Right now, we are in a moment, there have been 71 or two of these moments since 2009.</p>
<p>Where you have either a sector drawdown, or a market drawdown.</p>
<p>In this case, we&rsquo;re in the middle of a massive growth sector drawdown, okay, the multiples</p>
<p>on these companies are shrinking companies like snowflake and peloton.</p>
<p>Sure, cloudflare, zoom, we&rsquo;re trading at 70 to 100 times revenue, and people are reevaluating</p>
<p>whether those multiples are worth it, irrespective of the quality of the company, because those</p>
<p>are very high quality companies.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just rewriting the risk right now.</p>
<p>Okay, and it&rsquo;s not broad based.</p>
<p>The real problem is all these companies that I think raised a lot of money in private markets</p>
<p>are now going to get stuck, because if the public markets have compressed multiples by</p>
<p>30 to 50%, they are the ultimate buyer.</p>
<p>The idea that you can wait and then go public later, may not stand to reason, especially</p>
<p>if inflation really keeps these multiples in, you know, in check.</p>
<p>And so all these private businesses, and then all of the ones that sort of were planning</p>
<p>IPOs in the next 12 to 18 months are probably in a little bit more of a challenging spot</p>
<p>than they were.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing a lot of I mean, come on, is it not true that we&rsquo;re seeing a bunch of these</p>
<p>SPAC deals and new issuances come out to market with converts attached to them.</p>
<p>So rather than getting a straight valuation and common equity rolled, these deals are</p>
<p>coming out where investors are saying, look, I&rsquo;ll value this thing, but I want to get paid</p>
<p>a preferred return, and I want to have some seniority over the common.</p>
<p>And so I can protect my investment to some degree.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hearing from bankers is kind of the rumbling in the SPAC and pipe</p>
<p>market right now is these kind of protective new types of equities that are coming out</p>
<p>in order that the investors can kind of keep their mark on their private valuation rounds,</p>
<p>but get the company out to public, but the public market is getting a better deal than</p>
<p>just straight common equity.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s like bringing Pepto Bismol to Mexico.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about an upset stomach, don&rsquo;t go to Mexico.</p>
<p>Okay, and we just lost 7% of the audience.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying you wouldn&rsquo;t invest in these converts for these kind of companies that</p>
<p>need that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re focusing too much on the symptomology and not the root cause.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The minute that you&rsquo;re trying to wrap all these features around something, you know,</p>
<p>the nature of those kinds of features is that it&rsquo;s trying to subsidize what is otherwise</p>
<p>not a clear, simple, viable story at that price.</p>
<p>So either change the price or change the company.</p>
<p>Yeah, I will say one important point about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>A lot of people have said this is a crash and that terms have been used a lot.</p>
<p>But, you know, because people that have only traded in markets and have a brief history,</p>
<p>call it back to the 2000s, the last three major drawdowns have been the dot com crash,</p>
<p>then the financial crisis, and then the COVID crash.</p>
<p>And all of them had true systemic risk that caused kind of, there&rsquo;s all these ripple effects</p>
<p>and secondary effects.</p>
<p>And Chamath, I mean, you know, and for all you guys, it seems to me that this time what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on is a devaluation that doesn&rsquo;t have systemic risk attached to it.</p>
<p>If these&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we had&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>We had this happen in 2018, because in 2018, it looked like there was going to be inflation.</p>
<p>Powell, you know, basically killed the market.</p>
<p>He raised rates.</p>
<p>And then it turned out he was completely wrong, and China was okay, and everything was fine.</p>
<p>And then the market just completely violently snapped back.</p>
<p>Again, this is what I&rsquo;m saying, which is, it&rsquo;s too early to tell whether this is just</p>
<p>a short term opportunity for people who have made a lot of money to de-risk.</p>
<p>And Satya Nadella just sold 300 million in stock.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it half his position?</p>
<p>Half his position.</p>
<p>It was half of his position.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that to me was insignificant.</p>
<p>Elon Musk sold, you know, 10 billion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sold almost, I think, six or $700 million worth of stuff this year.</p>
<p>Like, this is what I think smart market participants do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just wait and just try to mark to market the last tick.</p>
<p>Sax, you think there is systemic risk in here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so, well, look, first of all, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>I mean, Mr. Moth is right that over the last four weeks, we&rsquo;ve seen a 30% to 50% decline</p>
<p>in these tech growth stocks.</p>
<p>What is the reason for that?</p>
<p>Interest rate expectations driven by inflation.</p>
<p>For the first six months of the year, all you heard out of Washington, the administration,</p>
<p>was this inflation was transitory.</p>
<p>That story is basically that collapsed because now people can see that as persistent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now pricing in the risk of interest rate increases.</p>
<p>Oh, Sax, you&rsquo;re breaking up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s toast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s toast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably still talking.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably still talking.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s on a monologue right now.</p>
<p>Henry Belcaster is cutting it right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, Henry Belcaster can TikTok him.</p>
<p>Well, whoever wrote this part of the speech that he has prepared for his fault.</p>
<p>Super crestfallen.</p>
<p>Like, oh, that was my best speech writing.</p>
<p>Whatever that guy&rsquo;s name is, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s annotated so he can go back to that point</p>
<p>in his diatribe.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I think actually this is an AI version.</p>
<p>This is like a deep fake of Sax that we just played at this point for this monologue.</p>
<p>Reboot the Sax.</p>
<p>Can we reboot the Sax simulation?</p>
<p>The Sax simulation?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you look at private markets, it&rsquo;s obvious that they were getting ahead</p>
<p>of themselves.</p>
<p>And I think to your point, Shamath, when we were talking before about what private market</p>
<p>companies do in this situation, well, I was advising them if you can get at a high valuation</p>
<p>and you can get clean terms, you take the money, sure, if it&rsquo;s from quality investors.</p>
<p>But just make sure that you have enough runway to fill into this valuation if there is valuation</p>
<p>compression, which is what there is now.</p>
<p>So the idea that a private company with 20 million or 30 million in SaaS revenue was</p>
<p>worth 50, 60, 70 times that, that&rsquo;s not the case right now in the public markets.</p>
<p>And maybe it goes back down to 20 or 30, but you just have to have that runway to land</p>
<p>the playing, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One way to think about that is it&rsquo;s less about people often use that high multiple to refer</p>
<p>to this year&rsquo;s numbers.</p>
<p>But what the market is doing typically in those situations is they&rsquo;re saying the multiple</p>
<p>in the future will be X.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re saying we project five, 10 years out this revenue and I&rsquo;m paying one</p>
<p>to five times revenue, you know, for seven to 10 years out or whatever the right kind</p>
<p>of way that they&rsquo;re framing that up.</p>
<p>But then the commentators on the market pricing come in and they say, Hey, you guys are crazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying a hundred times revenue.</p>
<p>And the market isn&rsquo;t thinking about this year&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking about revenue in years seven through 10.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That giving credit, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re giving credit, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t do that now because interest rates, let&rsquo;s say interest rates climbed to</p>
<p>three and a half percent.</p>
<p>I can go make three and a half percent by putting my money in for a 10 year bond.</p>
<p>And now I can&rsquo;t kind of, and so I have to discount that future back from 10 years out.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m only going to be able to value it in five years out.</p>
<p>So now my revenue for five years out is like a little bit lower and the multiple I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to give them a little lower.</p>
<p>So the valuation today gets a little bit lower.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how these things kind of translate as a function of interest rates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit harder to make a bet on a 10 year horizon because interest rates are</p>
<p>no longer 0%.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of make a bet on a five year horizon or a three year horizon.</p>
<p>And if interest rates are really high, you&rsquo;re betting on this year&rsquo;s numbers.</p>
<p>Chamath, I think we should talk a little bit about this inflation concept.</p>
<p>I did a little tweet storm, you know, about this sort of transitory versus, you know,</p>
<p>perpetual.</p>
<p>And I do think we&rsquo;ve talked about it here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve crossed that rubric on of everybody is raising prices because everybody else is</p>
<p>raising prices, not necessarily even because they are experiencing, you know, higher costs</p>
<p>in their business.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re just like, you know, my haircuts costing more, my stakes costing more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to charge more for whatever my services is.</p>
<p>Is there any way to unwind this inflation?</p>
<p>It seems to me like the reason we&rsquo;ve had no inflation for so many decades of our entire</p>
<p>lives, like I mean, jeans in the 1980s cost the same as jeans now was because of globalization</p>
<p>and efficiency.</p>
<p>Well, that took, what, three decades or four decades of just constant innovation and constant</p>
<p>globalization.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve already got globalization maxed out, perhaps too much globalization, right,</p>
<p>that we learned that we actually have risk associated with this, you know, supply chain.</p>
<p>And how much more efficiency is there in making a pair of jeans?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re going to be making them in a slurry.</p>
<p>So is there a path to unwind it?</p>
<p>You know, rich people not having their equities be worth as much, then maybe it trickles down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s unprecedented, right?</p>
<p>I think what happens in the stock market is absolutely irrelevant.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we focus on it a lot.</p>
<p>But, you know, when we talk about the core structural economy, the stock market is a</p>
<p>lagging indicator of a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s cash flow.</p>
<p>A lot of the times it&rsquo;s emotion, money supply, money supply.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a much more important thing which we&rsquo;ve talked about, which is that,</p>
<p>you know, we have said and I have said that coming out of the pandemic, we are moving</p>
<p>the world back into a more, you know, decentralized place, right?</p>
<p>The centralization was this just in time, you know, single supply chain, single point</p>
<p>of failure existence.</p>
<p>And if you look inside of China, the thing that they want more than anything else is</p>
<p>to become even more centralized, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw today, but there was an article in the Wall Street Journal about</p>
<p>how China is going to create basically an overall holding company to own all the rare</p>
<p>earths that are made inside of China, and then to apportion them out as they see fit.</p>
<p>So, the government will now control a critical element and supply chain into climate change.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re creating their own OPEC in a way, like their own version of&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good way of saying it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, China is pushing more and more for centralization.</p>
<p>We&hellip;</p>
<p>So, for example, you know, myself and Fortress, we did this deal a year ago to bring this</p>
<p>company public called MP Materials.</p>
<p>And the whole idea was to start to build diversity in the supply chain, to build a decentralized</p>
<p>supply of all kinds of things.</p>
<p>In that case, it was around these rare earths, because we saw this thing happening in China.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The problem is those kinds of investments are very much few and far between.</p>
<p>So, the solution to fixing the core structural inflation we have is going to take a decade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take trillions of dollars of investment.</p>
<p>And more than that, I think it&rsquo;s going to take an enormous amount of coordination between</p>
<p>private and public participants.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s where this whole thing fails, which is why, you know, I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bit more concerned about it.</p>
<p>Like, and I think I&rsquo;ve explained this to you.</p>
<p>But look, we have massively underinvested in the level of infrastructure we need to</p>
<p>support ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, we outsource.</p>
<p>Like, as in a simple example, like starting in 2016, we absolutely decapitated the ability</p>
<p>for the United States to invest in our own true energy independence.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know, the level of fracking, the level of nat gas, oil, all of this stuff basically</p>
<p>fell off of a cliff.</p>
<p>And you would say, well, that was the right capital allocation decision because of climate</p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out today, not really, because we have absolutely no investments on the climate</p>
<p>change side.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have rare earth, we don&rsquo;t have lithium, we don&rsquo;t have nickel, we don&rsquo;t have cobalt,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have graphite.</p>
<p>So, we actually can&rsquo;t make the batteries, which means that now oil is at $100 a barrel</p>
<p>and gas costs 10 bucks at the pump.</p>
<p>So, that was a coordination problem.</p>
<p>Really, the right thing to have done would have been to continue to invest in our domestic</p>
<p>supply chain for energy, while we also created incentives to decarbonize.</p>
<p>So, this is what I mean by these issues have been building up for years, Jason.</p>
<p>Yeah, decades.</p>
<p>Inflation is now here.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s here to last.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty consistent about this.</p>
<p>And this is the real reason why we&rsquo;re going to have a few years of pain.</p>
<p>And so, money losing, unprofitable businesses selling future cash flows in 10 to 12 years.</p>
<p>I mean, some people will buy them, but I won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>I just sent you a link to freight rates for cargo ships coming from China to LA.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see in the last month and a half or so&hellip;</p>
<p>September was the peak, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, starting in April, it was like, whatever, $2,000 and it climbed up to nearly 20, nearly</p>
<p>went 10x over that period of time.</p>
<p>And then in September, it started to decline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dropped by 50% and it&rsquo;s continuing to drop week after week right now.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing the same in lumber prices right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you another link to how lumber prices have declined precipitously.</p>
<p>Also, from an early part of the year peak.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing this across a lot of these supply markets where we were talking about</p>
<p>inflation being the driver and some of the other&hellip;</p>
<p>A lot of the economists at the Fed and other policymakers were talking about these being</p>
<p>transitory pricing effects.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a bit of a mixed bag emerging.</p>
<p>We are seeing in some of these markets that prices have declined by 50%, 75% in just the</p>
<p>last few weeks.</p>
<p>By the way&hellip;</p>
<p>The supply chain distortions have right-sized and the demand and the supply started to balance</p>
<p>out a bit more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s creating, I think, a better certainty around pricing, better reliability on these</p>
<p>supply chains.</p>
<p>And a lot of folks estimate that this will take all the way through 2022 for that supply</p>
<p>chain glut and mismatch to work its way all the way through to the consumer.</p>
<p>Indigestion.</p>
<p>Yeah, to the consumer.</p>
<p>And so there are a number of points of view that say, look, these pricing issues that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been seeing in the recent term may, in fact, still be transitory.</p>
<p>We may see them work their way out at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to see the early signs of that actually playing out.</p>
<p>And so I would say the jury is still out.</p>
<p>Generally, we&rsquo;ve obviously doubled the amount of US dollars that are in supply or increased</p>
<p>it by 50% a year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got, you know, interest rates at zero.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got, you know, people aren&rsquo;t going to reduce their wages, right?</p>
<p>Wages are only going to go up.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of things that you make the point of, like, spending is only going</p>
<p>to go up.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s never going to spend less.</p>
<p>By the way, just on that point, the government changed their formula for what is considered</p>
<p>a conforming mortgage.</p>
<p>I think it kicks in in January.</p>
<p>And essentially, it basically allows US homeowners to have a million-dollar mortgage and have</p>
<p>it essentially be conforming.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s like a, you know, pretty large increase.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost 20% from what it used to be.</p>
<p>Why is that important?</p>
<p>Think of the amount of money that&rsquo;s stuck in US real estate by US homeowners, who now</p>
<p>all of a sudden can have conforming loans that are, you know, which used to be jumbos</p>
<p>or super jumbos.</p>
<p>So worse terms become better terms.</p>
<p>You have more equity, you can pull out more money.</p>
<p>I think that people will spend that money.</p>
<p>And so even on the consumer side, I think that you have an impetus to spend.</p>
<p>I was the one thing I wanted to say, I wanted to clarify something I said earlier.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s very difficult to buy these, you know, long dated businesses promising</p>
<p>huge cash flows in the future.</p>
<p>There is one kind of version of that company, though, that you can buy, in my opinion, and</p>
<p>what I am still buying, which is deep physical science and R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Because those businesses in some ways are still on a risk adjusted basis, in my opinion,</p>
<p>great bets to make.</p>
<p>But otherwise, you know, you want to be allocated to spending a lot of money on research and</p>
<p>are going to have future products.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a lot of money, but that the outcome in success is</p>
<p>so asymmetric.</p>
<p>Those are really interesting to me businesses in moments like this were, you know, if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m delivering my portfolio, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m thinking about it, which is I want to</p>
<p>make those kind of bets in the future.</p>
<p>The one thing I think that could help unwind this and I think it&rsquo;s to your point, Friedberg</p>
<p>about some of the indigestion is starting to work its way through the system.</p>
<p>And there could be two things occurring at the same time, we could be have more money</p>
<p>supply, prices could be going up, homes could be going up, lumber could be coming down.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the person constructing a home is just going to magically say, Oh,</p>
<p>wow, I spent less on lumber, I can take a million dollars off the price of this new</p>
<p>home or 100,000, even whatever it is.</p>
<p>But competition does seem to drive prices lower.</p>
<p>And so if we do see more people participating as employees or employment, well, then there</p>
<p>would be some competition for less competition for labor.</p>
<p>And we might see more competition other places in the economy, if there were more cars available.</p>
<p>Obviously, people will try to win customers right now, you don&rsquo;t have to win a customer</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re selling a car, even a used one, they&rsquo;re going for 1020 k used cars are going</p>
<p>people who bought used cars two years ago, are selling them for the same price.</p>
<p>So they got two years for free in their car, even though they put 10,000 miles on it.</p>
<p>By the way, speaking about employment for a second, you know, the the I heard I saw</p>
<p>the stat, it was pretty insane.</p>
<p>But about 2.1 million people under immigrated to the United States at the beginning of Trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tenure as president.</p>
<p>What that means is that what it&rsquo;s what that what that means is that we lost about 2.1</p>
<p>million immigrants than we would have normally based on the run rate of how immigration should</p>
<p>have worked.</p>
<p>So whether that was people being rejected at the border, or whether that was just people</p>
<p>deciding not to come to the United States because of their feelings for Trump, we lost</p>
<p>2.1 million eligible workers over those four years of his presidency.</p>
<p>We also had a bunch of people who had degrees in certain jobs who basically gave up on their</p>
<p>profession.</p>
<p>And we talked about this before, which is, you know, the teacher who decides it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>off to just go work at Amazon, right than to actually be a teacher because you actually</p>
<p>get paid more now.</p>
<p>And then the third thing is that there&rsquo;s a ton of people that are making an enormous</p>
<p>amount of money through inheritance and through their parents who are boomers, who are now</p>
<p>in their 60s, 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>And all of that is exacerbating this employment problem, which you can only solve by raising</p>
<p>wages, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of more people in the country.</p>
<p>Well, all of it just means that there are fewer people to do the work, which means you</p>
<p>are going to have to pay more to get the work done.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to or we could let more people in the country based on their specific</p>
<p>skills.</p>
<p>You put these two things together, structural inflation is here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve under investigated under invested at the macro level.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve completely distorted people&rsquo;s incentives to work at the micro level.</p>
<p>Prices go up.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m seeing in the market, and I think David&rsquo;s back with us, David Sachs, is</p>
<p>that Kiefer boy had this tweet, and I think we talked about a four or five episodes ago,</p>
<p>a bunch of capital allocators are saying, you know, what was a great run.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;m going to opt out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to move on to my next adventure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to deal with what we&rsquo;re dealing with here on this podcast, which is what do</p>
<p>you even make of this confluence of the pandemic crypto, you know, printing more money supply</p>
<p>and interest and unknowable valuations in the face of massive technological change from</p>
<p>AI, biology, etc.</p>
<p>So I thought it&rsquo;d be interesting to talk about all of our decisions to stay in the capital</p>
<p>allocation game and what we think about this retiring group of capital allocators who are,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s face it, retiring at 50 or less.</p>
<p>I had coffee with Keith this morning, and then he tweeted that on the heels of our conversation.</p>
<p>So I think I can provide a little more insight into what he was thinking there.</p>
<p>I think part of the backdrop here is the concern that we&rsquo;re going into a very different</p>
<p>environment than what we&rsquo;ve had over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>I mean, over the last 10 years, we&rsquo;ve basically had record good times because of this low</p>
<p>interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And low interest rate environments are fantastic for growth stocks.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like we&rsquo;re moving into an environment in which inflation is certainly not</p>
<p>transitory.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s going to last for.</p>
<p>And that creates an expectation of which rates are going to rise.</p>
<p>And so the next decade may not be as good for growth stocks.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also had over the last year or two, price levels have been much higher.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to figure there&rsquo;s a whole cohort of VCs who&rsquo;ve had a great decade, who&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>a lot of money.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re asking, does it really make sense for me to sign up for another decade</p>
<p>that may not look as good?</p>
<p>And the truth is, if you&rsquo;re not the principal of your firm, if you&rsquo;re one of 20 partners,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense for you to stay in the game when you&rsquo;ve just had a fantastic</p>
<p>decade.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably made more money than you thought you&rsquo;re going to make.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re not so sure about the next one.</p>
<p>Pretty brave thoughts.</p>
<p>I mean, you still want to build companies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I like building stuff and building new stuff that&rsquo;s kind of going to have an impact and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s technically difficult.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of where I get drawn to spend my time.</p>
<p>But I can understand people whose job it is to kind of manage other people&rsquo;s money and</p>
<p>invest it for them.</p>
<p>And they participate in the profits they generate.</p>
<p>Realizing after some period of time, like, hey, I bought a bunch of lottery tickets.</p>
<p>I mean, if you buy lottery tickets at the local 7-Eleven every day, and one day you</p>
<p>hit the $12 million jackpot, you&rsquo;re not going back to 7-Eleven the next day to keep buying</p>
<p>lottery tickets.</p>
<p>And so, in the context of being a money manager to generate returns, and that being kind of</p>
<p>your principal interest, and you kind of hit a return outcome, that statistically, you</p>
<p>know, will not happen again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the point of the hassle of going back to work.</p>
<p>I could see the psychology of saying that that&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>
<p>I do think, however, most VCs are truly&hellip;</p>
<p>We can kind of generalize all we want.</p>
<p>But as we all know, we have lots of friends who are VCs.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, generally, the majority of them are very intellectually curious and driven.</p>
<p>And what I am seeing is a shift of people who have had successful investing track records</p>
<p>and have had massive outcomes, shifting their attention now.</p>
<p>They take some time off.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say almost 100% of them come back, and they always ask for a meeting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, sure.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like, I want to work on climate change solutions.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m seeing is this kind of second act happening now.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen it with guys like Chris Sacca, and folks who had these massive, massive outcomes</p>
<p>in their first run.</p>
<p>They know they&rsquo;re not going to&hellip;</p>
<p>The statistical likelihood of doing that again is very low.</p>
<p>But then after spending a couple years on the ranch or surfing, you wake up and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I want to do something meaningful with my life.</p>
<p>I got kids.</p>
<p>I look them in the eye and I&rsquo;m like, what should we do to get&hellip;</p>
<p>What do I want to do for the future for my children?</p>
<p>And they all come back around.</p>
<p>So one of the things I&rsquo;m seeing is this second act phenomenon where VCs are moving away from</p>
<p>being pure play technologists and making money to saying, I want to do stuff that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>bit more meaningful and altruistic coming into climate change.</p>
<p>And as a result, we&rsquo;re seeing insane funding happening in climate change tech companies</p>
<p>or climate tech or whatever the heck the label is this week.</p>
<p>Stuff that, in my opinion, doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Businesses that aren&rsquo;t real businesses, technologies that don&rsquo;t actually make sense, it&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>work out.</p>
<p>But hey, that&rsquo;s always been the case in venture, right?</p>
<p>One out of 1000 works and changes the world.</p>
<p>But we are seeing that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of a personal observation as I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of these second acts going</p>
<p>after climate change.</p>
<p>Chamatha, this last year or 18 months, pretty exhausting as a capital allocator to try to</p>
<p>make sense of the world and get your bearings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like going through multiple storms.</p>
<p>Does that make you more engaged?</p>
<p>I get the sense, knowing you for a long time, that you and I might be similar.</p>
<p>Yeah, the chessboards are getting mixed up, the pieces and the values are getting changed,</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making me more excited to participate and try to figure it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a hand to poker to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more intellectually stimulated now.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the most engaged I&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I left the money management business five years ago, I guess.</p>
<p>And honestly, it was a very hard path.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been the most rewarding.</p>
<p>Because I was able to focus on the things that I wanted.</p>
<p>Look, if you do this job, well, this job is voting for change with your money.</p>
<p>And making change using money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Because money is not that useful beyond a very small amount.</p>
<p>And then you have to question, like, what are your real priorities?</p>
<p>So, yeah, like grinding away at something that matters, to me, I&rsquo;ve always found fulfilling.</p>
<p>And I feel like I am an athlete whose muscle doesn&rsquo;t decay by my mid-30s, but probably</p>
<p>decays in my 70s or 80s, which is my brain.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I&rsquo;m only, you know, I&rsquo;m only I&rsquo;m a rookie.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>The fact that things are compressing, or maybe there&rsquo;ll be less startups or less capital</p>
<p>allocators involved, what I&rsquo;ve seen in my career, post dot com era web 2.0, amazing</p>
<p>time to be alive, amazing time, because there were less anybody who started a company after</p>
<p>the dot com bust, or after the 2008 financial crisis, was a legitimate warrior who wanted</p>
<p>to change the world and was incredibly focused.</p>
<p>And then the sense of entitlement I&rsquo;m seeing on all sides of the table right now from founders</p>
<p>to board members to investors, it just seems like everybody&rsquo;s in some sort of mad dash</p>
<p>to secure some bag, by any means necessary.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no focus on the customers and the product and the team.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s, you know, living in some just manic, you know, grab money grab, you know,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the middle of a paintball war, you know, you&rsquo;re trying to, you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to shoot the paintball gun and you&rsquo;re trying to hit people and it&rsquo;s a little bit crazy</p>
<p>on the field.</p>
<p>But, you know, as everyone kind of gets back to the locker room and they take their win,</p>
<p>you know, all humans ultimately are going to be driven by a desire to leave something</p>
<p>in the world to make an impact of some sort.</p>
<p>And at some point, all the folks who have made a ton of money in this cycle, there were</p>
<p>a lot of folks who made a ton of money in the last cycle, are kind of asking themselves,</p>
<p>you know, how do I leave an impact?</p>
<p>How do I make an impact in the world?</p>
<p>And I still have a skill set and I still have a capability to do so.</p>
<p>And so then there&rsquo;s this search for meaning and that&rsquo;s where you see kind of the climate</p>
<p>change and the healthcare and all these other kind of paths start to form for people.</p>
<p>I do think Web 3 also offers another path of opportunity for folks where they can kind</p>
<p>of rewrite the internet and think about how to reinvent the social model for humanity,</p>
<p>the economic model for humanity, the governance model for humanity, the communications model</p>
<p>for humanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Web 3 creates that kind of, you know, that visionary kind of platform opportunity</p>
<p>and folks are all kind of excited about what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>So, you know, once the dust settles a little bit and you put some money in your pocket</p>
<p>and you realize, you know, it&rsquo;s not going to change your life more than, you know, it</p>
<p>did last week and, you know, you want to make an impact and then folks kind of come back</p>
<p>and they start pursuing, you know, where impact will lie.</p>
<p>Sax, let&rsquo;s go to you.</p>
<p>Sax, what was Roboy talking about?</p>
<p>What were you guys talking about in this breakfast?</p>
<p>Keith and I just talked about how we&rsquo;re about to enter a very different kind of macro environment</p>
<p>for growth stocks and we don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s going to take, but there&rsquo;s no question</p>
<p>that multiples and valuations are going to come down.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of younger founders and investors who never lived through a bear market</p>
<p>or a down cycle and they&rsquo;re about to get a rude awakening.</p>
<p>So, look, I think it&rsquo;s a little different for us because we&rsquo;re all principals at our</p>
<p>firms.</p>
<p>And so, therefore, if we&rsquo;re not happy about something, we could simply effectuate a change</p>
<p>in strategy.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re one of 20 partners at a giant firm, even if you&rsquo;re the most successful one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for you to move that ship.</p>
<p>And, you know, your returns get divided by, you know, it&rsquo;s one over N where N is the number</p>
<p>of like full partner shares.</p>
<p>And, you know, if you just made a ton of money over the last 10 years and you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about whether you want to sign up for going through a bunch of choppy waters, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of good reasons right now for people to reevaluate.</p>
<p>Now, look, Keith and I were both discussing this in the context of, hey, this would be</p>
<p>great for us because we&rsquo;re not going anywhere.</p>
<p>But Keith did think that because the macro picture is changing, that is one more reason</p>
<p>for people who are on the fence and thinking about retiring to move forward with that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ve talked about capital allocation, and we got the variant, and we got the markets.</p>
<p>Can I just point out how like, Zach, it seems like you and JCal and everyone are kind of</p>
<p>in Miami at Art Basel, and this thing&rsquo;s been going on for years, and it&rsquo;s an art fair.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like tech has taken it over.</p>
<p>Like, the tech industry&hellip;</p>
<p>Basically, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, like the tech community seems to have this kind of consistent trend of going to</p>
<p>these like esoteric, kind of call it originally artistically created events and spaces.</p>
<p>It was like Sundance, and then it was Burning Man, and now it&rsquo;s like Miami Art Basel and</p>
<p>kind of like&hellip;</p>
<p>And ruining it.</p>
<p>Ruining it, taking it for themselves.</p>
<p>You know, hey, now it&rsquo;s Tech Week in Miami, but it was like Art Basel has been going on</p>
<p>for forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s NFT Basel, they&rsquo;re calling it.</p>
<p>NFT Basel, yeah.</p>
<p>Brutal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally&hellip;</p>
<p>I feel bad for all the real creatives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the ugly Americans who come in and ruin the artisanal, you know, feel of the place</p>
<p>and flood the place with cash.</p>
<p>But look, no.</p>
<p>One difference between Florida or Miami in particular and California and San Francisco</p>
<p>in particular is nobody hates money or success over here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re happy for, you know, all these rich people to come in and spend their money.</p>
<p>They really believe in capitalism over here.</p>
<p>huge Cuban immigrant population who had direct experience with socialism and Argentinians</p>
<p>and people from South America.</p>
<p>And I mean, they teach their kids in schools the evils of socialism.</p>
<p>So yeah, nobody here is looking to purge the rich.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, Sax, because the Bay Area has a huge South Asian population, right?</p>
<p>And a huge immigrant population.</p>
<p>Why is that not the case in California, right?</p>
<p>Why is this huge immigrant population, whether they come from South America, Latin America,</p>
<p>or they come from South Asia, India, China?</p>
<p>Do we not have the same sort of response here for, you know, pushback against socialist</p>
<p>tendencies and the push for capitalism and entrepreneurism?</p>
<p>The big difference in South Florida is that those immigrant communities were politically</p>
<p>active and got really ingrained in the political process.</p>
<p>And so they were a loud voice, you know.</p>
<p>Systemically, what happens in South Asian families is we just don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a thing.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you look inside of our countries, the politicians are just the absolute sketchiest,</p>
<p>most brutal folks.</p>
<p>And so, you know, when you have people that got double E degrees from IIT, the last thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re thinking is like, I want to run for mayor of Santa Clara.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a big cultural distinction between the Chinese and South Asian populations versus</p>
<p>the South American population.</p>
<p>I have to say, San Francisco has become truly dystopian.</p>
<p>I went to San Francisco to see a comedy show, Hasan Minhaj, who is a big fan of This Pod.</p>
<p>He has an incredible show, by the way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And he did a show about MBS and him getting into it with The Kingdom and Patriot Act,</p>
<p>his show.</p>
<p>It was one of the most powerful, like, one-man shows I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>It kind of transcends comedy.</p>
<p>But I took Sonny, our friend Sonny, and we had a great time.</p>
<p>We walked through Union Square, because we wanted to get like a drink.</p>
<p>We walked through Union Square, and it was cordoned off with cop cars at every intersection,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no cars in the street.</p>
<p>And I was like, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Is there some police activity?</p>
<p>And I was like, they&rsquo;re like, no, the Louis Vuitton store got knocked off.</p>
<p>I kid you not, every single store has had every single window boarded up like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hurricane season.</p>
<p>But they all did them in pitch black.</p>
<p>So it must have been like one vendor came and did this for every vendor.</p>
<p>But like Zara, The Gap, Nike, every single storefront has been boarded up.</p>
<p>And then there are security guards outside, and you have to make an appointment to go</p>
<p>Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>And literally, they have road blockades of multiple cars at every intersection, because</p>
<p>these smash and grabs have become so brazen and dangerous.</p>
<p>There were 30 or 40 people involved in that one at the Louis Vuitton store.</p>
<p>Can you imagine you&rsquo;re shopping for Christmas and 40 people run through the windows?</p>
<p>This is the logical result of everything I&rsquo;ve been warning about since the beginning of</p>
<p>the year.</p>
<p>You have prosecutors like Chaser Boudin, who have essentially decriminalized theft by refusing</p>
<p>to prosecute it.</p>
<p>After the Louis Vuitton looting, he comes out there and says, well, don&rsquo;t bring this</p>
<p>noise from out of town.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he calls crime is noise.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s trying to pretend like it didn&rsquo;t arise in San Francisco, like somehow it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>come from out of town.</p>
<p>No, you created it by refusing to prosecute these types of crimes.</p>
<p>And then after talking tough, the first thing he did, he already released.</p>
<p>The police actually caught some of these looters of the LVMH.</p>
<p>He has already released them on zero bail.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The prison, the jail is a revolving door.</p>
<p>They have zero bail.</p>
<p>And so the people who did this are already out on bail.</p>
<p>Chaser talks tough when he charges them, but the charges are never actually brought.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re put down, thrown out, and it is dystopian.</p>
<p>And we couldn&rsquo;t find a place to have a drink.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find a single bar.</p>
<p>We just wanted to have like a post comedy show drink.</p>
<p>And by the way, Hassan&rsquo;s a huge fan of the pod.</p>
<p>We talked for an hour of the show.</p>
<p>He brought us backstage.</p>
<p>It was a really, really class act.</p>
<p>And we should have him on the pod at some point.</p>
<p>Do we want to talk about Jack leaving Twitter?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a segue here.</p>
<p>I mean, Chamath mentioned that you have these immigrant minorities from South Asia, I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>say Indian Americans, Chinese Americans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been spectacularly successful in the United States.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t been as politically active as, say, the Cuban Americans or Argentinian Americans</p>
<p>in Florida, but they&rsquo;ve been incredibly successful.</p>
<p>You had another example of that this week with Jack leaving Twitter.</p>
<p>His replacement is Parag Agarwal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an Indian American.</p>
<p>So you now have, you know, Indian immigrants, I guess, first or second generation running</p>
<p>Google with Sundar, Sasha Nadella at Microsoft, the CEO of Adobe, Shantanu Narayan, the CEOs</p>
<p>of MasterCard, Nokia, NAPA and IBM, all Indian Americans.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no question that people of color can be spectacularly successful in the United States.</p>
<p>And I think those communities are&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mess with the Browns.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Those communities are so busy availing themselves of the abundant opportunities for success</p>
<p>in this country that they haven&rsquo;t been basically involved in politics because they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been complaining about anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just been succeeding.</p>
<p>Too busy winning.</p>
<p>Too busy winning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a viral joke.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a CEO in Silicon Valley, you live long enough to see yourself replaced by an</p>
<p>Indian CEO.</p>
<p>That trended.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Look, Satya, Sundar, there&rsquo;s like four or five other examples, but it&rsquo;s now just absolutely</p>
<p>a great triumph.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing for our society that a lot of people who are immigrants or sons of immigrants</p>
<p>come here and run the largest, most dynamic, important companies in the world.</p>
<p>This is an incredible win.</p>
<p>And we have to reboot immigration in this country.</p>
<p>I believe in this very strongly that we need to get more intelligent people here.</p>
<p>And if you come here for your degree, we need to staple a green card to your degree when</p>
<p>you come up and pick it up on stage at Stanford or Harvard or whatever, community college,</p>
<p>you should stay here and build companies here.</p>
<p>We have to really open that up.</p>
<p>That was one of the huge failings of the Trump presidency and now going into Biden, who doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to care about immigration either.</p>
<p>Both of these people, it&rsquo;s huge fails.</p>
<p>Both parties do not want to bring intelligent people here.</p>
<p>I want to talk about Mike Bloomberg&rsquo;s $750 million donation.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll end on.</p>
<p>Explain to people what happened.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s given 750 to charter schools.</p>
<p>Am I correct?</p>
<p>First of all, Mike&rsquo;s a boss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known him for 15 years.</p>
<p>The best.</p>
<p>He is the best.</p>
<p>He is an absolute stone cold boss.</p>
<p>Killer.</p>
<p>Before I tell this story of what he did, you know, Mike was the largest donor to Johns</p>
<p>Hopkins.</p>
<p>And for years, he would donate without any fanfare.</p>
<p>And this is something that I&rsquo;ve actually copied from him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given money to my alma mater, not anywhere near the same amount as he has.</p>
<p>But, you know, after he passed a billion dollars of donations, he made it public.</p>
<p>And he was able to make Johns Hopkins permanently need blind.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of like Johns Hopkins became this bastion to attract the smartest kids</p>
<p>period bar none.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And everybody gets and everybody gets their their way paid basically.</p>
<p>So he announced a program 750 million dollars over the next four or five years, I think</p>
<p>to get 150,000 kids, Jason, tell me if I got this wrong, into charter schools all around</p>
<p>the country.</p>
<p>And he basically just talked about how, you know, the pandemic is really let our kids</p>
<p>down in every single way possible.</p>
<p>And he had these quotes from the leader of the California Teachers Union.</p>
<p>And it was so odious, the things that she said, and the biggest quote was basically</p>
<p>like, you can recall Gavin Newsom, and you can recall the mayor of a city, but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recall me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to do what I want.</p>
<p>And it was it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>It was disgusting, actually.</p>
<p>Man, I wish he had won for president.</p>
<p>Number one issue I Glenn Young can one in Virginia was that was schools.</p>
<p>It was the fact that you had these school lockdowns and closures.</p>
<p>And then also, the parents weren&rsquo;t happy with what&rsquo;s being taught in the schools.</p>
<p>And the unions and the politicians are beholden to them are completely arrogant about this</p>
<p>and explicitly say to the parents, you don&rsquo;t get to decide what you&rsquo;re by the way, arrogant</p>
<p>is the right word.</p>
<p>David, if you read these quotes in the Wall Street Journal article, it&rsquo;s disgusting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting the way this woman talks about our kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really disgusting.</p>
<p>And, well, it takes a rare democrat like Bloomberg to basically stand up to them.</p>
<p>I mean, Biden certainly doesn&rsquo;t because they are the number one specialist Democratic Party</p>
<p>in terms of the manpower and boots in the ground and donations.</p>
<p>You will never hear a politician like Gavin Newsom ever stand up to them because he wants</p>
<p>to be president.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to basically he doesn&rsquo;t want to cross any major interest of the Democratic</p>
<p>Party.</p>
<p>It takes an outsider like Bloomberg to understand how they were able to sell so effectively</p>
<p>anti choice for parents and schools like everybody in the world.</p>
<p>100% of people in America know that choice and competition equals better outcomes, better</p>
<p>products.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not up for debate.</p>
<p>And somehow they were able to flip people&rsquo;s thinking that no, no competition in schools</p>
<p>was more equitable and that created more equity in the world.</p>
<p>How did they do that?</p>
<p>Or how did they pull this off?</p>
<p>They just paid everybody off.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They never gave parents a choice because parents didn&rsquo;t know a choice was possible.</p>
<p>We took a system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>How did we dilute people into thinking?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, they didn&rsquo;t have to dilute people.</p>
<p>They just had to basically use their money to pay off a small cohort of individuals to</p>
<p>basically back their own view.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of her quotes if you want to read them.</p>
<p>Number one, there&rsquo;s no such thing as learning loss because Mike Mike was basically saying</p>
<p>that you know, these kids have stopped learning and there&rsquo;s a huge learning.</p>
<p>She said there&rsquo;s no such thing as learning loss.</p>
<p>She said in an interview with LA magazine, our kids didn&rsquo;t lose anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay that hold on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay that our babies may not have learned their times tables.</p>
<p>They learned resilience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s honestly, that&rsquo;s a crock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crock of who is this person?</p>
<p>And how do we get her out of office?</p>
<p>And what is she like?</p>
<p>But but the money the money quote was this one.</p>
<p>You can recall the governor.</p>
<p>You can recall the school board.</p>
<p>But how are you going to recall me?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really come on fate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Saks do you have a purple pack?</p>
<p>This is Cecily Cecily my art cruise, the head of the Los Angeles teachers.</p>
<p>Somebody start recall Cecily.org will recall all of them.</p>
<p>I think this recalling trend is brilliant.</p>
<p>Like if people are absolutely not doing their job.</p>
<p>Yes, recall them.</p>
<p>She should be allowed obviously to be a great representative for LA school teachers and</p>
<p>fight on their behalf.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what unions and union leaders are supposed to do.</p>
<p>But something tells me between that goal and how she expressed herself here.</p>
<p>Something has happened and that&rsquo;s corrupted her go to market, if you will, that I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really scary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a town.</p>
<p>She has an arrogance there in those quotes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just obvious.</p>
<p>Look, the thing about these policies, progressive policies is they hurt the communities that</p>
<p>they that they pretend to be speaking for the most.</p>
<p>And so who is hurt by learning loss the most it&rsquo;s disadvantaged kids who can&rsquo;t afford</p>
<p>private tutors.</p>
<p>The exact same thing is true of defund the police and this decarceration and deprosecution.</p>
<p>The communities that get hit the hardest are the ones that are exposed to the most crime.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically the most deprived areas.</p>
<p>The rich people can hire private security, have high walls, live in gated communities.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re seeing over and over again.</p>
<p>This is why Eric Adams, who basically is a pro police guy in New York City, got huge</p>
<p>percentages of the votes of minority communities in places like the Bronx.</p>
<p>And Glenn Youngkin did extremely well in Virginia with minority communities.</p>
<p>So, you know, these and they tend to be primarily white progressives like Jason Boudin, like</p>
<p>Georgia Gascogne, like Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the craziest ones.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the craziest ones.</p>
<p>They are deranged.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>They are so deranged.</p>
<p>These are these are luxury beliefs that they that they&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Virtue signaling is so just a luxury, luxury beliefs.</p>
<p>Speaking of crazy progressive, we just go back to the Twitter thing for a second, because</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a little bit more to say there about Jack Dorsey stepping down, because I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a real fear on the part of a lot of people that Twitter now is going to</p>
<p>slide into even greater censorship like YouTube has, because now you have a CEO who, you know,</p>
<p>Perag, who said last year in 2020, there&rsquo;s an article where he basically said that Twitter</p>
<p>does not need to follow the principles of the First Amendment as content moderation</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>So here you have a company.</p>
<p>I mean, you just look at the bookends of Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s reign as CEO, and it&rsquo;s really a sharp</p>
<p>contrast.</p>
<p>You had when Dick Costello was CEO 10 years ago, he said, we are the free speech wing</p>
<p>of the free speech party.</p>
<p>And now to Perag is CEO Dorsey&rsquo;s handpicked successor 10 or 11 years later, basically</p>
<p>saying that the First Amendment does not matter.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to follow it when it comes to their content moderation.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s been a real sea change over there and how they view their mission.</p>
<p>They used to be in favor of free speech.</p>
<p>They used to think that what they&rsquo;re doing was democratizing.</p>
<p>Now they basically are pushing this agenda of censorship.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen it, censorship of really any opinion that violates the elite consensus, like on</p>
<p>COVID, like on many of these issues.</p>
<p>It could be simpler, David.</p>
<p>It could just be that it&rsquo;s just really hard to run these things at scale.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re all just saying, you know what, it&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to run it anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that hard.</p>
<p>I mean, so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So Mike Solana had a column where he&rsquo;s basically arguing that Jack Dorsey was really a secret</p>
<p>defender of the First Amendment and the censorship would be even worse or will be once he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I agree that it was.</p>
<p>Well, let me let me tell you the part I disagree with.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Things are only going to get worse once he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Well, no, I know he is for freedom of speech.</p>
<p>He just didn&rsquo;t like to have to deal with the government and all these issues.</p>
<p>Like, I think it just became untenable because of the scale.</p>
<p>But he is a free speech guy.</p>
<p>But the one thing with Larry Page.</p>
<p>Same with Larry Page, yes.</p>
<p>This is on a personal basis.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>Edmund Burke had a great quote saying that all that is necessary for evil to triumph</p>
<p>is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey may be a good man, but he did nothing or very little to stop this agenda</p>
<p>of censorship.</p>
<p>When they came to him and said they&rsquo;re going to de-platform a sitting president of the</p>
<p>United States, all he had to say was no, no.</p>
<p>He had the veto power and he didn&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>Listen, he left.</p>
<p>I mean, I hate to get into politics here because people hate this part of the show, but he</p>
<p>let he specifically believe that Trump should stay on the platform because he was president</p>
<p>and he stood up to people for four years who told them, get president off.</p>
<p>Like everybody was screaming, Trump shouldn&rsquo;t be on here.</p>
<p>And he said, no, he&rsquo;s the president.</p>
<p>He should be on that.</p>
<p>That was his position.</p>
<p>It was January 6th that he took him off.</p>
<p>All these guys, Larry, Larry and Sergey, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>They are all fundamentally free speech people.</p>
<p>They believe in the power of the open Internet.</p>
<p>I remember in the early days at Google, the intention and the motivation behind the mission</p>
<p>of Google was the democratization of access to information.</p>
<p>By creating access to information and making all information, all points of view, all data</p>
<p>available, they believed that democracy would flourish around the world and that would enable</p>
<p>these things that would allow these societies that were limited in information, access information</p>
<p>to flourish and transform themselves.</p>
<p>And I think the challenge arises when the political motivation where someone&rsquo;s voice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being spoken is viewed and deemed to be harmful or viewed and deemed to be inflammatory</p>
<p>or viewed and deemed to be too violence inducing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the push comes to shove in these kind of governance decisions that these</p>
<p>folks end up having to make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an easy position.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, philosophically, I think that everyone that&rsquo;s involved in the Internet,</p>
<p>all technologists, they all have the same intention and motivation and point of view.</p>
<p>But it is so frigging hard to navigate what ends up happening.</p>
<p>And by the way, look at what happened to 4chan.</p>
<p>4chan was supposed to be this open, no one&rsquo;s going to touch it.</p>
<p>And then there were pictures of like people being murdered and raped and all this other</p>
<p>sort of terrible stuff that emerged on 4chan.</p>
<p>And same at Reddit, right?</p>
<p>Remember the whole controversy around Reddit needing to clamp down?</p>
<p>And Ellen and others got a lot of heat for clamping down on the free speech, quote unquote,</p>
<p>of what was going on on Reddit.</p>
<p>Revenge porn.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a line.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a line.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>Your point of view on what the line should be and someone else&rsquo;s point of view on what</p>
<p>the line should be is a difference of opinion.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, opinions are going to drive&hellip;</p>
<p>And yours, David, is based on your guy getting banned.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear here.</p>
<p>If your guy hadn&rsquo;t been banned, that&rsquo;s the tip of your spear.</p>
<p>No, I think, quite frankly, I think the fact that he&rsquo;s off Twitter, I think is frankly</p>
<p>great for my team, if you want to call it that, because&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh boy, here we go.</p>
<p>Here it comes.</p>
<p>Here it comes.</p>
<p>No, I mean, look&hellip;</p>
<p>Download the Colin app at App Store right now.</p>
<p>Colin app is available on Android.</p>
<p>Do a Google Play and I&rsquo;m going to call it app.</p>
<p>No, let me respond.</p>
<p>Let me respond to it.</p>
<p>Shemoth, are you eating rice?</p>
<p>Is Shemoth eating rice right now?</p>
<p>I had an incredible barley salad.</p>
<p>Okay, no, let&rsquo;s back off.</p>
<p>And then a little brezzino.</p>
<p>I want to respond to what Freeberg said.</p>
<p>Okay, so Freeberg is exactly&hellip;</p>
<p>Closing argument.</p>
<p>Closing argument is this.</p>
<p>Freeberg is exactly right about where the internet stood 10 years ago.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that Zuck and Page and Dorsey all believed in the open internet.</p>
<p>They believed in the democratizing power of the internet.</p>
<p>When the Green Revolution happened in 2009, everybody was cheering.</p>
<p>So what changed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what changed.</p>
<p>In 2016, they got a candidate elected who they didn&rsquo;t like, and their principles</p>
<p>were so skin deep, basically so superficial, that they completely flipped</p>
<p>because they got one election where there was a result they didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And so they turned against democracy.</p>
<p>Look, Twitter and democracy worked in 2016.</p>
<p>The establishment lost because they had supported two decades of futile wars</p>
<p>in the Middle East, trade policy with China that hollowed out jobs,</p>
<p>border policy that didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>The American people sent the establishment a message in 2016.</p>
<p>The establishment should have taken the note, okay, but they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Instead, what they did is blame social media for disinformation,</p>
<p>Russian collusion, hate speech, white supremacy, what have you.</p>
<p>And since then, they&rsquo;ve been on a mission to ban those things</p>
<p>from their social networks.</p>
<p>It is a total myth, okay?</p>
<p>The reason why Trump won the election in 2016 is because of the issues he ran on.</p>
<p>The establishment should have taken the note.</p>
<p>Instead, they&rsquo;ve been on this wild goose chase attacking disinformation.</p>
<p>Hey, Nick, Nick, can you just edit out that last part of David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anybody to hear it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, we get to vote.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s vote David&rsquo;s Trump rant on the episode.</p>
<p>Take that out, Nick.</p>
<p>Please just bleep it out.</p>
<p>No, he never said anything.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think the biggest winner here is going to be TikTok?</p>
<p>Because if Twitter does go forward with the standing,</p>
<p>if they say, look, you can&rsquo;t put user-generated content on our platform</p>
<p>if it has video and images of people without their consent and approval,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to eliminate all of this democratization of access to video feeds</p>
<p>of riots and crime and all sorts of things that have been a real big boon.</p>
<p>So TikTok&rsquo;s not going to do that.</p>
<p>TikTok&rsquo;s going to end up soaking up this whole market, right?</p>
<p>For user-generated content.</p>
<p>Just so everybody knows what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>The day after Jack left, they said there&rsquo;s going to be a new safety and security.</p>
<p>Again, if you feel unsafe, that&rsquo;s when you get that little,</p>
<p>your antenna should go up.</p>
<p>So if you feel unsafe because somebody posted a picture of you,</p>
<p>even if you were in a public space, which is completely valid,</p>
<p>you can take a picture of anybody in a public space that if you didn&rsquo;t consent</p>
<p>and you feel unsafe, then you can have it taken down.</p>
<p>And this has led to people thinking like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t take a picture at a Warriors game of people in the background</p>
<p>without getting the 20 people in the row to consent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a backstop, I think,</p>
<p>but it is definitely a very bizarre position to take that people in public</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have their picture taken because that is a just canonical example</p>
<p>of freedom of speech and you don&rsquo;t have a right to privacy if you&rsquo;re out in public.</p>
<p>So it kind of falls into your category, David.</p>
<p>The policy doesn&rsquo;t make, the policy doesn&rsquo;t even make any sense.</p>
<p>Nobody even understands it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s illogical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very poorly rolled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s illogical.</p>
<p>Look, you could have set a policy of, listen,</p>
<p>if you have a non-public person being harassed,</p>
<p>you can always take down basically unauthorized footage of that person.</p>
<p>It could have been a harassment policy.</p>
<p>Instead, they just banned all public video footage.</p>
<p>And you know it&rsquo;s going to be applied selectively.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my problem with this disinformation argument, okay,</p>
<p>is where are the warning labels or the banning of tweets basically describing</p>
<p>Kyle Rittenhouse as a white supremacist across straight lines with an AR-15?</p>
<p>That is not true, okay?</p>
<p>But that message went viral on Twitter.</p>
<p>The Steele dossier went viral on Twitter, and yet there are no warning.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>There are no warning labels to this day,</p>
<p>despite the fact that that&rsquo;s been completely debunked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to defend any specific politician in particular, Jason.</p>
<p>I know you think this is all about Trump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the double standard, okay?</p>
<p>These censorship principles only exist so the employees of the company can</p>
<p>censor one side of the debate they don&rsquo;t agree with.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to admit that there is a ton of bias and one-sidedness in the way</p>
<p>these principles are enforced.</p>
<p>I agree there&rsquo;s bias.</p>
<p>I agree that these companies are 70, 80% Democrat, and I agree they all have</p>
<p>significant issues around Trump derangement syndrome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to go.</p>
<p>Chamath has had to leave the building.</p>
<p>He had to go on to his next meeting for the dictator, the queen of quinoa,</p>
<p>the sultan of science, and the Raymond David Sachs,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;m going to go get a Cuban sandwich with right now that we&rsquo;re both going</p>
<p>to look at and poke around and take two bites of so we can say,</p>
<p>My guy, the Raymond David Sachs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Raymond David Sachs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>We open-sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>I love you, Wesley.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
