    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Sachin Panda.</p>
<p>Dr. Sachin Panda is a professor</p>
<p>and director of the Regulatory Biology Laboratory</p>
<p>at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies.</p>
<p>His laboratory has made numerous important contributions</p>
<p>that impact mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and human performance.</p>
<p>For instance, his laboratory discovered</p>
<p>the neurons in the eye and neurons within the brain</p>
<p>that regulate our so-called circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Circadian rhythms are 24-hour rhythms</p>
<p>in everything from gene expression</p>
<p>to the overall functioning of tissues,</p>
<p>our levels of mood and alertness,</p>
<p>our ability to sleep, appetite, and much, much more.</p>
<p>In addition, over the last decade,</p>
<p>Dr. Panda&rsquo;s laboratory has made critical discoveries</p>
<p>in terms of how our patterns of eating over time</p>
<p>impact our biology and our health.</p>
<p>In particular, his laboratory pioneered discoveries</p>
<p>related to so-called intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>also sometimes referred to as time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Panda and I discuss how our circadian behaviors,</p>
<p>everything from when we wake up to when we view light</p>
<p>to when we avoid viewing light</p>
<p>to when we eat and what we eat</p>
<p>and when we socialize and how we socialize</p>
<p>impacts our biology and our psychology</p>
<p>and how all of that has a strong impact on our health.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you will learn how restricting your feeding</p>
<p>to specific periods within each 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>or perhaps even exploring longer patterns</p>
<p>of fasting and eating cycles</p>
<p>can impact everything from the health of your liver</p>
<p>to your gut, to your brain,</p>
<p>and how all of that impacts things like mood</p>
<p>and your ability to perform cognitive work.</p>
<p>Indeed, today&rsquo;s discussion goes deep</p>
<p>into all aspects of intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>aka time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>We talk about the basic science</p>
<p>as well as the recent clinical trials</p>
<p>that have explored time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>in a diverse range of people,</p>
<p>including men, women, children, people with diabetes,</p>
<p>people who are otherwise healthy, and much, much more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite aware that intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is a topic of much debate these days.</p>
<p>We go deep into that debate</p>
<p>and by the end of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you can be certain that you will have learned</p>
<p>all the latest and all the details,</p>
<p>all made very clear to you</p>
<p>thanks to the incredible expertise, discovery,</p>
<p>and clear communication of Dr. Panda.</p>
<p>As some of you may already know,</p>
<p>Dr. Panda has authored several important books</p>
<p>on the topic of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and how it can benefit various aspects of health.</p>
<p>Those books include The Circadian Code</p>
<p>and a more recent book, The Circadian Diabetes Code,</p>
<p>both of which we&rsquo;ve provided links to</p>
<p>in the show note captions.</p>
<p>In addition, if any of you are interested</p>
<p>in learning more about Dr. Panda&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>including seeing his publications</p>
<p>and reading those publications</p>
<p>or supporting his laboratory,</p>
<p>you can do that by going to his laboratory website,</p>
<p>which we have also linked in the show note captions.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is HVMN Ketone IQ.</p>
<p>HVMN Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones.</p>
<p>I want to be clear that I am not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Most people fall into this category.</p>
<p>They are not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>They are omnivores and they do eat carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So their standard fuel source for the brain and body</p>
<p>is not ketones.</p>
<p>However, I found that by taking Ketone IQ,</p>
<p>which we know increases blood ketones,</p>
<p>I can achieve much better focus</p>
<p>for longer periods of time for any kind of cognitive work</p>
<p>and much greater energy levels for exercise,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;m going into that exercise fasted</p>
<p>and find myself a little bit hungry</p>
<p>when I start that exercise.</p>
<p>And this is no surprise.</p>
<p>We know that ketones are the brain&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and body&rsquo;s preferred fuel source,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>So in other words, I and many other people</p>
<p>are now starting to leverage endogenous ketones</p>
<p>as a fuel source for the brain and body,</p>
<p>and yet we are not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>And of course, if you are following a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>Ketone IQ will further allow you</p>
<p>to increase your blood ketones</p>
<p>as a source of brain and body fuel.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by 8Sleep.</p>
<p>8Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve talked about before on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>there is a critical relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and body temperature.</p>
<p>That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,</p>
<p>your body temperature needs to drop</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>And in order to wake up in the morning and feel alert,</p>
<p>your body temperature needs to increase</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>The problem with most people&rsquo;s sleeping environment</p>
<p>is that even if you make the room cool,</p>
<p>the actual environment that you sleep on,</p>
<p>that is your mattress and underneath your covers,</p>
<p>is hard to regulate in terms of temperature.</p>
<p>With 8Sleep, regulating the temperature</p>
<p>of that sleeping environment becomes incredibly easy.</p>
<p>In fact, you can change the temperature</p>
<p>of that environment across the night,</p>
<p>making it a little bit cool at the beginning of the night,</p>
<p>even cooler still a few hours into your sleep,</p>
<p>which really helps getting into very deep sleep,</p>
<p>and then warming it as you approach morning</p>
<p>so that you wake up feeling most alert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>for over a year now,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try 8Sleep,</p>
<p>you can go to 8Sleep.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to save up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover.</p>
<p>8Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,</p>
<p>select countries in the EU, and Australia.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s 8Sleep.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes custom nootropics.</p>
<p>Now, I am not a fan of the word nootropics</p>
<p>because it translates to smart drugs.</p>
<p>And as a neuroscientist, what I can tell you</p>
<p>is that you have circuits in your brain</p>
<p>that allow you to focus.</p>
<p>You have circuits in your brain</p>
<p>that allow you to be creative.</p>
<p>You have circuits in your brain</p>
<p>that allow you to task switch and on and on.</p>
<p>In other words, there is no specific brain circuit</p>
<p>or even circuits for being quote-unquote smart.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this and has developed nootropics</p>
<p>that are customized to different types</p>
<p>of mental operations.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, they have formulas that can put your brain</p>
<p>into a state of increased clarity or focus or creativity,</p>
<p>or that can give you more overall energy</p>
<p>for things like physical exercise.</p>
<p>I often take the thesis clarity formula</p>
<p>prior to long bouts of cognitive work,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula</p>
<p>prior to doing any kind of really intense physical exercise.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try</p>
<p>your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take a brief three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman.</p>

<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>To find the supplements we discuss</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that the library</p>
<p>of those supplements is constantly expanding.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Sachin Panda.</p>
<p>Sachin, Dr. Panda, so good to see you again.</p>
<p>Yeah, good to see you.</p>
<p>We are colleagues still,</p>
<p>but we used to be right across the street</p>
<p>from one another in San Diego.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember those days.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m delighted that you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to talk about a number of things,</p>
<p>mainly intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding and health,</p>
<p>but also the many other things that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Just before we started recording,</p>
<p>we were discussing your recent paper in Nature</p>
<p>that involved recordings from post-mortem human retina.</p>
<p>So maybe if there&rsquo;s time at the end, we can get back to.</p>
<p>Your lab has shown that it can essentially maintain</p>
<p>or resurrect neurons from dead people</p>
<p>in order to potentially and eventually provide transplants</p>
<p>to rescue vision in the blind.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s extremely exciting,</p>
<p>but of course not the main focus of today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to split it up.</p>
<p>The first question I have is how am I supposed to define</p>
<p>fasting and time-restricted feeding?</p>
<p>Meaning when I go to sleep every night, I&rsquo;m not eating.</p>
<p>So in some sense, everybody is doing time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>to some degree or another.</p>
<p>At what point can we start thinking about a pattern</p>
<p>of eating as time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>so-called intermittent fasting?</p>
<p>Does it have to do with how regular one is</p>
<p>about the start and stop times?</p>
<p>How do you think about defining intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>and maybe just to simplify the conversation,</p>
<p>is one term more correct than the other</p>
<p>in terms of describing this incredible pattern of feeding?</p>
<p>Well, you know that intermittent fasting</p>
<p>covers many types of fasting.</p>
<p>Actually, it started a long time ago</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s embedded into the history of caloric restriction.</p>
<p>Almost a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>people showed that if you reduce calorie intake in a rat,</p>
<p>then that rat can live for a long time.</p>
<p>And in those experiments,</p>
<p>the calories were reduced every single day.</p>
<p>And that led to the idea</p>
<p>that if we cut down our calories by 20%, say,</p>
<p>then we can potentially live longer by doing two things.</p>
<p>One is preventing AIDS-related disease,</p>
<p>or even if we fall sick, maybe we can accelerate cure</p>
<p>and keep the repair mechanism going</p>
<p>so that we can live longer.</p>
<p>But it was very difficult to count calories every day</p>
<p>and reduce, maintain that.</p>
<p>I must say that it&rsquo;s not that caloric restriction</p>
<p>is impossible or we are not doing it.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of us,</p>
<p>we do count calories in our subconscious mind.</p>
<p>And so every time we take out a soda bottle or something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at, okay, 160 kilocalories,</p>
<p>30 kilocalories, zero kilocalories.</p>
<p>We are doing that.</p>
<p>So the point is we are doing subconsciously</p>
<p>some kind of calorie counting,</p>
<p>but reducing calorie by 20, 30% every single day</p>
<p>is not possible for many people.</p>
<p>So then the idea came in mouse and rat experiment</p>
<p>whether they can eat every other day.</p>
<p>And in fact, this every other day feeding</p>
<p>also led to very similar,</p>
<p>almost equivalent health improvement</p>
<p>as continuous calorie restriction.</p>
<p>So then the idea was, well,</p>
<p>every other day is a little bit hard for humans,</p>
<p>but just imagine I would just get to eat</p>
<p>only one day and then another day.</p>
<p>Then the idea came, well, for humans,</p>
<p>can they eat less for one or two days in the week?</p>
<p>So that led to this 5-2 diet</p>
<p>where people can eat for five days</p>
<p>and then two days they have to reduce calories.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also intermittently people are fasting.</p>
<p>Then as you know, Walter Longo also came with this idea</p>
<p>that period fasting, maybe four or five days</p>
<p>in every month or two months, three months,</p>
<p>you can fast or reduce calorie.</p>
<p>And he also found many benefits</p>
<p>of calorie restriction was there.</p>
<p>Were those studies on humans?</p>
<p>Many of the studies started in mice,</p>
<p>but alternate day fasting, 5-2,</p>
<p>and Walter&rsquo;s period fasting,</p>
<p>all of them have now been done in humans.</p>
<p>Not for longevity, of course,</p>
<p>because you cannot do those for a long time,</p>
<p>but for weight maintenance,</p>
<p>for reducing some signs of aging or reversing,</p>
<p>those things have been done.</p>
<p>So all of them have been done in humans,</p>
<p>mostly healthy humans.</p>
<p>And in some cases, people with prediabetes</p>
<p>or some aspects of metabolic disease.</p>
<p>So that led to the idea that all these forms of fasting</p>
<p>in which the total caloric intake on any given day</p>
<p>is reduced for one or more days in a week, a month,</p>
<p>that became, that umbrella term became intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>So if you look up the scientific literature,</p>
<p>most intermittent fasting involves</p>
<p>intentionally reducing calories</p>
<p>for at least one or two days in a week,</p>
<p>or a few days in a month.</p>
<p>So when we publish time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>the initial mouse experiments,</p>
<p>and even now, most of the mouse experiments,</p>
<p>we want to test what is the impact of time restriction</p>
<p>versus calorie restriction.</p>
<p>So in these experiments,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t reduce calorie on any day of mouse life.</p>
<p>So the mice eat the same number of calories</p>
<p>as the ad libitum fed mice,</p>
<p>but still they see health benefit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we call it time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>But since it involves living without food for several hours,</p>
<p>for some people, which is, it can be very difficult.</p>
<p>The initial experiments was done,</p>
<p>they were done for eight hours of feeding</p>
<p>and 16 hours of fasting.</p>
<p>That kind of became popular.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why people use the same term</p>
<p>as intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>And now if you say intermittent fasting</p>
<p>in popular literature or popular media,</p>
<p>then people usually refer to time-restricted eating.</p>
<p>So now coming back to how do you define</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding?</p>
<p>So the way we have been trying to define experimentally</p>
<p>and also in literature is trying to</p>
<p>confine all your energy intake</p>
<p>from solid and liquid food combined</p>
<p>within a consistent window of eight to 12 hours,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s something that doable.</p>
<p>Of course, people have done time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>with four hours, six hours,</p>
<p>and some people even try to eat everything</p>
<p>within two hours, one meal a day.</p>
<p>But the point is those are not feasible</p>
<p>to maintain for very long time for a lot of people.</p>
<p>One question about the six hour versus eight hour</p>
<p>versus 12 hour feeding window.</p>
<p>Is it important that the feeding window</p>
<p>begin and end at the same time, more or less?</p>
<p>Yeah, more or less.</p>
<p>And if so, how much flexibility is there?</p>
<p>So for instance, I&rsquo;m somebody that</p>
<p>I am not terribly hungry in the morning.</p>
<p>I like to drink water, usually some caffeine</p>
<p>and electrolytes in the period before my first meal.</p>
<p>And my first meal always lands sometime</p>
<p>between 11 a.m. and 12 noon.</p>
<p>There are exceptions, occasionally I&rsquo;ll have a breakfast,</p>
<p>a proper breakfast as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>I guess it would be improper</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re intermittent fasting for me.</p>
<p>But typically 11 a.m. or noon is when I first eat.</p>
<p>And my last bite of food is typically around,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 8.30, 9 p.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what works for me.</p>
<p>Is that consistency affording me any benefit?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just leave aside total caloric number,</p>
<p>macronutrients, plant-based meat, et cetera.</p>
<p>But is there any benefit to shortening that feeding window</p>
<p>that we are aware of or extending that feeding window</p>
<p>or being even more rigid about the start</p>
<p>and end of that feeding window?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the start of the feeding window,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting because the concept of time-restricted</p>
<p>feeding, when I describe animal studies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s feeding for humans, it&rsquo;s eating.</p>
<p>So the concept actually came from</p>
<p>the science of circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>So that means our body has an internal timetable</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s present in every cell, in every organ</p>
<p>that pre-programs many molecular aspects of the cells</p>
<p>that leads to physiology and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So that essentially, there is a predetermined timetable</p>
<p>for every cell, every organ to do certain things</p>
<p>at certain time.</p>
<p>And the circadian clocks, as you and I know,</p>
<p>are more sensitive to light.</p>
<p>Light is the most dominant time-giver.</p>
<p>So for example, when daylight saving time changes</p>
<p>or when we travel from one time zone to another time zone,</p>
<p>we feel kind of crappy because our daily activities</p>
<p>are out of sync from our internal clock.</p>
<p>So that was known for a very long time,</p>
<p>but then around the year 2000, 2002,</p>
<p>there was a famous experiment by Uli Sibler</p>
<p>from Switzerland.</p>
<p>What he did, he just fed the mice at the wrong time.</p>
<p>Mice are nocturnal, they&rsquo;re night feeders.</p>
<p>And when he fed the mice during daytime,</p>
<p>the liver clock, instead of following its own routine,</p>
<p>liver clock actually started following food.</p>
<p>So that means by changing our feeding time,</p>
<p>we can change, we can tune our liver clock.</p>
<p>And subsequently, the same experiment</p>
<p>has been repeated many times.</p>
<p>And again, we repeated that in 2009.</p>
<p>And we figured out, yes, actually outside this brain center</p>
<p>called suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN,</p>
<p>which is considered the master circadian clock,</p>
<p>almost the rest of the brain even follows when we eat.</p>
<p>And that came out from Pierre Chambon&rsquo;s lab in Europe,</p>
<p>where they systematically looked at even places</p>
<p>that are very close to the SCN.</p>
<p>For those who know, those medial hypothalamus</p>
<p>or paraventricular nucleus, all of this,</p>
<p>within a couple of four or five millimeters of the SCN,</p>
<p>but they were following food cue.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So then, now if we think about it,</p>
<p>so for example, when the daylight seven time changes,</p>
<p>just one hour change,</p>
<p>or one hour change in alignment between our internal time</p>
<p>and external time leads to kind of feeling groggy</p>
<p>and feeling not at our peak performance</p>
<p>for one or two days.</p>
<p>So the rule of thumb is when the time giver</p>
<p>changes by one hour,</p>
<p>then our internal clock takes at least a day to catch up.</p>
<p>So that means if you&rsquo;re flying from LA to New York,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re moving through three time zones,</p>
<p>then on an average, it will take three days</p>
<p>to catch up with the New York time.</p>
<p>For some people, it can be even slower,</p>
<p>and for some people, it can be two days,</p>
<p>but the bottom line is, yes, there is a desynchrony.</p>
<p>So then, what does it mean for the body?</p>
<p>So one of the functions of the clock</p>
<p>is to anticipate when you&rsquo;re going to wake up,</p>
<p>for example, so the blood pressure slightly goes up,</p>
<p>our heart rate goes up, our breathing goes up.</p>
<p>Similarly, for food,</p>
<p>almost every organ that is involved in feeding</p>
<p>or eating, digestion, all of them have clocks.</p>
<p>So even from saliva production,</p>
<p>that is the first phase of digestion</p>
<p>to secretion of all the digestive juice in the stomach,</p>
<p>and then absorption of nutrient and liver metabolism,</p>
<p>everything, the whole village expects</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re supposed to eat,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting ready for you to eat the first meal</p>
<p>after fasting for a long time,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s breaking the fast or breakfast.</p>
<p>And when that time changes,</p>
<p>when you change it by two or three hours</p>
<p>from one day to another,</p>
<p>then sometimes they&rsquo;re like, oh, food didn&rsquo;t come,</p>
<p>or maybe we&rsquo;ll come at a wrong time,</p>
<p>we were at the wrong time,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll track the new eating times.</p>
<p>So suppose that one day,</p>
<p>you have been eating every day at 8 a.m.,</p>
<p>I eat at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Is that when you start your feeding window?</p>
<p>When does your feeding window shut?</p>
<p>6 p.m., so I eat for around 10 hours.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then one day, if I switch to 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>then what happens is a clock is thinking,</p>
<p>well, the food didn&rsquo;t arrive at 8, but it arrived at 10.</p>
<p>Maybe tomorrow the food will arrive</p>
<p>somewhere between 8 and 10,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll be ready around 9.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And next day, if I come back and eat at 8 o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>then I may eat, but my clock is not ready</p>
<p>to digest that food,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why this idea is you have to be consistent</p>
<p>to take advantage of this anticipatory activity</p>
<p>of our clock in different systems</p>
<p>to get the best out of it.</p>
<p>Is there evidence that those anticipatory systems,</p>
<p>as they relate to digestion,</p>
<p>help us better assimilate our food?</p>
<p>I would imagine so.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have the gastric juices</p>
<p>that are gonna help digest the proteins, fats,</p>
<p>and carbohydrates already deployed</p>
<p>at the time when you eat,</p>
<p>I could imagine that food will be better utilized</p>
<p>than if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So in other words, what is the advantage</p>
<p>of having these anticipatory signals</p>
<p>in terms of potential health benefits?</p>
<p>The anticipatory signal is really important</p>
<p>even from waking up.</p>
<p>The reason why many people feel not ready completely</p>
<p>when they wake up to an alarm clock,</p>
<p>because the alarm clock wakes you up,</p>
<p>but your body is not prepared,</p>
<p>so that sleepiness after waking up to an alarm clock</p>
<p>is due to our body is not prepared for that.</p>
<p>And then the best example is</p>
<p>when the daylight saving time changes,</p>
<p>particularly when we have to wake up one hour early,</p>
<p>what happens, people who have underlying heart condition,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re waking up when the body is not ready</p>
<p>or heart is not ready and all of a sudden</p>
<p>the heart has to start pumping a little bit harder,</p>
<p>there is chance of heart attack.</p>
<p>And in fact, people have looked at hospital records</p>
<p>and they find that on those days,</p>
<p>there is a sharp rise in heart attacks.</p>
<p>And car accidents.</p>
<p>And car accidents too,</p>
<p>because your brain is not coordinated,</p>
<p>so you cannot make those fine decisions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great example of anticipatory activity.</p>
<p>But coming back to digestion,</p>
<p>one thing is,</p>
<p>and this is something</p>
<p>that many people might have experienced.</p>
<p>There are many rhythms in our digestive system,</p>
<p>and one of the rhythms is our intestine</p>
<p>has this peristaltic function,</p>
<p>so it kind of contracts and expands,</p>
<p>and that moves food.</p>
<p>Food doesn&rsquo;t move due to gravity,</p>
<p>so it goes back and forth.</p>
<p>And that peristaltic action actually slows down at night,</p>
<p>a few hours after our last meal.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why when people eat late at night,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>then that food doesn&rsquo;t get digested</p>
<p>because there is not enough digestive juice, first thing.</p>
<p>And second, even if it gets digested in the stomach,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t move properly.</p>
<p>So then the next morning people get up and think,</p>
<p>of course, people consume some alcohol very often</p>
<p>and then they think that this is hangover,</p>
<p>but those who don&rsquo;t consume alcohol,</p>
<p>then they have the food hangover</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t digest.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one extreme example</p>
<p>where food at the wrong time can,</p>
<p>so healthy food at the wrong time can be crap or junk.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve experienced that</p>
<p>where if I&rsquo;ve worked late</p>
<p>or I couldn&rsquo;t eat dinner or something,</p>
<p>and then I get home,</p>
<p>I always debate whether or not to try and sleep.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m too hungry, oftentimes it&rsquo;s challenging.</p>
<p>And so for me,</p>
<p>sometimes consuming something</p>
<p>that at least seems easily digestible,</p>
<p>like yogurt or something in a liquid form</p>
<p>is better for me than if I eat a meal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made the mistake of going to the refrigerator,</p>
<p>being super hungry and eating a bunch of food</p>
<p>at 10 or 11 p.m. and then falling asleep.</p>
<p>And indeed the sleep,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m tired enough, can be quite deep.</p>
<p>But the next morning I feel just completely,</p>
<p>physically and cognitively weighed down.</p>
<p>So I think what you just described makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>So if someone were to select a feeding window,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not it falls</p>
<p>into classic intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>sounds like eating your first bite of food</p>
<p>and eating your last bite of food</p>
<p>at more or less the same time each day has benefits.</p>
<p>I have this question.</p>
<p>You mentioned feeding versus eating.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s actually not just</p>
<p>a grammatical semantic issue.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>We tend to think about</p>
<p>when you take your first bite of food</p>
<p>and then when you take your last bite of food.</p>
<p>But of course, foods digest at different rates,</p>
<p>more fat in there is gonna digest,</p>
<p>make carbohydrates digest slower, et cetera.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all these adjustments</p>
<p>to the glycemic index and so forth</p>
<p>with foods in combination.</p>
<p>Is it better to think about not eating</p>
<p>but your fed state and blood sugar?</p>
<p>So for instance, I often get asked on social media,</p>
<p>does blank break a fast?</p>
<p>So, and so I like to think about it scientifically</p>
<p>like, okay, does plain water break a fast?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Does air break a fast?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Does one grain of sugar, of sucrose break a fast?</p>
<p>Well, probably not.</p>
<p>But does one teaspoon of sugar break a fast?</p>
<p>Well, you could say yes, but transiently.</p>
<p>Like, so, I mean, when we&rsquo;re talking about breaking a fast,</p>
<p>are we talking about a rise in blood glucose</p>
<p>or are there molecular signals downstream</p>
<p>of a rise in blood glucose that cannot be reversed?</p>
<p>In other words, if I&rsquo;m gonna eat my first meal every day</p>
<p>at noon and I&rsquo;m gonna eat my last bite of food at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>and at 9 a.m. for whatever reason,</p>
<p>I have coffee with one teaspoon of sugar in it,</p>
<p>I suppose in the strictest sense, I&rsquo;ve broken my fast.</p>
<p>But maybe by, if I went for a hard run that morning,</p>
<p>maybe by 9.30 a.m. I&rsquo;m back in a quote unquote fasted state.</p>
<p>So what is the fasted state really?</p>
<p>Because when I&rsquo;m eating at 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>just to give another example,</p>
<p>I start fasting at 8.01 perhaps,</p>
<p>but I have my blood glucose is elevated,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not really fasted, I&rsquo;m fed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m not eating the verb, right?</p>
<p>Okay, so again, I don&rsquo;t wanna get overly detailed</p>
<p>just for sake of getting detail,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of the confusion out there</p>
<p>about what breaks a fast is related specifically</p>
<p>to this issue, which is if I eat a whole pizza</p>
<p>after sitting around all day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different than if I eat a whole pizza</p>
<p>after having run a 26 mile marathon that day.</p>
<p>Very different, metabolically speaking.</p>
<p>So how should people think about fasted versus fed?</p>
<p>Can we be mildly fasted versus severe fasted?</p>
<p>Can we be fed-ish versus very fed?</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll stop asking questions now,</p>
<p>but because they all relate to the same theme.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, these are very interesting question.</p>
<p>And then unfortunately, as you might have seen in life,</p>
<p>the most obvious questions are often unanswered</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so hard to do these damn experiments.</p>
<p>Because if you really want to address this in humans,</p>
<p>you have to bring humans, put them in isolation.</p>
<p>Just like you said, I can now imagine planning</p>
<p>five or six different experiments.</p>
<p>Each experiment should involve eight or 10 volunteers,</p>
<p>each gender, sex, and then do it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s go back to see how do we,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s dissect it in terms of say indirect calorimetry.</p>
<p>So for example, indirect calorimetry</p>
<p>is based on this principle that whatever oxygen</p>
<p>we breathe in and carbon dioxide we breathe out,</p>
<p>if we can measure these two, then we can figure out</p>
<p>whether our body in total, we are not saying</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the liver, gut, or fat, or muscle,</p>
<p>in total whether it&rsquo;s consuming glucose</p>
<p>or fat as energy source.</p>
<p>The idea is when we are without food for several hours,</p>
<p>then ideally our body will tap onto glycogen first</p>
<p>and then do a little bit of fat.</p>
<p>And then when the body is mostly running on fat,</p>
<p>then that ratio of CO2 to oxygen will come to 0.7.</p>
<p>But what is interesting is we can do these experiments</p>
<p>in mice.</p>
<p>So we can go to mice and ask, okay,</p>
<p>so what happens in mice?</p>
<p>So in mice, mice are a little bit very different</p>
<p>because mice are not simply little people.</p>
<p>Their metabolism is different.</p>
<p>They store relatively less glycogen than humans do.</p>
<p>In terms of total metabolism.</p>
<p>So they, overnight, within 12 to 14 hours,</p>
<p>the RER, respiratory exchange ratio,</p>
<p>or this ratio will go from one,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re consuming mostly glucose or carbohydrate</p>
<p>as energy source, it will slow down,</p>
<p>slowly go to 0.7, 0.75.</p>
<p>So after 12 to 14 hours,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of mostly running on fat.</p>
<p>So now, as we give them food,</p>
<p>within 10 or 15 minutes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not actually consuming couple of grams of food.</p>
<p>They might have consumed say 100 or 200 milligram</p>
<p>of that chow, so which is less than,</p>
<p>say, 5% of the food.</p>
<p>And then the RER will immediately begin to rise</p>
<p>as if that small amount of food</p>
<p>stopped that fat burning process</p>
<p>and cranked up the carbohydrate burning process.</p>
<p>When you say fat burning process,</p>
<p>you mean body fat stores being burned, right?</p>
<p>Not dietary fat, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s all body fat.</p>
<p>Means that&rsquo;s why I said,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know where that fat is being burned</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re just measuring</p>
<p>how much mice is breathing in and out.</p>
<p>So for example, it can be from the skin,</p>
<p>so subcutaneous fat or belly fat.</p>
<p>But not dietary fat?</p>
<p>No, by that time, the dietary fat is already absorbed</p>
<p>and digested and hopefully it&rsquo;s sitting in the liver</p>
<p>or adipose tissue somewhere,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the fat that&rsquo;s body fat.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you, Paul.</p>
<p>Yeah, the reason I ask is that nowadays,</p>
<p>I think more than half of the battles about nutrition</p>
<p>that I see online relate to this issue</p>
<p>where, I won&rsquo;t name names,</p>
<p>but someone will come along and say,</p>
<p>low-carbohydrate diet allows you to burn more fat.</p>
<p>And the more nuanced people out there will say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also talking about dietary fat.</p>
<p>You know, the word fat can confuse people.</p>
<p>I realize you&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>You are certainly not one of the people</p>
<p>guilty of doing this,</p>
<p>but indeed, you eat more fat, you&rsquo;ll burn more fat,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll burn more body fat.</p>
<p>In fact, I think the data say</p>
<p>that under conditions of caloric restriction,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually burn less.</p>
<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll probably get pitchforks</p>
<p>sent through the mail toward me on that one.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>whereas people who consume carbohydrate</p>
<p>can still burn body fat,</p>
<p>even though the majority of the fuel they&rsquo;re burning</p>
<p>is from carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So here, in this case, for example, for mice,</p>
<p>we know that as soon as they start eating,</p>
<p>the RER goes up.</p>
<p>Coming back to your question,</p>
<p>what would be ideal for us to do?</p>
<p>The experiment would be, okay,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll go back to that</p>
<p>and then give the mouse maybe 100 milligram of food,</p>
<p>and mouse runs around in the case,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll continue to measure</p>
<p>to see how long it takes for the mouse to come back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one aspect.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s see,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stay on this,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll come back and talk about non-caloric food</p>
<p>and whether that is considered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a famous experiment</p>
<p>that was published last year by Jyotaka Hasislav,</p>
<p>and it came out in Science.</p>
<p>And that relates to caloric restriction.</p>
<p>And we kind of started with this idea,</p>
<p>we started discussing that the rat experiments</p>
<p>were done with caloric restriction,</p>
<p>and researchers gave reduced calorie consumption</p>
<p>by 20% or 30% and gave that food.</p>
<p>The rats, and then subsequently mice,</p>
<p>and they all lived longer.</p>
<p>What is interesting is, in all those experiments,</p>
<p>the researchers came and gave this bolus of food</p>
<p>at one time, whereas the ad libitum-fed mice or rats,</p>
<p>they had access to food all the time.</p>
<p>So they were eating all the time,</p>
<p>and then these rats were given 20% less.</p>
<p>And what happens is, these mice or rats,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to take that less food,</p>
<p>which is restaurant now,</p>
<p>and just eat a little bit of lunch</p>
<p>and then snack after three hours or snack after three hours.</p>
<p>They gobble up all that food.</p>
<p>Within two to three hours, maximum four hours,</p>
<p>food is gone.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re sort of on the OMAD diet, the one meal a day.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re almost like in one meal a day,</p>
<p>three to four hours, food is gone.</p>
<p>Or you can say they&rsquo;re on four hours eating or feeding</p>
<p>and 20 hours fasting.</p>
<p>So then the question became,</p>
<p>well, the benefit of caloric restriction, as we know,</p>
<p>is it due to reduced calorie or time-restricted feeding?</p>
<p>Or there is a timing component to it,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re eating all of that within three to four hours,</p>
<p>and then there is a long fasting.</p>
<p>And this is a difficult question to answer,</p>
<p>because now you have to ask these poor grad students</p>
<p>or technicians to come and split that food</p>
<p>into eight or 10 or 15 different small portions</p>
<p>and then give them to mice in every two hours.</p>
<p>So Joe Takahashi, who actually published the first paper</p>
<p>in 2017 showing that most caloric restrictions,</p>
<p>I mean, he used the protocol</p>
<p>that was used by caloric restriction field.</p>
<p>It actually creates a condition of time restriction.</p>
<p>So he showed that, and then he went back</p>
<p>and worked with engineers to come up with a smart case</p>
<p>where he could actually tell,</p>
<p>he could program how much food is given to mice</p>
<p>at what time of the day or night, completely programmed.</p>
<p>So then he took this, for example,</p>
<p>suppose say the ad libitum fed mice</p>
<p>eats five grams of chow in a day.</p>
<p>And if you want to reduce calories by 20%,</p>
<p>then the CR mouse should get four grams of food.</p>
<p>And he divided this into nine or 10 meals</p>
<p>and then gave them in every 90 minutes.</p>
<p>So in this case, they are eating small meals</p>
<p>throughout day and night.</p>
<p>So there is no fasting.</p>
<p>So you can say that, well,</p>
<p>this mouse actually is not getting into fasting</p>
<p>because in every few hours is getting some food.</p>
<p>And then he measured how long the mouse is going to live.</p>
<p>And he used account,</p>
<p>means this is a very standard protocol.</p>
<p>People count how many mice are dying on which day</p>
<p>and then examine them to see whether they died</p>
<p>because there was an accident</p>
<p>or they actually, there was a natural cause.</p>
<p>And then they calculate at the end,</p>
<p>what is the half life?</p>
<p>So 50% survival, because that&rsquo;s on an average,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good indicator because if there is an outlier</p>
<p>that will live for a long time, then that can skew.</p>
<p>So what was interesting was the ad libitum fed mice,</p>
<p>of course, they live certain number of days.</p>
<p>And then this caloric restricted mice</p>
<p>that never got into super fasting,</p>
<p>but kind of eating, snacking throughout day and night,</p>
<p>that also lived 10% extra, 10% longer.</p>
<p>So that means caloric restriction</p>
<p>extended lifespan by 10%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wondered about this because recently,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>there were a bunch of news headlines</p>
<p>about intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>And frankly, I was frustrated</p>
<p>if you looked at one major news outlet,</p>
<p>they would say time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>affords no additional benefit</p>
<p>beyond caloric restriction for weight loss.</p>
<p>Then another popular press venue, let&rsquo;s call it that,</p>
<p>same study described as time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work, right?</p>
<p>And then another one that may be someplace</p>
<p>even more extreme, you know,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding only beneficial</p>
<p>because of caloric restriction or something like that.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ve essentially got</p>
<p>are three different interpretations of the same data,</p>
<p>all of which are, well, two of which are true,</p>
<p>one of which is false in my opinion.</p>
<p>But what I think people take away from that is,</p>
<p>oh, time-restricted feeding isn&rsquo;t valuable,</p>
<p>which is not the case.</p>
<p>I think for many people, it&rsquo;s a convenient way to eat</p>
<p>because at least for people like me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simpler to designate between portions of my day</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m eating and portions of my day when I&rsquo;m not eating</p>
<p>as opposed to portion control.</p>
<p>For other people, portion control can work.</p>
<p>But all of that is related to either maintenance</p>
<p>or loss of weight.</p>
<p>None of it deals with the potential health benefits</p>
<p>independent of weight loss, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that if we can segment those out,</p>
<p>obviously in humans, it&rsquo;s hard to know</p>
<p>if a given treatment or experiment is extending life</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>how long people would live anyway, right?</p>
<p>Whereas with mice, you have some sense</p>
<p>of when the mortality was likely to occur.</p>
<p>So what can we say about time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>and longevity in terms of biomarkers</p>
<p>or in terms of any other indication</p>
<p>that people who start and stop their feeding window</p>
<p>at a consistent time,</p>
<p>somewhere between eight and 12 hours per 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>are tilting the scales towards living longer</p>
<p>as opposed to living shorter?</p>
<p>This example of this news article that you mentioned</p>
<p>is really interesting</p>
<p>because that relates to Joe Takahashi&rsquo;s study</p>
<p>because I described that if you split calories</p>
<p>and eat throughout the day, throughout day and night,</p>
<p>then the mice live 10% extra.</p>
<p>But if you now give mouse the same calorie-restricted diet</p>
<p>and feed them during daytime,</p>
<p>whether within 12 hours or two hours,</p>
<p>then the mice live 10% extra.</p>
<p>Beyond that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So 20% longer?</p>
<p>40%.</p>
<p>So, okay, so let me make sure I understand</p>
<p>so that I make sure I understand.</p>
<p>If you take a certain number of calories</p>
<p>and you distribute them throughout the 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s caloric restriction, the mice will live 10% longer.</p>
<p>If you, however, restrict that to the active cycle,</p>
<p>so for humans, the daytime,</p>
<p>then they live 20% longer.</p>
<p>20% longer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just total caloric intake.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Meaning it&rsquo;s not just important</p>
<p>to be sub-maintenance in calories for sake of longevity.</p>
<p>It also is important as to when in the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>you eat those calories.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>So now, that&rsquo;s still, the story is not over</p>
<p>because these mice are fed during daytime</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not supposed to eat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So for us, it would be the equivalent</p>
<p>of being on the night shift and only eating at night,</p>
<p>but a sub-caloric, sub-maintenance calorie diet,</p>
<p>I guess is the right way to say it.</p>
<p>But when you fed mice during nighttime,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re supposed to eat,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting the same number of calories</p>
<p>within 12 hours or two hours,</p>
<p>then the mice live 35% longer than they control.</p>
<p>35% longer.</p>
<p>So scaled to human lifespan, which we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but 35% longer would mean that,</p>
<p>and again, no one knows, but humans now,</p>
<p>what is the average mortality in the United States?</p>
<p>Somewhere around 80?</p>
<p>The US life expectancy?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s around 80.</p>
<p>It used to be 80,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s reduced a little bit because of COVID,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s take 80.</p>
<p>Okay, so people are then now living</p>
<p>somewhere between 25 and 35 years longer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting some error bars on there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So that was really profound,</p>
<p>but now you pointed out biomarker and other stuff.</p>
<p>So now, if you look at any given time</p>
<p>within that experiment,</p>
<p>and actually Joe went back</p>
<p>and had a separate cohort of mice, very similar,</p>
<p>and so that he could take tissue samples,</p>
<p>and of course, in this case,</p>
<p>you have to sacrifice the mouse,</p>
<p>and he looked for,</p>
<p>he did a lot of molecular analysis with known markers.</p>
<p>For example, hemoglobin A1C equivalent</p>
<p>or glucose control, cholesterol, all this stuff.</p>
<p>He could not find anything that predicted</p>
<p>the benefit of caloric restriction.</p>
<p>So that means in this experiment,</p>
<p>whatever we know so far,</p>
<p>the predictor of longevity,</p>
<p>none of them could predict</p>
<p>whether this CR only mouse,</p>
<p>which ate throughout day and night,</p>
<p>that mouse is going to live less</p>
<p>than the night fed mouse</p>
<p>that was going to live 25% extra.</p>
<p>Does that mean that there are biomarkers</p>
<p>related to longevity</p>
<p>that we just haven&rsquo;t discovered yet?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s exactly.</p>
<p>So that means whatever we know so far</p>
<p>about biomarkers,</p>
<p>those he could not use to predict.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Maybe he wanted,</p>
<p>he had to use more number of mice to get that</p>
<p>because biomarkers are not going to predict</p>
<p>in every instance that there is some error.</p>
<p>What is also very interesting is</p>
<p>if you look at the body weight</p>
<p>and body composition of all these mice,</p>
<p>there is no difference in body weight</p>
<p>and body composition.</p>
<p>Across all these different groups?</p>
<p>Across all these groups.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter when they ate,</p>
<p>provided they were sub-maintenance calorie intake.</p>
<p>So fewer calories than is required</p>
<p>to maintain their weight.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t matter what pattern of eating,</p>
<p>they were the same weight.</p>
<p>So that in many ways seems to mimic</p>
<p>the human studies where they say,</p>
<p>look, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>whether or not you use caloric restriction</p>
<p>or you start your feeding window in the morning</p>
<p>or start your feeding window in the evening</p>
<p>or you portion control for sake of weight loss.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re taking a snapshot of that.</p>
<p>And then another thing with the human study</p>
<p>that we are referring to here,</p>
<p>in that human study,</p>
<p>people are actually already eating</p>
<p>within 10 hours window,</p>
<p>habitually, when they selected these people</p>
<p>to have them enroll in the study.</p>
<p>So they were already eating for 10 hours</p>
<p>and fasting for 14 hours.</p>
<p>All participants had to reduce their caloric intake</p>
<p>and they reduced by almost 25%.</p>
<p>The CR group continued with 10 hour sitting window</p>
<p>and the CR plus time restricted group</p>
<p>had to eat the same number of calories within eight hours.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a two hour difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a two hours difference.</p>
<p>Okay, so that people,</p>
<p>I just want to make sure people can understand.</p>
<p>So in this human study,</p>
<p>which is the one that I felt</p>
<p>that the popular press venues,</p>
<p>all except one venue,</p>
<p>got either semi-wrong or badly wrong</p>
<p>in terms of their conclusion.</p>
<p>That was my interpretation anyway,</p>
<p>was that either people came into the study</p>
<p>basically in a 10 hour feeding window,</p>
<p>which goes back to my first question,</p>
<p>which is that most people are not eating</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Or if they&rsquo;re on shift work and they are,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re sleeping during the day anyway.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re eating in a 10 to 12 hour feeding window anyway.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying they either did caloric restriction,</p>
<p>portion control within the 10 hour window</p>
<p>or another group within the study,</p>
<p>eight sub maintenance calories.</p>
<p>So caloric restriction, CR as we&rsquo;re calling it,</p>
<p>the acronym CR,</p>
<p>but restricted that to an eight hour feeding window.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t see any difference in terms of weight loss.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not all that surprising, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if it&rsquo;s just a two hour difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So we have done that experiment in mice</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t see difference in not only weight loss,</p>
<p>many other markers.</p>
<p>And I was telling you about this Joe Takahashi&rsquo;s paper</p>
<p>where I told you that he allowed his mice</p>
<p>to eat within two hours or 12 hours,</p>
<p>sub-caloric diet.</p>
<p>Two or 12.</p>
<p>Two or 12.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s dramatic.</p>
<p>But still he did not see change in longevity</p>
<p>even within those two.</p>
<p>So that means when you do caloric restriction</p>
<p>and then at least for mouse</p>
<p>and you are within 12 hours window,</p>
<p>that is giving the mice the best benefit,</p>
<p>the optimum benefit.</p>
<p>And two, three or five or 12 for a mouse doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>at least for longevity.</p>
<p>Can we conclude for humans that</p>
<p>whether or not a feeding window is four hours,</p>
<p>six hours, eight hours or 12 doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>provided the calories are similar or same?</p>
<p>Well, I won&rsquo;t go to that extent</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know many of these,</p>
<p>particularly we don&rsquo;t know how this sort of eating window</p>
<p>will affect both sexes because we always think</p>
<p>many of these mouse experiments,</p>
<p>even that I told you about,</p>
<p>those are done only in male mice.</p>
<p>But that should be changing, right?</p>
<p>Because the NIH, I know this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m on study section,</p>
<p>which is just a bunch of people who review grants,</p>
<p>is that every grant now has to include</p>
<p>sex as a biological variable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get away with,</p>
<p>or rather I should say it the way it should be stated,</p>
<p>which is people are required</p>
<p>and should want to look at these phenomenon</p>
<p>in male and female mice,</p>
<p>especially if there are differences.</p>
<p>So in this case, there are many,</p>
<p>I mean, there was also another paper</p>
<p>in time-restricted feeding that also came out,</p>
<p>a big paper showing that the thermogenesis</p>
<p>was accounting for loss in fat mass</p>
<p>in time-restricted fed mice.</p>
<p>That was also done only in male mice.</p>
<p>So this is, we are paying attention to it.</p>
<p>So we are now doing all of our studies in male and female,</p>
<p>and we do see big differences between male and female.</p>
<p>Coming back to humans,</p>
<p>what typically happens is when you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>four hours or six hours of time-restricted eating,</p>
<p>people will inadvertently reduce their caloric intake.</p>
<p>Yeah, just because of gut volume.</p>
<p>I tried one meal per day,</p>
<p>and I felt like I was eating so much at that one sitting</p>
<p>that it led to a lot of gastric distress,</p>
<p>and I got tired after the meal.</p>
<p>And part of the reason I like to do time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>is I have more energy.</p>
<p>And certainly in the fasted state, I feel more energized,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;m ingesting a little caffeine</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So people will reduce energy intake,</p>
<p>and then some people who are more active,</p>
<p>they can actually, unconsciously,</p>
<p>they may be spending more energy</p>
<p>in their physical activity and basal metabolic rate,</p>
<p>all of this combined, than how much they&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>And that can have a very adverse effect in long-term</p>
<p>because we know that this energy deficit,</p>
<p>and in fact, there is a scientific term for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called REDS, Relative Energy Deficit in Sports.</p>
<p>Relative Energy Deficit in Sports, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, because nearly 40% of athletes,</p>
<p>not the NFL guys, but, you know,</p>
<p>there are a lot of people who do track and field,</p>
<p>and nearly 40% of athletes actually experience this REDS</p>
<p>without knowing.</p>
<p>Can male and female athletes both experience REDS?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s REDS, R-E-D-S.</p>
<p>R-E-D-S, energy.</p>
<p>Relative Energy Deficit in Sports.</p>
<p>Interesting, this is the first I&rsquo;ve heard this acronym.</p>
<p>We have a new acronym, folks.</p>
<p>This is good to add to a list of other acronyms.</p>
<p>So males and females can experience it.</p>
<p>So in females, I&rsquo;ve heard that REDS can lead to amenorrhea,</p>
<p>so loss of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s so common, so prevalent</p>
<p>that, in fact, many women, many female athletes,</p>
<p>they take it for granted that, yes,</p>
<p>if they are more active,</p>
<p>then they will lose their menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>which may be common, but it&rsquo;s not normal</p>
<p>or optimum for health.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Even if they don&rsquo;t want to get pregnant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we had an expert on female hormones come on it</p>
<p>and say the very same thing,</p>
<p>that regular cycling is a-</p>
<p>Is very important.</p>
<p>Of ovulatory menstrual cycle is important</p>
<p>to try and maintain.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one,</p>
<p>but then what is really concerning is</p>
<p>it does affect bone health.</p>
<p>And in this state, people actually,</p>
<p>over a long period of time,</p>
<p>they lose bone mass,</p>
<p>and their bone also becomes more prone to injury,</p>
<p>micro fracture and fractures.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s a risk,</p>
<p>means if some people are trying to eat</p>
<p>within very short time</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re physically active, that happens.</p>
<p>And it also has impact on,</p>
<p>means the reason why</p>
<p>these women are losing menstrual cycle</p>
<p>is their HPG axis is disrupted,</p>
<p>hypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal axis.</p>
<p>And it starts, it may start even upstream</p>
<p>at hypothalamus or pituitary.</p>
<p>So that means that HPA axis,</p>
<p>hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal axis</p>
<p>may also get disrupted.</p>
<p>One of the symptoms of REDS</p>
<p>is also depression, anxiety, bipolar-like symptoms.</p>
<p>And we know that many,</p>
<p>many athletes experience that.</p>
<p>We think that, well, this may be just peer pressure</p>
<p>that always trying to compete.</p>
<p>And we know that unfortunately,</p>
<p>there are a few athletes who just can&rsquo;t cope it.</p>
<p>And there are many attempted suicide or suicide.</p>
<p>So this is a serious issue.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also another new topic in the lab</p>
<p>to come up with a mouse model of REDS</p>
<p>and then study it.</p>
<p>But this is one risk,</p>
<p>why we should not reduce our eating interval</p>
<p>to one meal or a very short time,</p>
<p>because it can have adverse side effect</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know now.</p>
<p>Maybe in future we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>when we systematically study them.</p>
<p>There are studies that are published</p>
<p>showing four hours and six hours time restricted eating</p>
<p>has benefits on weight loss.</p>
<p>But those are on healthy individuals</p>
<p>and they were in the study.</p>
<p>So the study team were already monitoring.</p>
<p>They made sure that there was no sudden weight loss</p>
<p>or weight loss below some safety level.</p>
<p>So those are very different from regular people</p>
<p>who may be even normal weight,</p>
<p>even within the healthy range.</p>
<p>If they do, then they can potentially.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why what we think is eight to 10 hours</p>
<p>may be the ideal spot to begin with.</p>
<p>And once you are physically active</p>
<p>and you are also spending a lot of energy</p>
<p>in physical activity or sports,</p>
<p>you can even go up to 12 hours</p>
<p>because in mice, we have done that experiment.</p>
<p>Up to 12 hours, they do get a lot of benefits, not all.</p>
<p>So this is 12 hours of-</p>
<p>12 hours of feeding, 12 hours of fasting.</p>
<p>In humans, again, nobody has done systematically 12 hours,</p>
<p>but there was one study in Europe</p>
<p>from Tin Hai Collette Lab.</p>
<p>And Tin Hai and I, we collaborate.</p>
<p>So they used our MyCardianClock app.</p>
<p>This is a research app we developed</p>
<p>just to, this is mostly used in time-restricted eating studies</p>
<p>and he had nearly,</p>
<p>I think he started with 200 Swiss participants,</p>
<p>but then at the end, he selected</p>
<p>and took very small number of groups,</p>
<p>people who are very meticulous</p>
<p>about recording all their food</p>
<p>and divided them into usual feeding,</p>
<p>whatever they wanted to eat, whenever they wanted to eat.</p>
<p>And they were given the advice of Swiss nutrition advice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s given to improve health and reduce blood glucose,</p>
<p>almost like diabetes prevention program in the US.</p>
<p>And then the other group was given advice</p>
<p>to eat within 12 hours.</p>
<p>This was very early on in time-restricted eating.</p>
<p>And we thought that the mice were getting some benefit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try whether 12 hours has any benefit.</p>
<p>The bottom line is at the end of three months and six months,</p>
<p>what he reported is both groups</p>
<p>lost same amount of body weight.</p>
<p>And then there was not too much significant difference</p>
<p>between groups,</p>
<p>but both groups actually improved their health.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is the Swiss nutritional advice</p>
<p>that he was giving, which is the standard of care there,</p>
<p>it achieved the same amount of weight loss</p>
<p>as just giving people this advice</p>
<p>that eat within 12 hours.</p>
<p>So one way to look at the result is like this.</p>
<p>And then he went to more extent</p>
<p>and actually looked at every single meal</p>
<p>these people consumed.</p>
<p>So there are close to,</p>
<p>I think close to 60 or 70,000 meal records</p>
<p>and pictures he went through</p>
<p>and then classified them to say</p>
<p>whether these are good quality food.</p>
<p>So they call it the NOVA classification,</p>
<p>one, two, three, four.</p>
<p>One is the food that you can almost eat raw,</p>
<p>fruits, vegetables, yogurt, dairy products</p>
<p>that you can almost without any preparation.</p>
<p>And then second, NOVA two is kind of home cooked food</p>
<p>that most people will prepare in a few minutes.</p>
<p>And then three, and then fourth one is</p>
<p>the food that you can never prepare at home.</p>
<p>So for example, biscuit or cookies</p>
<p>that we usually purchase and a few other things.</p>
<p>And usually the NOVA four are unhealthy,</p>
<p>ultra processed foods,</p>
<p>so which we should not be eating.</p>
<p>So the advice is to reduce NOVA four.</p>
<p>And what he found was people who got all this advice</p>
<p>to improve their nutrition quality,</p>
<p>they actually improved their nutrition quality,</p>
<p>they reduced their NOVA four food.</p>
<p>And people who were in time restricting</p>
<p>they ate within 12 hours,</p>
<p>they did not change their nutrition quality.</p>
<p>But what is interesting is they both got the same</p>
<p>modest weight loss.</p>
<p>So that begs the question that in the,</p>
<p>maybe Tin Hai will do this experiment again</p>
<p>to combine nutrition advice with time restriction</p>
<p>and maybe reduce the time to 10 hours,</p>
<p>and that might help.</p>
<p>So 12 hours is something that I say</p>
<p>anyone from five year old to 100 year old can do.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re trying to maintain weight</p>
<p>that might be a good way</p>
<p>and combine that with exercise, it&rsquo;ll be great.</p>
<p>And people can more easily avoid reds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for non-athletes or recreational exercisers,</p>
<p>it sounds like women,</p>
<p>if they distribute their calories across 12 hours</p>
<p>are less likely to lose their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So again, this is something that we have to look carefully.</p>
<p>They have to be,</p>
<p>because we do have the MyCircadianClock app</p>
<p>that many people download and self-monitor</p>
<p>and they share the data for researchers.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to that by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great tool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But once in a while we do get this input</p>
<p>from some women saying,</p>
<p>oh, I started doing your time restricting</p>
<p>and I am seeing all these problems.</p>
<p>And then I asked them,</p>
<p>okay, so what else are you doing?</p>
<p>They typically improve their nutrition quality.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re eating only salad and pew.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to increase their fiber intake.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard to eat so much of uncooked food</p>
<p>because cooking helps to absorb more nutrient.</p>
<p>And then at the same time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re running five miles every day.</p>
<p>And of course all of this combinedly</p>
<p>can lead to reds like symptom.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>12 I think is a good point</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re combining physical exercise</p>
<p>and better nutrition quality,</p>
<p>because in mice also we have seen</p>
<p>that if mice are eating healthy food</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re eating within 10 to 12 hours,</p>
<p>then they also live longer</p>
<p>than mice that are eating healthy food,</p>
<p>but distributing that calorie over a long period of time.</p>
<p>And this is Rafa DiCabo&rsquo;s finding from NIH.</p>
<p>He has systematically done this study</p>
<p>with two different types of diet and in mice.</p>
<p>And he finds the same thing</p>
<p>that even mice that are eating within 12 hours,</p>
<p>they do live longer than mice that eat randomly,</p>
<p>even healthy food.</p>
<p>I recall a recent study.</p>
<p>I think it was either published in Cell Reports</p>
<p>or Cell Reports Medicine.</p>
<p>Forgive me for not remembering which,</p>
<p>but both of course, Cell Press journals,</p>
<p>excellent journals,</p>
<p>which explored time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>in the context of low carbohydrate</p>
<p>or non-low carbohydrate diet.</p>
<p>So it was low carbohydrate</p>
<p>versus low carbohydrate and time-restricted.</p>
<p>So these are all caloric matched between groups</p>
<p>and then non-low carbohydrate diet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a more standard,</p>
<p>I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood</p>
<p>of 60% of calories from complex carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And as I recall, the greatest weight loss,</p>
<p>remember same calories across groups, folks,</p>
<p>was achieved with low carbohydrate plus caloric restriction.</p>
<p>And I wondered why all the popular news venues</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t cover that study,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m bringing it up now.</p>
<p>I thought this is really interesting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m somebody who&rsquo;s cycled low carbohydrate diet before.</p>
<p>I find it hard to sleep after about three or four days</p>
<p>of being on a low starch diet, just personally.</p>
<p>So I like to eat some starches,</p>
<p>especially if exercising intensely or working intensely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a little editorial there that,</p>
<p>but look, I know many people who do just feel better</p>
<p>on a low carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>but what do you think of those data?</p>
<p>Because it speaks to the idea that,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s not just the total number of calories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the quality of those calories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the timing of those calories</p>
<p>and maybe carbohydrate restriction</p>
<p>in conjunction with time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>might be the best path for people</p>
<p>who are looking to lose weight.</p>
<p>No, I totally agree that when it comes to nutrition,</p>
<p>quality, quantity, and timing, all these three matter.</p>
<p>Nearly 40% of people who maintain healthy body weight,</p>
<p>because 60% are overweight and obese,</p>
<p>40% are maintaining healthy body weight.</p>
<p>And out of those 40%, I would say nearly majority of them</p>
<p>are very aware about how much they&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>and what quality of food they&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re really an optimist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at the 40% of the glass that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>or should we say not full?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a pun intended.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a very interesting way of looking at it.</p>
<p>Rather than saying, why are 60% of Americans obese?</p>
<p>Saying, why are 40% not obese?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting way to look at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, subconsciously,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always making that decision.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m sure that you are not going</p>
<p>and eating cheeseburger every day</p>
<p>because you want to improve.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I enjoy a cheeseburger now and again,</p>
<p>but no, certainly not at this stage</p>
<p>or any stage of my life.</p>
<p>I think that, I think people,</p>
<p>I actually think the pandemic had a lot to do with this.</p>
<p>I think that people started to take a look</p>
<p>at what they were doing to support</p>
<p>or not support their health generally.</p>
<p>I know people gained a lot of weight during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Other people got really into fitness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some colleagues, so you&rsquo;ve always maintained,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve always been in good shape.</p>
<p>Actually, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen you in a while</p>
<p>and you seem to have aged backwards.</p>
<p>So you are a poster for your own ideas</p>
<p>and hypotheses about time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>But I noticed that during the pandemic,</p>
<p>a number of people emerged from the pandemic</p>
<p>in better shape, other people in much worse shape.</p>
<p>It seemed like it was like a bimodal distribution there.</p>
<p>So yeah, I get the sense that starting and stopping eating</p>
<p>at more or less the same time each day,</p>
<p>even if caloric restriction is not the main focus,</p>
<p>has additional benefits.</p>
<p>Can we talk about some of those benefits</p>
<p>as they relate to the other things that impact health?</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re starting and stopping eating</p>
<p>at more or less the same times each day,</p>
<p>are you sleeping better?</p>
<p>Are you getting more predictable shifts</p>
<p>in alertness and sleepiness?</p>
<p>Like, can you predict when you&rsquo;ll feel good enough</p>
<p>to exercise?</p>
<p>Maybe we could talk about that</p>
<p>because you, of course, are well-known</p>
<p>for time-restricted feeding and the science around that,</p>
<p>but also other things as well,</p>
<p>not the least of which is circadian biology generally.</p>
<p>So I always think of the main timekeepers for our system</p>
<p>being feeding, light, activity, and social connection.</p>
<p>Did I miss?</p>
<p>And temperature.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how do these combine with one another?</p>
<p>Using timing that we begin and stop feeding</p>
<p>is kind of an anchor point.</p>
<p>Can we explore that a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we got into this beginning and end,</p>
<p>and then you asked for the calorie,</p>
<p>how much calorie will break the fast.</p>
<p>One thing that I want the listeners and viewers</p>
<p>to bring back to this timing of when we are breaking the fast</p>
<p>because we equate health with weight, body weight.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we are talking about nutrition quality</p>
<p>and quantity because both of them have impact.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s think about mental health</p>
<p>because a lot of people do struggle with mental health.</p>
<p>They have anxiety or depression and also gut health</p>
<p>because there are a lot of people</p>
<p>who also have acid reflux or heartburn.</p>
<p>And we know that acid reflux or heartburn</p>
<p>can be exacerbated by caffeine intake in empty stomach.</p>
<p>Those who have acid reflux or heartburn,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re prone to that.</p>
<p>Then having black coffee in the morning</p>
<p>before any food can upset their stomach.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why in those cases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clearly that caffeine for them</p>
<p>becomes the trigger that something,</p>
<p>the food is supposed to come</p>
<p>and then the stomach is not seeing the food.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s overreacting, producing excess acid,</p>
<p>and that comes up to the esophagus,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>So if people have that kind of condition,</p>
<p>then maybe they should consider</p>
<p>when they drink their first coffee</p>
<p>is breaking their overall fast</p>
<p>or kind of putting their health at risk for acid reflux.</p>
<p>The other thing is people who have anxiety, panic attack,</p>
<p>we know that caffeine can jazz you up.</p>
<p>Especially on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Especially on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>So for them, again, caffeine can be a trigger.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I want to kind of differentiate</p>
<p>that there is this mental health</p>
<p>and other aspects of health.</p>
<p>And these are two clear examples</p>
<p>where anxiety, panic attack related to brain health,</p>
<p>or acid reflux related to our gut health.</p>
<p>In those cases, when we consume that caffeine</p>
<p>in the morning can affect.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Do you avoid caffeine in the morning?</p>
<p>No, actually, here is the interesting history about caffeine</p>
<p>and this is something I did not know.</p>
<p>And I was once invited to this history</p>
<p>of nighttime activity.</p>
<p>And maybe we can take a little bit of detour</p>
<p>and talk about nighttime activity</p>
<p>because that fascinates me as a circadian biologist.</p>
<p>Because over the last 200,000 years,</p>
<p>means we assume that humans, homo sapiens,</p>
<p>evolved 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>So we have been, as a species,</p>
<p>we have been living on this planet for 200,000 years.</p>
<p>And only in the last, you can say,</p>
<p>couple of thousand or 5,000 years</p>
<p>when we came to control fire,</p>
<p>or maybe you can even go back to 100,000 years,</p>
<p>there is some debate.</p>
<p>So then the question is, well,</p>
<p>when you control fire</p>
<p>and we lighted up the fire</p>
<p>and we could light up whenever we wanted,</p>
<p>we can add fuel and we can stop the fire</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key ability in humans</p>
<p>that differentiates them from all the other species.</p>
<p>No other species.</p>
<p>We can always say, yes,</p>
<p>there are signs of this intelligent decision-making.</p>
<p>For example, we know many crows can make decisions,</p>
<p>many animals, they kind of figure out,</p>
<p>strategize how to get food,</p>
<p>but controlled use of fire</p>
<p>is something very specific to human.</p>
<p>And when we started controlling fire,</p>
<p>fire did not essentially extend the day</p>
<p>because fire created an evening</p>
<p>that was very different from what people did during the day.</p>
<p>And what people used to do during the day,</p>
<p>they walked a lot,</p>
<p>means gathering food was almost everything that we did.</p>
<p>And so in the evening after we brought food,</p>
<p>mostly tubers or maybe lentils to cook</p>
<p>or once in a while animals so that we could barbecue,</p>
<p>all of those things happened around fire.</p>
<p>And fire was so expensive</p>
<p>that it was mostly communal fire.</p>
<p>So if you go back to, for example,</p>
<p>Maasai and all these, sorry,</p>
<p>populations that have no access to electricity</p>
<p>and are still living kind of that historical life,</p>
<p>fire is a communal event.</p>
<p>And they sat around, they cooked food.</p>
<p>And then what happened?</p>
<p>They did not talk about war.</p>
<p>They talked about culture.</p>
<p>They sang, they danced.</p>
<p>They strategize.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how politics started, philosophy started,</p>
<p>science started, all of these things</p>
<p>that are very unique to human civilization</p>
<p>started around fireside chat.</p>
<p>So in that way, if you think about it,</p>
<p>we are still doing fireside chat.</p>
<p>The only thing is we have the microwave</p>
<p>and the television, our social media.</p>
<p>So now we chat with our phones, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still, so we are hooked to that evening activity</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when we are completely free</p>
<p>from the pressure of the work.</p>
<p>And we want to express ourselves,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our independent time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why most people find it very difficult</p>
<p>to do timeless eating and stop eating at six o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s ingrained in our even DNA</p>
<p>that we want to eat and socialize in the evening.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s fast forward and see</p>
<p>what is the role of coffee in this?</p>
<p>And if you look at coffee consumption,</p>
<p>particularly cafe where people can come</p>
<p>and have a little bit of coffee and socialize,</p>
<p>it also started as a evening activity.</p>
<p>And this is in, now we can go back to Istanbul</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one place where coffee cafes</p>
<p>started in mid 16th century.</p>
<p>So we are talking about 1540 to 1570.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m forgetting the name of historians</p>
<p>who actually invited me.</p>
<p>And, okay, his name is Cemal Keferdar.</p>
<p>And I must be butchering the name, but I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>We will provide the spelling.</p>
<p>And the wonderful thing about social media</p>
<p>is somebody will tell us on YouTube,</p>
<p>the proper pronunciation.</p>
<p>So this is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>If you know the proper pronunciation,</p>
<p>please put it in the comments on YouTube.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m even checking right now</p>
<p>in my EndNote library, it&rsquo;s not picking up that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;ll provide a link.</p>
<p>So what happened was, so coffee was introduced</p>
<p>and people came and drank coffee and talked about politics.</p>
<p>At night.</p>
<p>At night, at evening.</p>
<p>And it actually started with Sufi branch of Islam</p>
<p>because they are the ones who consumed coffee</p>
<p>in the evening.</p>
<p>And this is the branch of Islam</p>
<p>where they actually sing and dance</p>
<p>and all that happened in the evening.</p>
<p>So singing, dancing by the Sufis.</p>
<p>And then here in Istanbul, people started congregating</p>
<p>and having talk about politics.</p>
<p>But then around the same time,</p>
<p>some, you know, in Turkey,</p>
<p>there was a good sizable number of Muslims</p>
<p>who have to do five prayers a day,</p>
<p>number of prayers at set time.</p>
<p>The first prayer is very early in the morning.</p>
<p>And then they figured out that if they wake up</p>
<p>and immediately have coffee,</p>
<p>then they can stay awake for the first prayer.</p>
<p>And in that way, they felt pretty good when they woke up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how it started as a morning drink,</p>
<p>to stay awake and kind of get on with the day.</p>
<p>But what happened was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether you have ever tried Turkish coffee,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very thick.</p>
<p>Yeah, a few years ago, right before the pandemic, 2019,</p>
<p>I traveled to Turkey.</p>
<p>First of all, the food is amazing.</p>
<p>The coffee is indeed very, very thick.</p>
<p>And I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance</p>
<p>from drinking so much coffee in Yerba Mate over the years,</p>
<p>and still do, I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s very intense.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re saying is that,</p>
<p>coffee intake started as a way to extend into the night.</p>
<p>The ability to extend into the night at all</p>
<p>was because of the ability to harness fire.</p>
<p>And then coffee&rsquo;s stimulatory properties</p>
<p>were leveraged toward morning,</p>
<p>which is essentially like, the way I think about it,</p>
<p>we did an episode on caffeine and someone else,</p>
<p>Michael Pollan, not I, described it this way,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re sort of taking a loan out</p>
<p>on your energy bank account with coffee.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re suppressing the adenosine system,</p>
<p>adenosine makes you sleepy,</p>
<p>but that adenosine system will kick in later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a credit card of sorts, with an interest, right?</p>
<p>And the interest being an energetic lag</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to experience in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But what happened was, with the strong coffee,</p>
<p>that gave heartburn and acid reflux to a lot of people.</p>
<p>So then, they started eating something with coffee.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the culture of breakfast started in Turkey.</p>
<p>Ah, so coffee actually led to the development of breakfast,</p>
<p>not the other way around.</p>
<p>Yeah, so-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very heartening, again, no pun intended,</p>
<p>for the caffeine lovers among us,</p>
<p>which I count myself one of those.</p>
<p>So essentially, the food before coffee became breakfast.</p>
<p>So you kind of give something to your stomach,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s busy digesting that.</p>
<p>And then when the coffee comes in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not reacting to coffee and creating acid reflux.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t that breakfast is necessary on its own,</p>
<p>it was essentially a buffer against the gastric distress</p>
<p>caused by caffeine intake.</p>
<p>At least in that culture, in that context.</p>
<p>We cannot say that whether the same thing happened</p>
<p>in all over the world where coffee is not consumed,</p>
<p>but still people eat something in the morning.</p>
<p>You said you start your first meal of the day</p>
<p>at around eight, what time do you wake up?</p>
<p>I wake up around six, 5.30 to six.</p>
<p>What time do you have your first caffeine?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I brought up this story</p>
<p>because I have coffee after my breakfast.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of delaying caffeine intake</p>
<p>for a few hours after waking,</p>
<p>for other reasons that my listeners</p>
<p>have heard me talk about endlessly,</p>
<p>so I won&rsquo;t bother with that now.</p>
<p>But I think allowing,</p>
<p>just suffice to say that allowing</p>
<p>some of the natural waking up signals to occur</p>
<p>and using light to kind of clear away</p>
<p>and adenosine to further extend an activity</p>
<p>is better than using a stimulant,</p>
<p>but until a few hours later.</p>
<p>This is fascinating because I&rsquo;ve never thought</p>
<p>about the link between extension into the night,</p>
<p>socialization, or socializing rather,</p>
<p>feeding and caffeine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back</p>
<p>about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation-based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on</p>
<p>in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,</p>
<p>hormones, lipids, and other things</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>to bring those numbers into the ranges</p>
<p>that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.</p>

<p>Now, actually, I&rsquo;m kind of speaking</p>
<p>what many other researchers have found,</p>
<p>and this particularly, this fireside chat,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m forgetting again the name of the scientist.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s from University of Washington, Seattle.</p>
<p>She went to Africa and kind of recorded</p>
<p>what people are talking.</p>
<p>Of course, she could not understand what they were talking.</p>
<p>Twitter and whether or not Tesla&rsquo;s stock is going up,</p>
<p>of course.</p>
<p>No, no, no, just kidding, folks.</p>
<p>And then came back and tried to translate</p>
<p>and then figured out that what they were talking</p>
<p>during daytime and in the evening were very different.</p>
<p>What are they talking about at night?</p>
<p>Exactly, so this is like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about matchmaking</p>
<p>and talking about politics and strategizing</p>
<p>to gather food or even singing and dancing.</p>
<p>So this is, if we think about it,</p>
<p>how we manage sunset to our bedtime,</p>
<p>what we do between sunset and bedtime</p>
<p>affects most of our health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna think about that for a moment.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m a huge believer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m living in great hope for the idea</p>
<p>that right now, I do think that scientists understand</p>
<p>a lot more about the different stages of sleep,</p>
<p>slow-wave sleep, REM sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>than we do active waking states.</p>
<p>Like we talk about being focused or being alert,</p>
<p>but those aren&rsquo;t scientific terms, as we know.</p>
<p>But I do believe, and I&rsquo;ve noticed a distinct difference</p>
<p>between the first eight hours of the day</p>
<p>in terms of cognition.</p>
<p>And we know that the catecholamines</p>
<p>are at much higher levels plus cortisol.</p>
<p>So dopamine, cortisol, epinephrine,</p>
<p>all of that is really at much higher levels</p>
<p>than in the later evening.</p>
<p>And so this evening time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly in the context of mental health.</p>
<p>We know that morning and evening,</p>
<p>we are basically different creatures.</p>
<p>Yeah, completely.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s why I think in the evening,</p>
<p>if you think about it, again,</p>
<p>this is, again, another set of research</p>
<p>from my good friend Horacio who-</p>
<p>The Iglesias.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Horacio&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a fellow Argentine.</p>
<p>So occasionally we riff about things related to that,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a wonderful biologist.</p>
<p>Are you guys collaborating?</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s kind of, I say he&rsquo;s very humble</p>
<p>and keeps a low profile,</p>
<p>but he does amazing, amazing research.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>And he does research that we want to know,</p>
<p>but nobody is ready to do it</p>
<p>because field research is very difficult</p>
<p>to go to the wilderness or go to the places</p>
<p>where there is no electricity</p>
<p>and then record when these people are eating,</p>
<p>sleeping, or in this case, activity,</p>
<p>exposure to light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Horacio has done.</p>
<p>And he puts this active watch,</p>
<p>which is kind of a modern activity tracker,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit more refined</p>
<p>because it also collects light information.</p>
<p>What he found was most of these Argentinian tovas</p>
<p>who have no access to electricity,</p>
<p>they consistently go to bed</p>
<p>somewhere between three to three and a half hours</p>
<p>after sunset.</p>
<p>So this is very important</p>
<p>because we always think that our ancestors,</p>
<p>when they didn&rsquo;t have electricity,</p>
<p>as soon as the sun went down,</p>
<p>they just went to sleep.</p>
<p>No, the fire extended their evening.</p>
<p>So they were staying awake for three to four hours,</p>
<p>kind of decompressing themselves, that we say,</p>
<p>and then doing all these activities,</p>
<p>cooking, sharing meals,</p>
<p>and then they would go to sleep.</p>
<p>And if you look at the sleep onset variability,</p>
<p>it was very small.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re going to bed</p>
<p>almost within 15 to 30 minutes standard deviation.</p>
<p>So no night owls versus morning people.</p>
<p>Exactly, so we&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>
<p>None of this, I get attacked for many reasons.</p>
<p>It just goes with the business I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>of being public facing these days.</p>
<p>But every time I talk about viewing sunrise</p>
<p>or low angle sunlight,</p>
<p>getting some sunlight early in the day,</p>
<p>someone says, well, I&rsquo;m a night owl.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like a protest</p>
<p>of trying to protect identity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become this ideological identity related thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a night owl.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a morning person and I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re telling me that in these cultures</p>
<p>where there isn&rsquo;t electricity, but there is fire,</p>
<p>people are going to sleep within all of them,</p>
<p>within about 15 minutes of one another.</p>
<p>So there is no such thing as a night owl</p>
<p>or a morning person in the context.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Horacio actually asked him pointedly</p>
<p>because, and then he said, no, he has not seen.</p>
<p>Means he has tracked hundreds of people.</p>
<p>And if we ask, there are many, many sleep researchers</p>
<p>or at least the public facing sleep physicians or experts,</p>
<p>they will say, yeah, we can say one third of people</p>
<p>are night owl, one third are morning,</p>
<p>and then one third are in between.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Yeah, they call them like bears, wolves,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not being disparaging of that idea.</p>
<p>I think people really do feel as if they orient</p>
<p>towards one pattern or another.</p>
<p>When I was an undergrad student,</p>
<p>I never went to bed before midnight.</p>
<p>And actually, midnight was my going to bed time.</p>
<p>Exactly like 11.45, I&rsquo;ll try to get ready to hit bed.</p>
<p>And then by 12, I&rsquo;m in bed.</p>
<p>And I used to get up at 6, 6.15.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still, that&rsquo;s a pretty short sleep.</p>
<p>With an alarm, of course.</p>
<p>But then daytime, I used to take 45 minutes to one hour nap.</p>
<p>And that was regular.</p>
<p>Like, even if, whenever I got time.</p>
<p>Of course, in college, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the whole day.</p>
<p>Unlike in high school, you don&rsquo;t have opportunity to nap.</p>
<p>But in college, you can.</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve been one of those kids</p>
<p>with his hoodie on napping on the desk,</p>
<p>but they come around and they wake you up.</p>
<p>Yeah, but in this case, just come back to the dorm</p>
<p>and after lunch, usually I used to take nap.</p>
<p>So then in grad school,</p>
<p>I remember I rarely went to bed before 2 a.m.</p>
<p>And I could have clearly said that I&rsquo;m a night owl.</p>
<p>And actually, I was a night owl.</p>
<p>I was very comfortable staying up so late.</p>
<p>I was very productive, doing experiments,</p>
<p>writing all these manuscripts mostly.</p>
<p>But then afterwards, when I look back in post-doc,</p>
<p>when I had, when we had our daughter,</p>
<p>then things started changing</p>
<p>because you have to put the baby to sleep.</p>
<p>And then after the baby sleeps,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost when you have a baby,</p>
<p>your life revolves around the baby.</p>
<p>So then we had to dim down the light.</p>
<p>There is no caffeine and alcohol drinking</p>
<p>or any other things after the baby sleeps</p>
<p>because we cannot do too much noise.</p>
<p>So then I realized that, no, I&rsquo;m actually not a night owl.</p>
<p>And I became kind of more normal</p>
<p>because I could go to sleep between 10 and 11.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I thought,</p>
<p>well, maybe this was very unique to me.</p>
<p>But what is interesting is I have another colleague,</p>
<p>good friend, Ken Wright Jr.</p>
<p>At Colorado.</p>
<p>At Colorado.</p>
<p>And he also had grad students and post-docs like me</p>
<p>who strongly believed that they were night owls,</p>
<p>just like everybody else.</p>
<p>And Ken took the whole lab for camping.</p>
<p>And when they were camping, of course, there is less light</p>
<p>and a lot of physical activity, hiking during the day.</p>
<p>And they all went to bed between 9 and 10.30 p.m.</p>
<p>I love that study.</p>
<p>What Sachin just described was a study.</p>
<p>I think there were two studies.</p>
<p>There were two, yeah.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting, as I recall,</p>
<p>was that after going camping for a weekend</p>
<p>where people wake more or less with the sunrise</p>
<p>and go to sleep a few hours after sunset,</p>
<p>their melatonin rhythms and cortisol rhythms</p>
<p>and sleep-wake rhythms persisted on that schedule</p>
<p>for several weeks, despite returning to environments</p>
<p>where there was a lot of artificial lighting,</p>
<p>which I find amazing that just a weekend</p>
<p>of consistent rising and going to bed</p>
<p>with the sunrise and sunset, more or less,</p>
<p>allowed a reset that was very long-lasting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So actually, even in Horacio&rsquo;s study,</p>
<p>he found that almost all the tovas,</p>
<p>they wake up around sunrise time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing when I look at the standard deviation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like so tight.</p>
<p>So take that, night owls, so-called night owls.</p>
<p>I also, in graduate school, I would work until 2 a.m.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>I would blast music in the lab.</p>
<p>Everyone was at home, pretty much.</p>
<p>Not everyone, but there were the night crew.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d get in sometime around,</p>
<p>get up sometime around 9.30, 10,</p>
<p>and then get in around 11, and it was no problem</p>
<p>because I was going to stay so very late.</p>
<p>And then over time, I noticed I&rsquo;d become more locked</p>
<p>to a standard schedule.</p>
<p>So I think what we&rsquo;re saying is that the clock can,</p>
<p>our internal clocks can shift,</p>
<p>but this idea that we are genetically biased</p>
<p>towards one schedule or another may need revisiting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the conclusion I&rsquo;m taking from this.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are a couple of aspects.</p>
<p>One is, you know, some people are genetically</p>
<p>so pre-programmed because the other flip side</p>
<p>is what is called technically</p>
<p>familial advanced sleep phase syndrome.</p>
<p>So these people, you can give them caffeine or whatever,</p>
<p>but they will fall asleep, say, at eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>They cannot stay awake till nine or 10.</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s a very strong phenotype</p>
<p>in sleep and circadian rhythm field,</p>
<p>they are very well studied.</p>
<p>So in fact, Louis Ptacek and Nguyen Phu,</p>
<p>they were the first one to track one family like this,</p>
<p>and then they figured out there was a mutation</p>
<p>in one of the clock genes, period two, that clock gene,</p>
<p>and that mutation allowed the clock to run in a way</p>
<p>that these people went to bed very early.</p>
<p>I guess historically, given these fireside chats,</p>
<p>those people were probably not contributing much</p>
<p>to the political discussion.</p>
<p>Whatever there was decided after they went to sleep</p>
<p>is what they woke up into.</p>
<p>That reminds me, because as you were describing</p>
<p>the difference between nighttime discussions</p>
<p>versus morning discussions,</p>
<p>is there any theme to what is discussed in the morning</p>
<p>versus in the nighttime,</p>
<p>or are people just sipping their,</p>
<p>eating and sipping their caffeine and just waking up?</p>
<p>But are there any ideas</p>
<p>about what morning discussions really consist of?</p>
<p>Morning discussions or daytime discussions</p>
<p>are mostly about work,</p>
<p>and like hunting, gathering, or farming, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And even these days, that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>I go to work and it&rsquo;s mostly one meeting after another,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about how,</p>
<p>means if you&rsquo;re in different committees</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re solving problems,</p>
<p>or your students come with questions,</p>
<p>you have your TA or the office hours,</p>
<p>all these things, work-related.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking, I mean, serious philosophy,</p>
<p>unless you are in a philosophy department</p>
<p>and you are talking about political science.</p>
<p>And also, we are not singing and dancing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the evening activity,</p>
<p>even these days, are very different.</p>
<p>And typically, the evening activities</p>
<p>are where we express ourselves.</p>
<p>We express who we are.</p>
<p>We feel like we are free.</p>
<p>And you and I, we have this academic intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>We can talk about our work, just like we are talking now.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who work for,</p>
<p>even in tech industry, they may be working for Google</p>
<p>and all these big tech companies.</p>
<p>They cannot talk about their work to anybody else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all secret.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all secret.</p>
<p>So just imagine, they&rsquo;re staying,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re spending more than half of their wake-up time</p>
<p>at work, thinking and doing work,</p>
<p>but they cannot talk about that work,</p>
<p>even sometimes to their own family members.</p>
<p>So then what happens for them,</p>
<p>a lot of people also do the same thing,</p>
<p>like the person who is going and baking</p>
<p>in a restaurant or cooking,</p>
<p>or the person who is taking trucks and driving.</p>
<p>Or nurses and doctors can&rsquo;t talk about their patients.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s confidentiality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And some people just don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so stressful.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to bring that stress home.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I always say that from sunset</p>
<p>until we go to bed, during that time,</p>
<p>we try to find time for ourselves.</p>
<p>People say, this is me time.</p>
<p>The me time is essentially,</p>
<p>we want to truly express who we are,</p>
<p>or we want to entertain ourselves.</p>
<p>Because on the fireside chat,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that everybody was a performer.</p>
<p>There are also some audience.</p>
<p>So we always switch our roles.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are performing,</p>
<p>and sometimes we are observing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what happens with me time.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>So maybe social media time should be restricted</p>
<p>to just maybe a small portion of that evening time.</p>
<p>Because I would hope that people</p>
<p>would also interact socially in the real sense.</p>
<p>Or maybe in a constructive way,</p>
<p>or maybe you use that to connect with your family members,</p>
<p>whom you love,</p>
<p>or you can have some productive discussion or something.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s extremely interesting,</p>
<p>because I think, again,</p>
<p>this conversation about time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>is really a conversation about-</p>
<p>Cicadian rhythms.</p>
<p>And sleep-wake activity and human evolution, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why, let&rsquo;s go back to this night owl.</p>
<p>Because we kind of made a comment</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s not genetic,</p>
<p>but this is where I&rsquo;m still wrapping my head around.</p>
<p>Because these days, there&rsquo;s some GWAS studies</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re trying to look at night owls</p>
<p>to see whether there are some genetic linkings.</p>
<p>And sometimes we always think,</p>
<p>yeah, if you take half a million people,</p>
<p>of course you&rsquo;ll find some loci.</p>
<p>But going back to this idea</p>
<p>that are some people more sensitive to light,</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s likely that the same level of light,</p>
<p>even in the same household,</p>
<p>may make some people stay awake late into the night,</p>
<p>whereas other people are more resistant to light,</p>
<p>so that they can go to bed early.</p>
<p>And since light has become so prevalent these days,</p>
<p>and this TOBA story that we are talking about,</p>
<p>or people going on camping,</p>
<p>that is, we have removed that light.</p>
<p>So there is some evidence that people&rsquo;s light sensitivity,</p>
<p>particularly the IPRGC,</p>
<p>or this intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell,</p>
<p>or the simple speak is the blue light sensors in our eyes,</p>
<p>there seems to be even one log unit change in sensitivity</p>
<p>as measured by pupil constriction.</p>
<p>So for some people,</p>
<p>a small amount of artificial light at night</p>
<p>could really shift their circadian clock,</p>
<p>wake them up, essentially.</p>
<p>And then for some, it may not.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very sensitive to light at night,</p>
<p>exquisitely sensitive to it.</p>
<p>Oh, so then you are like a teenager.</p>
<p>Yes, in many ways, I&rsquo;ve been told this, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think.</p>
<p>I have actually switched to using a red night light,</p>
<p>but I should be clear,</p>
<p>not a fancy high cost red light</p>
<p>for sake of any kind of infrared simulation,</p>
<p>but a red party light type light.</p>
<p>And I find that was based on reading one study</p>
<p>that we covered in an episode on jet lag and shift work,</p>
<p>which was that it seems to reduce</p>
<p>the cortisol releasing properties of light at night</p>
<p>to use red shifted light.</p>
<p>So I just use a red light bulb.</p>
<p>I actually travel with one.</p>
<p>If I go to an Airbnb or a hotel and I switch to red light,</p>
<p>and I find that I fall asleep and stay asleep</p>
<p>throughout the night much more consistently,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m in new environments,</p>
<p>which always makes it disruptive to sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made an enormous difference</p>
<p>in the depth and duration of my sleep.</p>
<p>And because oftentimes hotel lights,</p>
<p>you know, in the bathroom, you&rsquo;ll turn them on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just getting beam.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, some people don&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to be bothered by that.</p>
<p>I really struggle with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in fact, in teenagers, right after puberty,</p>
<p>there seems to be, I think that&rsquo;s when the teenagers</p>
<p>become more sensitive to light.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s well known</p>
<p>that the teenage boys and girls,</p>
<p>they tend to stay awake late into the night</p>
<p>and they can stay up to 12 past midnight.</p>
<p>Although they can stay up that late,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean that their sleep schedule is reduced.</p>
<p>Their body still needs the same amount of sleep</p>
<p>as other teenagers.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they are more likely not to wake up</p>
<p>at 6.30 or 7.00 when we expect them to wake up</p>
<p>and go to school.</p>
<p>I have a question and I ask every circadian</p>
<p>related biologists that I can come into contact with this,</p>
<p>and no one has been able to give me an answer</p>
<p>one way or the other.</p>
<p>But I grew up hearing that every hour of sleep</p>
<p>before midnight was of more value or potency</p>
<p>than the hours after midnight.</p>
<p>And indeed I find that if I go to sleep at 9.30 or 10.00 p.m.</p>
<p>I can wake up at three or 4.00 a.m.</p>
<p>feeling pretty fantastic and ready to lean into the day.</p>
<p>But if I get the equivalent number of hours of sleep</p>
<p>starting at midnight, I feel like complete garbage</p>
<p>when I wake up after five, six hours.</p>
<p>So is there any truth to the idea that going to sleep</p>
<p>within three hours of sunset is somehow better</p>
<p>for our circadian timing mechanisms?</p>
<p>Well, there are a few things.</p>
<p>One, you said that you are very sensitive to light.</p>
<p>So I assume that you also avoid bright light in the evening.</p>
<p>As best I can, yeah.</p>
<p>As best as you could, can.</p>
<p>And then what is happening is with absence</p>
<p>of that bright light, your melatonin levels begin to rise.</p>
<p>So you are prepared for sleep.</p>
<p>Of course, this is something that we cannot measure</p>
<p>because measuring melatonin in every one hour</p>
<p>or 30 minutes is very difficult</p>
<p>and there is no consumer-facing product yet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s likely that your body is preparing very well</p>
<p>under this dim light to fall asleep.</p>
<p>And when you are trying to stay awake</p>
<p>and go sleep at midnight, then maybe from midnight</p>
<p>for the first three or four hours, you are sleeping well.</p>
<p>But then after that, your melatonin level</p>
<p>might be beginning to fall.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only melatonin, your core body temperature</p>
<p>and then your heart rate and everything is changing</p>
<p>to make you awake.</p>
<p>But the sleep debt that you have accumulated</p>
<p>is pushing you to be in bed.</p>
<p>So there is this tension between the circadian aspect</p>
<p>and your sleep debt.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, you cannot have good night</p>
<p>of restorative sleep for the second half of the sleep</p>
<p>because of the tension.</p>
<p>That makes good sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s why you are not the only one.</p>
<p>There are many people who experience that.</p>
<p>And in fact, a lot of people think that,</p>
<p>well, this may be the way I sleep.</p>
<p>Maybe I am not designed to sleep restoratively</p>
<p>until I sleep one day, just like the camping trip.</p>
<p>And then they realize what it feels like</p>
<p>to be haphazardly asleep.</p>
<p>What you are missing, yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that we talk about</p>
<p>the other aspect of fire, which is you had a paper</p>
<p>that came out recently, very interesting paper,</p>
<p>studying firefighters and time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>in firefighters.</p>
<p>Would you share with us the general contour</p>
<p>and maybe even some of the specifics of that study?</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>for sake of shift workers, but for everybody really</p>
<p>to understand these results.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s go back to shift workers</p>
<p>because this also relates to all of us</p>
<p>because I always say that each of us is a shift worker</p>
<p>or has lived the life of a shift worker.</p>
<p>And we have experienced how terrible, difficult it is.</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s start with what is the definition</p>
<p>of a shift worker or shift work-like lifestyle?</p>
<p>There is no universal definition, unfortunately,</p>
<p>but there are many European countries,</p>
<p>and particularly if you go</p>
<p>to international labor organization,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll find some references.</p>
<p>Different European countries</p>
<p>have slightly different definition,</p>
<p>which essentially points to,</p>
<p>if you stay awake for two or more hours</p>
<p>during your habitual sleep time,</p>
<p>and when they say habitual sleep time,</p>
<p>they assume that we are, just like you said,</p>
<p>we are kind of programmed to sleep</p>
<p>somewhere between, say, 10 p.m.</p>
<p>and then stay in bed and kind of wake up after 5 a.m.</p>
<p>So the idea is if you&rsquo;re staying awake</p>
<p>for two or more hours between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>and you are engaged in some activity,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s physical activity or intellectual activity,</p>
<p>you are not lying in bed and wondering,</p>
<p>worrying about something, but actually working.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s defined as shift work,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to do it every single day.</p>
<p>Even if you do it once a week for 50 weeks,</p>
<p>then that itself is enough to disrupt your physiology</p>
<p>and metabolism, behavior, brain function,</p>
<p>like a shift worker.</p>
<p>The reason is, as we discussed,</p>
<p>when you change our external timing cue,</p>
<p>so in this case, when you travel jet lag</p>
<p>or traveling across three days,</p>
<p>three hours of jet lag will take three days to reset.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you&rsquo;re staying awake for two hours extra,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re waking up two hours</p>
<p>before your habitual wake-up time,</p>
<p>then we just don&rsquo;t wake up</p>
<p>and then be engaged in some activity in the dark.</p>
<p>Most of us, unless you are wearing infrared goggles,</p>
<p>we turn on light, and light resets our clock.</p>
<p>So in that way, every time we stay up</p>
<p>for two or more hours, even for one night,</p>
<p>then for the next two nights,</p>
<p>our clock is kind of trying to catch up.</p>
<p>So in that way, for three days,</p>
<p>the day of the disruption,</p>
<p>and then two days following the disruption,</p>
<p>our clock is trying to catch up with the outside time.</p>
<p>So our body is not on time with our clock.</p>
<p>So that means almost for half of the week</p>
<p>or half of the year, our clock is trying to catch up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the definition of shift work.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s come back</p>
<p>to Department of Labor Statistics, U.S. government.</p>
<p>They have not been tracking</p>
<p>what percentage of people are doing shift work accurately,</p>
<p>because there are many difficulties in tracking too.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s generally accepted</p>
<p>that one in five working adults</p>
<p>is a card-carrying shift worker.</p>
<p>Card-carrying shift workers means they are nurses,</p>
<p>doctors, firefighters,</p>
<p>and bakers, truck drivers,</p>
<p>and many in the service industry.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one in five.</p>
<p>So 20% of working adults.</p>
<p>Then if we think about all the college students,</p>
<p>just like I was doing, and you must have done,</p>
<p>there are also-</p>
<p>Deadlines, granted deadlines.</p>
<p>Granted deadlines.</p>
<p>Then we are also experiencing</p>
<p>the lifestyle of a shift worker,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re delaying sleep.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re delaying sleep by two hours</p>
<p>for most of the college students for five days,</p>
<p>and then the weekend you&rsquo;re trying to catch up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a circadian disruption going on.</p>
<p>Then you take 1.5 or 1.6 million new moms</p>
<p>in the U.S. every year.</p>
<p>So when the child is born,</p>
<p>then that mother is a shift worker.</p>
<p>Actually, that mother is worse than a shift worker</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know what time of the night</p>
<p>the baby will wake up and how many times,</p>
<p>and there is no weekend in motherhood.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re also living the life of a shift worker.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t count many food delivery and Uber driver,</p>
<p>Lyft drivers as shift workers,</p>
<p>but many of them we know that they live.</p>
<p>So in that way, we think the actual number of people</p>
<p>who are experiencing the life of a shift worker</p>
<p>is somewhere around 50% of the adult&rsquo;s population</p>
<p>at any given time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s also another point</p>
<p>that you might have heard from people.</p>
<p>They will say, oh, I cannot do time-restricted eating</p>
<p>because my schedule is messed up,</p>
<p>or I work in a different way,</p>
<p>and that comes into play.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we thought,</p>
<p>okay, so we should try something on shift worker.</p>
<p>Another point is although one in five people</p>
<p>are shift workers,</p>
<p>they carry disproportionately heavier burden of disease</p>
<p>because almost all age-related disease</p>
<p>that we can think of, whether it&rsquo;s high blood pressure,</p>
<p>usually high blood pressure starts in 40s or 50s,</p>
<p>high cholesterol, gastrointestinal problem, indigestion,</p>
<p>chronic inflammation of the colon,</p>
<p>and then even colon cancer in many cases.</p>
<p>And then, of course, diabetes,</p>
<p>all of these are disproportionately more prevalent</p>
<p>among shift workers.</p>
<p>But then when you think about clinical trials,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a drug or a lifestyle,</p>
<p>often one of the top 10 exclusion factor criteria</p>
<p>is shift work.</p>
<p>So people who are doing shift work,</p>
<p>we exclude them from many of these trials.</p>
<p>One thing is most physicians and most scientists,</p>
<p>even people who do shift work,</p>
<p>they know that their body and mind is so messed up</p>
<p>that oftentimes even medications may not help them.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t try a new medication.</p>
<p>Why to take the risk when we know it may not help them?</p>
<p>And then when it comes to lifestyle intervention,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s sleep extension, for example,</p>
<p>we cannot do because they are supposed to stay awake</p>
<p>and do their job.</p>
<p>We cannot ask them to stay asleep at night.</p>
<p>And then physical activity and exercise,</p>
<p>some people can do,</p>
<p>but some people are so tired after all night</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have the energy to do physical activity.</p>
<p>And then nutrition, again, most nutrition studies</p>
<p>involve the participants to come to the clinic</p>
<p>and get one-on-one or attend group sessions,</p>
<p>and they cannot come.</p>
<p>And they cannot even sometimes come to the clinic visit</p>
<p>when people have to draw blood.</p>
<p>And in fact, there is another caveat that just if,</p>
<p>suppose I&rsquo;m healthy,</p>
<p>I have perfectly normal blood pressure,</p>
<p>blood glucose, cholesterol, everything is normal.</p>
<p>And I live the life of a shift worker just for five nights.</p>
<p>That means I&rsquo;m sleeping less, maybe four or five hours.</p>
<p>And even if I don&rsquo;t eat at nighttime,</p>
<p>of course, many shift workers also feel hungry</p>
<p>and just to keep their work, they eat.</p>
<p>Just after five days, my blood glucose level</p>
<p>will read almost like I&rsquo;m pre-diabetic.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I actually saw a study in published in Proceedings</p>
<p>of the National Academy</p>
<p>that showed that even a hundred lux dim light</p>
<p>present in the room while people are sleeping</p>
<p>with eyes closed can lead to disruptions</p>
<p>in morning blood glucose levels</p>
<p>in directions that are not good one night.</p>
<p>So the faint clock in the corner</p>
<p>or even a nightlight that&rsquo;s too bright</p>
<p>could be problematic.</p>
<p>By the way, folks, these effects are reversible.</p>
<p>So whenever I say these things,</p>
<p>we get a lot of comments about,</p>
<p>oh my goodness, what have I been doing for years?</p>
<p>Kids with nightlights, this is an issue.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m hearing is that one in five people</p>
<p>are truly shift workers in the classic sense.</p>
<p>Their jobs require they work at night</p>
<p>or into the night and sleep into the day.</p>
<p>But far more people are shift workers</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact that they&rsquo;re tweeting</p>
<p>or working or watching movies at night,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s not work</p>
<p>in that they&rsquo;re not being paid for that time.</p>
<p>They are essentially operating like shift workers.</p>
<p>If we add those two groups together,</p>
<p>would we say it&rsquo;s what, a third of Americans?</p>
<p>I would say half of Americans.</p>
<p>Half of Americans.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you take teenagers,</p>
<p>because high school students and college students,</p>
<p>because again, going back to Horacio&rsquo;s study,</p>
<p>because Horacio also collected activity data</p>
<p>from high school students and college students,</p>
<p>and we have replicated that with high school students</p>
<p>and college students in San Diego.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Seattle and San Diego.</p>
<p>And this study, now there are many sleep researchers</p>
<p>that have been collecting this data.</p>
<p>And what we find is typically the high school students,</p>
<p>they are going to bed say around midnight</p>
<p>and college students, at least the UCSD students,</p>
<p>we found maybe one out of 100</p>
<p>who went to bed before midnight.</p>
<p>That reminds me that Horacio Iglesias</p>
<p>just published this really nice paper</p>
<p>showing that counter to what we believe,</p>
<p>now this is the University of Washington in Seattle,</p>
<p>I should mention, where it&rsquo;s very dark in the winter.</p>
<p>Young people, these are people in their 20s,</p>
<p>are staying up later in the winter months</p>
<p>compared to the summer months.</p>
<p>Which is totally counterintuitive.</p>
<p>You think, okay, everyone stays up late in the summer</p>
<p>and goes to bed early in the winter,</p>
<p>but because of artificial lighting, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Yeah, so another, I don&rsquo;t know whether Horacio monitored it,</p>
<p>but my other suspicion, I&rsquo;m not saying whether it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>in winter, we are more likely to consume more coffee,</p>
<p>hot chocolate in the evening,</p>
<p>and that might also be delaying sleep onset.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>So in that way, again, here is another thing</p>
<p>which can be related to policy</p>
<p>or practice at Educational Institute.</p>
<p>So what happened during COVID</p>
<p>was everybody went to remote learning.</p>
<p>The assignments became digital</p>
<p>and assignment submission became digital.</p>
<p>And there are many systems, online systems,</p>
<p>that came into play.</p>
<p>And by default, the assignment submission deadline</p>
<p>became midnight.</p>
<p>So then now what is happening is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about Stanford,</p>
<p>maybe when you are giving assignment,</p>
<p>what is the deadline?</p>
<p>Midnight, typically.</p>
<p>Midnight.</p>
<p>So then most of us, most students,</p>
<p>they will try to cram as much as possible,</p>
<p>try to solve as much as possible,</p>
<p>and submit at midnight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be really cool to go back</p>
<p>to your system administrator to see,</p>
<p>is there so many frequency plot of,</p>
<p>frequency distribution of what time</p>
<p>people are submitting their assignment.</p>
<p>Because we know, when we submit our grant.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, you hear about the obesity crisis,</p>
<p>the crisis of metabolic disorders,</p>
<p>not just in the US, but everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really striking.</p>
<p>I remember going to a Keystone meeting,</p>
<p>scientific meeting in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>And there was a map of the United States</p>
<p>and it showed where the obesity rates</p>
<p>were over 30% in adults.</p>
<p>And the entire country basically was lighting up like crazy.</p>
<p>Now it would be the entire country.</p>
<p>But there were these kind of zones in the middle</p>
<p>that were almost devoid of obesity.</p>
<p>Colorado, namely, Idaho at that time.</p>
<p>Those are now also fallen under the umbrella</p>
<p>of rampant obesity.</p>
<p>And everyone is speculating,</p>
<p>okay, is it seed oils?</p>
<p>Is it this, is it that?</p>
<p>Is it highly processed foods?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s all of those things,</p>
<p>including lack of activity.</p>
<p>But one has to wonder,</p>
<p>given everything we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in terms of metabolic dysfunction,</p>
<p>late shifted eating, all these issues</p>
<p>with late shifted eating</p>
<p>and staying up late with artificial lighting,</p>
<p>whether or not that could be one of the major factors</p>
<p>in the so-called obesity crisis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely, you know, we call it a freshman 15.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>These kids are gaining 15 pounds</p>
<p>in their freshman year in college.</p>
<p>And this is where I think as educator or professors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be interesting to go back and see what can we do?</p>
<p>Because another thing that&rsquo;s also becoming</p>
<p>more and more common,</p>
<p>for example, I give a circadian rhythm class,</p>
<p>means I just give two lectures.</p>
<p>And I remember when I started 15, 17 years ago,</p>
<p>that lecture used to be around 1.30 p.m.</p>
<p>or 2.00 p.m. in the afternoon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a two and a half hour lecture.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s done by five.</p>
<p>And for the last, before the pandemic,</p>
<p>I realized that they changed the timing.</p>
<p>Now the lecture was starting at 7.00 p.m.</p>
<p>So I was finishing by 9.00, 9.30 p.m.</p>
<p>And these kids, they had to go and eat after 9.30.</p>
<p>Study, socialize.</p>
<p>Study, socialize.</p>
<p>Fireside chat.</p>
<p>Fireside chat.</p>
<p>And then to express themselves,</p>
<p>like to feel free from assignments.</p>
<p>When are they going to do that?</p>
<p>After they submit the assignment,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re going to do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we had to go back and revisit this issue.</p>
<p>Say, okay, so for adults,</p>
<p>for most of us who are working a day job,</p>
<p>our deadline is 5.00 p.m. in most cases.</p>
<p>Means at least in university system,</p>
<p>the person who is submitting the grant</p>
<p>who is taking care of my IRB or IACUC,</p>
<p>they are all leaving at 5.00.</p>
<p>So for me, everything has to end by five.</p>
<p>I think for most people out there.</p>
<p>So this raises a kind of macroscopic question,</p>
<p>which is maybe it&rsquo;s not so much</p>
<p>about restricting the feeding window,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s about feeding mostly and being active</p>
<p>mostly in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>I mean, I could imagine a time three, four years from now</p>
<p>when waking up early and going to bed</p>
<p>within three hours of sunset is the protocol</p>
<p>which harnesses all other protocols, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do it in that time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to eat, you&rsquo;re going to do it in that time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to socialize, you&rsquo;re going to do it in that time.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you&rsquo;re also avoiding a lot of the issues</p>
<p>related to disrupted sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why all these things, as you said,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding is just one aspect</p>
<p>of the circadian health and these are all interconnected.</p>
<p>And going back to the comment</p>
<p>about within three hours of sunset, yes, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But then what happens in say Toronto</p>
<p>or Vancouver in wintertime?</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;re going to bed very, very early,</p>
<p>but also waking up very, very early.</p>
<p>You know, one of the things that I hear all the time,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m always beating on the drum</p>
<p>of getting morning sunlight, even if through cloud cover,</p>
<p>is people say, there&rsquo;s no sun here this time of year.</p>
<p>And forgive me, but there is sun, unless you live in a cave,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sun, it&rsquo;s just coming through cloud cover.</p>
<p>No matter where you live in the world, there&rsquo;s sun,</p>
<p>unless you live in a cave, of course.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that we didn&rsquo;t overlook,</p>
<p>what was the major conclusion of the firefighter study?</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ll go back to the firefighter study.</p>
<p>So the reason why we did this study was, as I said,</p>
<p>there are a lot of us who are living the lifestyle</p>
<p>of firefighters or shift workers,</p>
<p>and shift workers are excluded from studies.</p>
<p>So that means whatever we are learning about lifestyle</p>
<p>or even medications that may be beneficial for people</p>
<p>who actually have a normal schedule,</p>
<p>but not for people who have a disrupted schedule.</p>
<p>And if you look up clinicaltrial.gov,</p>
<p>there are more than 400,000 studies listed.</p>
<p>And if you search how many studies are on shift workers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less than a thousand.</p>
<p>And then if you ask, most of them are to see</p>
<p>what is wrong with shift workers.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s how we know that shift work increases our risk</p>
<p>for metabolic disease, cancer,</p>
<p>and even some aspects of dementia.</p>
<p>But if you ask how many studies are done</p>
<p>to improve the health of shift worker alone,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s less than 50.</p>
<p>Means I have to go back and check the actual number,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s less than 50.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we got super excited.</p>
<p>We thought from circadian rhythm perspective,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something to address.</p>
<p>So this study, again, this kind of study is only possible</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m at Salk and we are affiliated with UCSD</p>
<p>and I can work with UCSD physicians to do this study.</p>
<p>So I collaborate with Dr. Pam Taub,</p>
<p>who is the Director of Cardiac Rehab Center in UCSD.</p>
<p>And Pam has many firefighters as her patients.</p>
<p>And we both know that the number one cause</p>
<p>for death and disability on work for firefighters</p>
<p>is not fighting fire,</p>
<p>but just getting heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>So they have a very high incidence</p>
<p>of heart attack and stroke,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re also highly prone to different kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>And it may be difficult to ascribe cancer to disruption,</p>
<p>circadian disruption,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re also exposed to a lot of toxins.</p>
<p>Anytime fire burns,</p>
<p>that smell of fire is essentially smell of carcinogens</p>
<p>and their breathing,</p>
<p>even if they have the hood on and respirator,</p>
<p>they still get.</p>
<p>So the idea was very simple.</p>
<p>We know that firefighters,</p>
<p>nearly 70% of firefighters in the US,</p>
<p>full-time firefighters,</p>
<p>because there are volunteer firefighters</p>
<p>and then full-time firefighters.</p>
<p>The full-time firefighters,</p>
<p>70% of them work 24 hours shift.</p>
<p>So for example, in San Diego,</p>
<p>they come in at their shift is from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m.</p>
<p>the next day.</p>
<p>And they do, at least in San Diego,</p>
<p>they do one day on, one day off, on, off,</p>
<p>four cycles and then four days off.</p>
<p>And, but in some fire departments,</p>
<p>they actually do 48 hour shift.</p>
<p>So they come for two days, two days off,</p>
<p>two days, two days off,</p>
<p>and then four or five days off.</p>
<p>Brutal.</p>
<p>Thank you, firefighters.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so then the idea was, okay,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll screen firefighters</p>
<p>and then find firefighters who are metabolically unhealthy.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll see whether they can actually follow</p>
<p>10 hours time-restricted eating.</p>
<p>Because the point is, if firefighters can follow it,</p>
<p>then everybody else should be because,</p>
<p>with all that stress, if they can.</p>
<p>And this is again,</p>
<p>where I should also acknowledge</p>
<p>the San Diego Fire and Rescue Department,</p>
<p>because without their help,</p>
<p>we could not have even submitted the grant.</p>
<p>And at that time, David Picon,</p>
<p>who is their health and wellness battalion chief,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the one who actually approached us.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s very careful.</p>
<p>He knew that the job that they do</p>
<p>makes them weaker in long-term</p>
<p>and can kill them in long-term.</p>
<p>So he was always looking for new solutions.</p>
<p>So he approached us and then we said, this is the idea.</p>
<p>He said, well, I love this idea</p>
<p>because we are not asking them to sleep more</p>
<p>or we are not going to cut down their overtime</p>
<p>or shift or change the work schedule.</p>
<p>The only thing we&rsquo;ll be doing</p>
<p>is ask them to eat within 10 hours.</p>
<p>And hopefully we can do this.</p>
<p>Consistently between the days</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re working and not working?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that means if they&rsquo;re from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m. working,</p>
<p>then the next day, then they go home,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re gonna eat on the same schedule they did</p>
<p>when they were at the fire house, but while at home.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not allowing themselves to deviate from that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we thought whether they can do it or not,</p>
<p>because the number one goal or the primary outcome</p>
<p>in this clinical trial was feasibility.</p>
<p>Can they do it?</p>
<p>And then second was, if they do it,</p>
<p>then what happens to their blood sugar and weight</p>
<p>and all this other stuff?</p>
<p>And then we started the study and we hit the next hurdle.</p>
<p>And that is, firefighters are a very tight-knit community.</p>
<p>Very tight-knit community.</p>
<p>And they want to make sure</p>
<p>that you understand their culture.</p>
<p>And the best way to understand their culture</p>
<p>is to live the life of a firefighter.</p>
<p>So Emily Manoogian, who is the first author,</p>
<p>she and then we had Adina Jadurian,</p>
<p>who is now in med school.</p>
<p>She was a research coordinator at that time.</p>
<p>They volunteered, they said,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;ll go to the busiest fire station in San Diego</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll live the life of a firefighter.</p>
<p>And the San Diego Fire and Rescue and the city,</p>
<p>they all agreed, they reported for duty</p>
<p>at 7.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>They were assigned a bed in the station</p>
<p>because all fire stations do have some beds</p>
<p>for firefighters to rest and they have assigned beds,</p>
<p>so they were assigned a bed.</p>
<p>Yeah, so every time a 911 call came,</p>
<p>and if that fire station,</p>
<p>and that fire station, that fire engine was called,</p>
<p>then just like other firefighters,</p>
<p>they had to run, get into the gears,</p>
<p>adjust the shoes and a jacket and a helmet</p>
<p>and get into the seat and attend the call.</p>
<p>Of course, they won&rsquo;t go to the side,</p>
<p>they just get out of the truck,</p>
<p>wait there, then come back.</p>
<p>So in that 24 hours, Emily got 10 calls at night</p>
<p>that she had to run to,</p>
<p>but there are more than 10 times,</p>
<p>they got the 911, every time the 911 call came,</p>
<p>then there is a beep that goes out.</p>
<p>All firefighters were sleeping or resting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get up, or if they&rsquo;re doing something,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll look up to see which engine is called.</p>
<p>Interesting, so it&rsquo;s not just the ones that go out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everyone gets woken up.</p>
<p>Everyone gets woken up.</p>
<p>So that means in a night, typical night,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re waking up 10, 15, 20 times sometimes.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re almost like, you know,</p>
<p>new moms are like firefighters</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>what time the baby will cry</p>
<p>and for what reason also, they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So similarly, so that&rsquo;s what Emily did.</p>
<p>And then next morning, once she came back,</p>
<p>she was like, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grad school, seem easy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So then we did the study</p>
<p>and we essentially assigned all the firefighters,</p>
<p>we recruited 150 firefighters.</p>
<p>We assigned half of them to Mediterranean diet</p>
<p>because you cannot do any harm,</p>
<p>you have to give them something good.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>They said, no, we want something</p>
<p>that we know works for firefighters.</p>
<p>And there was a Mediterranean diet study, so.</p>
<p>So everybody was supposed to follow Mediterranean diet</p>
<p>and then half, nearly 75 of them</p>
<p>were supposed to eat within 10 hours.</p>
<p>We did not fix the 10 hours</p>
<p>because we said you pick your own 10 hours</p>
<p>that you can stick to.</p>
<p>But it has to be consistent from day to day.</p>
<p>So if you start eating at 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>you finish it at, you know, at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>And then try to be, yeah, try to be consistent</p>
<p>because we said, yes, we understand</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;ll be some things</p>
<p>and you can take maybe half an hour here and there</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see how many times you can do it.</p>
<p>And what is interesting</p>
<p>was although they were all doing 24 hour shift,</p>
<p>they more or less chose to begin eating</p>
<p>somewhere between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.</p>
<p>And they did not skip any meal.</p>
<p>They had their first meal or what we call breakfast,</p>
<p>but it was several hours after waking up</p>
<p>because they are waking up at five or six</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re driving to come to work at 7.30 or eight</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re eating their first meal,</p>
<p>say between eight and 11.</p>
<p>And then the finished meal 10 hours later.</p>
<p>And what we found is more or less</p>
<p>most of them could stick to doing this</p>
<p>at least five days out of seven days.</p>
<p>And then at the end of the study,</p>
<p>when we look at their health parameters,</p>
<p>one thing that I said, we recruited everybody who can.</p>
<p>So that means nearly one in three firefighters</p>
<p>were completely healthy.</p>
<p>They had no sign of any illness,</p>
<p>no high blood pressure, high blood sugar,</p>
<p>high cholesterol, depression or anything.</p>
<p>So since we have one third of the population</p>
<p>who are already healthy</p>
<p>and then everybody has slightly different conditions.</p>
<p>Some have high blood pressure,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have high blood glucose.</p>
<p>If somebody has high blood glucose,</p>
<p>but not high blood pressure.</p>
<p>So it was kind of heterogeneous.</p>
<p>So we did not see big difference in weight loss</p>
<p>or any weight change between these two groups.</p>
<p>Another thing is the firefighters actually run</p>
<p>almost eight to nine miles when they&rsquo;re at the job</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s part of their exercise routine.</p>
<p>But then one thing that changed significantly</p>
<p>in the time-restricted eating group</p>
<p>was what we call VLDL particle size and particle number</p>
<p>because this is something that we know</p>
<p>is very low density lipoprotein.</p>
<p>These are atherogenic.</p>
<p>And if we can manage them much better,</p>
<p>then we reduce the risk for atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one parameter that changed</p>
<p>in the time-restricted eating group.</p>
<p>Even when you combine all healthy, unhealthy, everybody.</p>
<p>Now, if we take firefighters</p>
<p>who were beginning with high blood pressure,</p>
<p>then we saw a significant reduction in their systolic</p>
<p>as well as diastolic blood pressure.</p>
<p>And the change in blood pressure,</p>
<p>of course, we don&rsquo;t claim that in the manuscript,</p>
<p>but when we talk about it,</p>
<p>some physician would get up and say,</p>
<p>wow, that looks like almost they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on a blood pressure lowering drug.</p>
<p>So the extent of blood pressure lowering</p>
<p>is equivalent to somebody taking a antihypertensive drug.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then those who started with high blood sugar,</p>
<p>of course, we didn&rsquo;t have too many type two diabetic,</p>
<p>but there are a few pre-diabetic</p>
<p>and they could better manage their blood glucose.</p>
<p>And this is interesting because once shift workers</p>
<p>become pre-diabetic or diabetic,</p>
<p>they have more difficulty managing their blood sugar</p>
<p>than non-shift workers</p>
<p>because the work schedule itself</p>
<p>will mess them up too much.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re on many medication, they have difficulty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really glad that you explained the study</p>
<p>in such detail,</p>
<p>because I would have thought from reading the abstract,</p>
<p>and I did look at the data,</p>
<p>but if someone were to look at the abstract,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d say, oh, firefighters,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re throwing on their gear</p>
<p>and going out to calls and do it.</p>
<p>But if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>all firefighters are being woken up by the signal,</p>
<p>which makes the firefighter population</p>
<p>a bit more similar to the more standard population</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>getting on social media for a couple of minutes</p>
<p>or flipping on the lights.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s maybe not as severe</p>
<p>as what firefighters are doing,</p>
<p>but we know there are blood sugar regulation issues</p>
<p>related to those multiple middle of the night wakings,</p>
<p>especially if people are then staring at screens.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that people were able to hear</p>
<p>about the deeper contours of the study.</p>
<p>I mean, this result of regulating blood sugar better</p>
<p>is really powerful.</p>
<p>I get asked all the time, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a new kid or I&rsquo;m a shift worker.</p>
<p>How can I do this morning sunlight viewing?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m hearing is that</p>
<p>keeping a regular meal schedule every day.</p>
<p>At least five out of seven.</p>
<p>Five out of seven, or as close to every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like sleep.</p>
<p>I always say, try and get a really great night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>80% or more of the nights of your life.</p>
<p>And on the other 20%, hopefully it&rsquo;s for fun reasons,</p>
<p>a great party or something like that,</p>
<p>or a celebration of some sort.</p>
<p>That seems to me a great anchor point</p>
<p>when one can&rsquo;t reliably control their sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>Does that mean that if somebody is coming off of shift work</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very, very tired,</p>
<p>that they would be better off staying awake and eating</p>
<p>than sleeping?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so this is where we get into nuances.</p>
<p>So here, the firefighters are 24-hour shift workers.</p>
<p>So that means, and they have been working the shift</p>
<p>for a very long time, so they have figured out.</p>
<p>And one thing is, yes, firefighters are different</p>
<p>from nurses and healthcare workers</p>
<p>who have to work throughout the night</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re staying awake throughout the night.</p>
<p>Whereas firefighters, they get opportunity to sleep.</p>
<p>Then even with their pen calls,</p>
<p>they actually have opportunity to come back and go to sleep.</p>
<p>And in fact, when Emily and Adina,</p>
<p>when they were in the fire station,</p>
<p>what they observed was firefighters,</p>
<p>after attending a call,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not coming back and playing cards</p>
<p>or trying to watch the news or get the score.</p>
<p>They know, they will just go back and lie in the bed</p>
<p>and switch off the light.</p>
<p>So whenever they got any opportunity to sleep,</p>
<p>they would try to sleep.</p>
<p>So in that way, their sleep debt and sleep pressure</p>
<p>during daytime is not as strong as a night shift nurse.</p>
<p>Or a truck driver who is driving all night</p>
<p>because they are staying awake throughout the night.</p>
<p>So when people say, yes, you found this</p>
<p>and can you extend it to other shift workers?</p>
<p>My answer is no, we have to go back and figure out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we went to the station</p>
<p>and figured out what would work for them.</p>
<p>If I have to go and do this for some nurses,</p>
<p>maybe even I will go or our staff will go and figure out</p>
<p>what is their work schedule?</p>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>Do they have opportunity to eat?</p>
<p>Do they have opportunity to even take five minutes break?</p>
<p>What do they do during break?</p>
<p>And all of these things come into play.</p>
<p>But here, another thing is,</p>
<p>I always said that in other time-restricted feeding paper,</p>
<p>we see change in nutrition quality and quantity.</p>
<p>But here, we also saw that somehow both groups</p>
<p>inadvertently, they improved their nutrition quality</p>
<p>because everybody was told to eat Mediterranean diet.</p>
<p>They increased their fruits and vegetables</p>
<p>and olive oil intakes slightly.</p>
<p>And when they had to stop eating early,</p>
<p>they also reduced their alcohol intake.</p>
<p>And this is very significant because many shift workers,</p>
<p>just to cope with the shift work,</p>
<p>they tend to depend on alcohol at night</p>
<p>and caffeine in the morning.</p>
<p>So they begin their day with caffeine and end with alcohol.</p>
<p>And now we can relate that many normal people</p>
<p>who are not doing shift work,</p>
<p>we also more or less begin our day with caffeine</p>
<p>and many of us end with alcohol.</p>
<p>And then when they reduce that eating to 10 hours,</p>
<p>and then we saw a significant reduction in alcohol intake</p>
<p>in the time-restricted eating group,</p>
<p>but not in the standard of care or Mediterranean diet group.</p>
<p>I certainly support that.</p>
<p>We did an episode on alcohol and I was shocked</p>
<p>when I researched that to learn that zero</p>
<p>to two drinks per week is essentially the threshold</p>
<p>beyond which you start seeing health deficits</p>
<p>in particular cancers and metabolic disruption,</p>
<p>sleep disruption, and increased anxiety</p>
<p>when people aren&rsquo;t under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty incredible how alcohol</p>
<p>has kind of escaped as the opposite of caffeine</p>
<p>and therefore not a health hazard.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m somebody, I have a drink every once in a while,</p>
<p>no big deal for me, I can have it or not have it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just striking how alcohol,</p>
<p>despite extensive data that it can really disrupt health</p>
<p>even at three drinks per week is just avidly consumed</p>
<p>as if it was kind of like food or caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>I wanna make sure that I circle back</p>
<p>to something you mentioned earlier</p>
<p>because I know there are going to be a number of people</p>
<p>that ask this.</p>
<p>If I recall, you said that provided</p>
<p>that the feeding window is not shorter than eight hours</p>
<p>that men, women, and children</p>
<p>can use time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so what I say is 12 hours.</p>
<p>Excuse me, 12 hours.</p>
<p>Thank you for that clarification.</p>
<p>Because we did a study that was published in 2015.</p>
<p>And again, behind many of our studies, there is a story.</p>
<p>So we are publishing all these mouse stories</p>
<p>and then I would go to conferences.</p>
<p>And then, of course, some people would give me a look</p>
<p>saying, well, you must be doing something wrong.</p>
<p>This just breaks the X law of thermodynamics</p>
<p>because how come they&rsquo;re eating the same number of calories</p>
<p>and not gaining weight?</p>
<p>Of course, by that time, we figured out that,</p>
<p>at least in mouse, time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>also changes the gut microbiome in a way</p>
<p>that the mice may be pooping out a little bit more fat</p>
<p>and sugar than absorbing them.</p>
<p>So one thing that happens in time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>at least in mice, is their liver cholesterol metabolism</p>
<p>to bile acid and bile acid excretion in the gut changes</p>
<p>because the gut microbiome changes.</p>
<p>So this is a very nice study.</p>
<p>When Amir Jarinpar was in the lab,</p>
<p>now he has his own lab in UCSD,</p>
<p>and he meticulously did that.</p>
<p>And we even did bum calorimetry from the poop</p>
<p>and metabolomics from the poop.</p>
<p>And then we figured out that they excrete some calories</p>
<p>and then their brown fat activity goes up.</p>
<p>So they may be burning some of these extra calories.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re more thermogenic.</p>
<p>More thermogenic.</p>
<p>But anyway, so one nice thing, awesome thing about Salk</p>
<p>is if they see that your science is going well,</p>
<p>then they will find ways to help you.</p>
<p>And this is-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is when Bill Brody was our president.</p>
<p>He was the president of Hopkins for 12 years</p>
<p>and then he was president.</p>
<p>And that time he had started this innovation grant program,</p>
<p>which was funded by Orwin Jacob.</p>
<p>Orwin is the founder of Qualcomm.</p>
<p>And he was also a faculty at UCSD.</p>
<p>So he understands there are very few tech leaders</p>
<p>who actually spend some time in academia.</p>
<p>So he understood the pain of getting grant money</p>
<p>when you have some interesting idea or test some ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, no knock on the NIH, but I&rsquo;ll do it anyway.</p>
<p>Because I sit on study section for the NIH.</p>
<p>I mean, the NIH wants to see proposals</p>
<p>for things that are so certain to work</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re mostly done.</p>
<p>And so really groundbreaking work can happen</p>
<p>and does happen with NIH funding,</p>
<p>but more often than not,</p>
<p>it is the generosity of philanthropists like Orwin Jacobs</p>
<p>and other people that allow the really pioneering,</p>
<p>the new stuff, the cool stuff, the groundbreaking stuff,</p>
<p>the stuff that really, no, I&rsquo;m not gonna say really matters.</p>
<p>It all matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all important.</p>
<p>No, it matters, but it&rsquo;s high risk.</p>
<p>And NIH means NIH is not just government</p>
<p>is not making money from thin air.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
<p>So there is a little bit responsibility or conservative</p>
<p>that, okay, so we should not waste taxpayers&rsquo; money</p>
<p>on pie-in-the-sky kind of project too much.</p>
<p>To be clear, we&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about politically conservative.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about scientifically conservative.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be so careful with language nowadays.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, we&rsquo;re just gonna sit and stare at one another</p>
<p>at the microphones to stay safe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So then we started this.</p>
<p>And then what we did was we,</p>
<p>I had an awesome grad student</p>
<p>and we got this funding from Irwin.</p>
<p>And also there are some, any philanthropy matters.</p>
<p>So actually the way we say is, yes,</p>
<p>if you give me 50 bucks,</p>
<p>then that 50 bucks goes towards buying the gloves</p>
<p>and a friend of tubes for one postdoc for maybe seven days.</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that 99% of laboratory scientists,</p>
<p>just they don&rsquo;t make any money off their discoveries.</p>
<p>And even if there is a patentable discovery,</p>
<p>typically the divide between the institution</p>
<p>and the company that will eventually put that to market</p>
<p>is so slim in favor of the others involved</p>
<p>that scientists really do this as a work of passion,</p>
<p>labor of love.</p>
<p>So we came up with this app, MyCKDnClock at that time.</p>
<p>And we took some lessons from tech leaders,</p>
<p>particularly from Amazon One Click Checkout,</p>
<p>because we thought most nutrition apps</p>
<p>actually ask people to detail, describe what they ate,</p>
<p>go to their food library and then portion size.</p>
<p>We said, okay, so we&rsquo;ll just shortcut all of that.</p>
<p>We just ask people to take a picture of the food,</p>
<p>open the app, one click,</p>
<p>take a picture, second click,</p>
<p>and press save, third click.</p>
<p>And when they saved, the picture actually came to our server,</p>
<p>did not stay on their phone.</p>
<p>And we asked 156 people who are not shift workers,</p>
<p>just regular worker or homemakers,</p>
<p>to be part of the study.</p>
<p>No student was allowed to be part of the study</p>
<p>because we know that their lifestyle is like shift workers.</p>
<p>And we monitored for three weeks.</p>
<p>And so here is some nuances,</p>
<p>and I want people to understand.</p>
<p>So suppose when somebody is starting to eat</p>
<p>at say 7 a.m. and since they&rsquo;re recording everything,</p>
<p>we caught every single thing.</p>
<p>Even if they ate half a cookie,</p>
<p>they had to take a picture,</p>
<p>and they actually took picture because it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it becomes second nature after three or four days</p>
<p>that every time they ate something,</p>
<p>even if there was a glass of water,</p>
<p>they actually took a picture because we asked them,</p>
<p>take picture of everything, we&rsquo;ll figure out what it is.</p>
<p>What is surprising was we found the median,</p>
<p>so the median number of times people eat</p>
<p>within a day, 24 hours a day, is actually seven.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that we are eating three times a day,</p>
<p>we actually snack a little bit.</p>
<p>Seven times per day.</p>
<p>Seven times.</p>
<p>And there are 10% of people,</p>
<p>the top decile was eating 12 times a day.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And it makes sense in retrospect sometimes,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll fall into that seven or eight</p>
<p>before I did this study.</p>
<p>Getting up, having coffee with cream and sugar is one,</p>
<p>and then I ate my breakfast, that&rsquo;s two,</p>
<p>then I came to the lab and I found that cookie,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s three.</p>
<p>I went to a meeting and there was some cookie</p>
<p>and something else, that&rsquo;s another one,</p>
<p>then lunch, and then afternoon somebody asked me</p>
<p>to go out and have a meeting.</p>
<p>So if you think about it, it&rsquo;s very normal</p>
<p>that we can go seven to eight times, 10 times.</p>
<p>But then, if we look at what time, say I start breakfast,</p>
<p>and as I said, we see that in many people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll start at seven o&rsquo;clock one day,</p>
<p>then 7.30 another day, then 8.15 another day,</p>
<p>or they go back to 6 a.m. because they had to get up early</p>
<p>and go to work.</p>
<p>So we took all these food data from three weeks</p>
<p>and then asked, what is the time when your body&rsquo;s system</p>
<p>is expecting it to eat?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s kind of averages out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of thinking, okay, maybe for you,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re eating breakfast at say somewhere</p>
<p>between 6 a.m., 7.30, 7.45, 8,</p>
<p>maybe you are expecting food around seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s forget about 6.15, that&rsquo;s an outlier.</p>
<p>And then similarly, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if somebody is eating, finishing the last bite</p>
<p>or the night gap, whatever you call it,</p>
<p>say one at 9 p.m., 9.30 p.m., 10, 11, 12.30, or one,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s ignore that one and 12.30,</p>
<p>but still we got somewhere between seven to 11.30</p>
<p>for that person over three weeks time.</p>
<p>So this is how we kind of figure out</p>
<p>what is the likelihood that your body will encounter food.</p>
<p>So when we do that, what we found was nearly 50% of adults</p>
<p>in our study ate for 14 hours, 45 minutes,</p>
<p>that window when your body is expecting food.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy to say that 50% of adults</p>
<p>are eating within 15 hours or longer.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And quite frequently throughout that period.</p>
<p>Quite frequently too.</p>
<p>And then if we asked what fraction of our adults</p>
<p>were actually eating the conventional within 12 hours,</p>
<p>three meals a day or something like that, it was 10%.</p>
<p>So these-</p>
<p>So snacking has gone up dramatically,</p>
<p>however you want to define snacking,</p>
<p>the frequency of food intake throughout the day.</p>
<p>And outside this breakfast, lunch, and dinner,</p>
<p>there are all these small snacks here and there.</p>
<p>And also for a lot of people, the dinner is delayed.</p>
<p>And we went back and looked at, okay,</p>
<p>so what kind of food people are eating late at night</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And what came out interesting,</p>
<p>which is very counterintuitive,</p>
<p>is people who prepare their own dinner,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more likely to eat later at night</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re coming home</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re taking some time to prepare dinner.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re sitting down and eating,</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re eating next to the computer,</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>So it was kind of interesting that came out.</p>
<p>But coming back to your point,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I say that nearly 90% of adults</p>
<p>are eating for more than 12 hours.</p>
<p>So that means a lot of people can,</p>
<p>there is scope or there is enough headspace</p>
<p>to reduce and eat within.</p>
<p>So as I said, all of this are interrelated.</p>
<p>So when you think about children,</p>
<p>most sleep researchers agree that children and teenagers</p>
<p>should sleep somewhere between nine to 10 or 11 hours</p>
<p>because young children, even five to 10 year old,</p>
<p>they should sleep nine to 10 hours.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just pumping out growth hormone</p>
<p>and growing, growing, growing.</p>
<p>And then the teenagers, actually the recommendation is</p>
<p>they should be sleeping nine hours</p>
<p>because if you take teenagers,</p>
<p>take out all the stimulatory inputs to them</p>
<p>and then remove homework assignment and everything,</p>
<p>and then let them kind of equilibrate</p>
<p>to their homeostasis, what they&rsquo;re likely,</p>
<p>how many hours they&rsquo;re likely to sleep,</p>
<p>that turns out to be somewhere between eight and a half</p>
<p>to nine and a half hours,</p>
<p>which also means that going back to sleep,</p>
<p>nearly 90% of high school students in this country</p>
<p>are chronically sleep deprived</p>
<p>because most high school students don&rsquo;t get nine hours</p>
<p>of sleep on a regular basis, maybe in the weekend.</p>
<p>Probably because of devices.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on iPads and phones.</p>
<p>And also, as I said, this new idea</p>
<p>that midnight is your assignment submission time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to that again and again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing that again and again, so teachers take note.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting idea as a way</p>
<p>to kind of anchor behavior earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Yeah, learning to, I mean, public health is complicated</p>
<p>because people are incentivized by fear,</p>
<p>but you get more bees with honey, as they say, right?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s incentivizing people to wake earlier,</p>
<p>not necessarily with the sunrise,</p>
<p>but wake earlier and go to sleep earlier</p>
<p>and eat within an eight to 12 hour window.</p>
<p>12 if it&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s why I said, yeah.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like, you know,</p>
<p>all these health benefits are what I think</p>
<p>are going to incentivize people more than,</p>
<p>for instance, this idea that, well, if you don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get dementia or something of that sort.</p>
<p>No, no, exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>People will feel more healthy and more productive.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I said that even if children</p>
<p>are supposed to sleep for nine hours,</p>
<p>of course they&rsquo;re not eating during those nine hours,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not feeding children</p>
<p>and putting them down to sleep</p>
<p>because their core body temperature will be high,</p>
<p>they cannot fall asleep.</p>
<p>So at least they should have their last meal</p>
<p>one or two hours before going to bed</p>
<p>because typically parents feed them</p>
<p>and maybe give them a shower or a bath,</p>
<p>and then they read the bedtime story.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one to two hours before bedtime</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re finishing food.</p>
<p>Similarly, on the other end, after they wake up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that we are waking them up and then feeding them.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why 12 hours seems to be optimum.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only, I&rsquo;m saying that</p>
<p>if we put all the health recommendations together</p>
<p>from pediatricians, then it makes sense.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>I have a question about structuring meal intake</p>
<p>or food intake during the eating window.</p>
<p>I have a good friend, actually he&rsquo;s the neurosurgeon</p>
<p>at Neuralink now, but he came up through Stanford</p>
<p>and he has a habit of skipping one meal per day</p>
<p>within a feeding window.</p>
<p>So it might be breakfast, lunch, skip dinner one day,</p>
<p>then it might be breakfast, dinner the next day,</p>
<p>lunch and dinner the next one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not in keeping with the same start time always,</p>
<p>but the end time is either gonna be earlier</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a gate, it&rsquo;s never later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never later.</p>
<p>What do you think about that as a strategy?</p>
<p>You know, in many ways, it feels like that fits</p>
<p>with the way that a lot of people&rsquo;s lives run.</p>
<p>So sometimes, for instance, if I&rsquo;m in a podcast,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to eat much during the middle of the day</p>
<p>because it makes me a little bit groggy,</p>
<p>the post-parendial dip in energy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll do breakfast, well, again, at 11.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first, that&rsquo;s when I break my fast, 11-ish.</p>
<p>And then dinner, maybe a snack in the middle of the day,</p>
<p>but other days it&rsquo;s three meals.</p>
<p>So does it matter overall,</p>
<p>as long as one isn&rsquo;t allowing the start time</p>
<p>and the ending time to drift out?</p>
<p>Is it okay if you go from 12 hours to 10 to eight,</p>
<p>eight, 10, four, 12,</p>
<p>as long as you don&rsquo;t exceed the brackets, are you okay?</p>
<p>So this is where the circadian aspect come in,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re moving that breakfast time or dinner time</p>
<p>three, four hours, you&rsquo;re essentially causing</p>
<p>maybe a metabolic jet lag.</p>
<p>You know, in short term, in weeks, months,</p>
<p>or maybe even a few years, you may not see any change.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what are the long-term consequences.</p>
<p>One thing is we always think,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to this point again and again,</p>
<p>we think that our body weight is a marker of health,</p>
<p>or body composition is a marker of health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always true, because as I said,</p>
<p>acid reflux, feeling, you know,</p>
<p>having some pang of depression or anxiety.</p>
<p>Or LDL, like high LDL.</p>
<p>High LDL.</p>
<p>A lot of thin people have,</p>
<p>or low body fat people have very high LDL.</p>
<p>Yeah, so those are the things</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t connect with our habit.</p>
<p>And since circadian rhythm and meal timing,</p>
<p>meal structure now is a very new field.</p>
<p>I think good studies will come out only in a few years.</p>
<p>Because right now people are just going back</p>
<p>and retrospectively looking at some diet record,</p>
<p>one day of diet record,</p>
<p>and trying to glean too much out of it.</p>
<p>But I think hopefully things will improve</p>
<p>where people will become,</p>
<p>it will become standard to at least look</p>
<p>for one week of diet record.</p>
<p>Mealtime and what they&rsquo;re eating, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Because there are now mouse studies also showing</p>
<p>whether front-loading carbohydrate,</p>
<p>or front-loading fat, or protein has benefit over.</p>
<p>So I think these studies are starting.</p>
<p>So I should not comment whether that&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great to hold off</p>
<p>until then we have you back on to discuss.</p>
<p>I have a question about fasting on the longer term.</p>
<p>And there, it&rsquo;s a near infinite space we could explore</p>
<p>of two days of fasting.</p>
<p>I know people that every once in a while,</p>
<p>they just decide I&rsquo;m fasting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve either been eating too much at parties,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not feeling well, or whatever.</p>
<p>They just decide I&rsquo;m fasting for 24 hours.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll still consume water and caffeine,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll just fast.</p>
<p>Is there any health benefit or detriment?</p>
<p>You mentioned the circadian clock shifting effects.</p>
<p>But if somebody wakes up on Sunday</p>
<p>and they ate too much, or they feel they ate too much,</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t like the food they ate on Saturday,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really feeling it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just gonna fast into Monday.</p>
<p>Is there any known benefit or health detriment</p>
<p>to doing that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s actually a rich literature</p>
<p>on this complete fast.</p>
<p>And in fact, in many religion,</p>
<p>people practice complete fast as a way to cleanse their body</p>
<p>and people have seen that there are benefits to that.</p>
<p>So in fact, the every other day eating in mouse model,</p>
<p>or even in humans that are also initially</p>
<p>some studies were done, there are many health benefits.</p>
<p>And right now there are even fasting clinics in Germany</p>
<p>where people check in and they&rsquo;re under strict supervision</p>
<p>and then they do complete fast</p>
<p>or maybe a small bowl of soup, which has 100, 200 kilocal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all they get to eat.</p>
<p>Sometimes two, three days, four days, five days,</p>
<p>even they have gone up to three or four weeks.</p>
<p>For sake of weight loss, is that why?</p>
<p>For many different things.</p>
<p>And they come out pretty well healthy.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re under supervision,</p>
<p>make sure that they&rsquo;re getting the micronutrients,</p>
<p>vitamins and electrolytes.</p>
<p>So those studies are pretty solid.</p>
<p>People have observed that.</p>
<p>And then in fact, there are even idea that fasting,</p>
<p>this kind of fasting can have huge impact on brain</p>
<p>and people may come out of treatment resistant depression</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>So those studies are very difficult to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only case of one here and there</p>
<p>that we hear once in a while.</p>
<p>But hopefully in future, we&rsquo;ll see whether the depression,</p>
<p>anxiety, the mental health aspect will benefit from fasting</p>
<p>because now as there is more and more evidence</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this gut brain axis</p>
<p>and what are the presence of food</p>
<p>or the microbiome changes in the gut.</p>
<p>If they can affect brain, then maybe long-term fasting,</p>
<p>periodic fasting, a few days of low calorie diet</p>
<p>back to back will be interesting to see</p>
<p>how it impacts brain health.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on fat fasting?</p>
<p>Where people try and limit their blood glucose</p>
<p>by only eating mainly fats, mainly healthy.</p>
<p>Typically they&rsquo;ll eat healthier fats.</p>
<p>So avocados, olive oils, and nuts and some animal fats</p>
<p>perhaps, but as a way to keep blood glucose low</p>
<p>and also time restrict.</p>
<p>This goes back to the kind of low carbohydrate thing.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that</p>
<p>as a general strategy for health?</p>
<p>I mean, it combines sort of two general themes</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>I think both of which are data are still incoming</p>
<p>that restricting the feeding times, it can be beneficial</p>
<p>as well as keeping overall blood glucose lower</p>
<p>can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there is too much emphasis now</p>
<p>on blood sugar spiking or we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this kind of eating pattern, for example,</p>
<p>means we are essentially telling pancreas that, okay,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the islet cells that produce insulin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, you can take a break, go on vacation</p>
<p>for a month or two or three months.</p>
<p>My question is, it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see</p>
<p>what happens to those islets, because for example,</p>
<p>we know that if we disuse or unuse our muscles,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s muscle atrophy, muscles will become weaker.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether long-term consequences</p>
<p>of this very low carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not essentially engaging the islet cells</p>
<p>periodically, what is its impact?</p>
<p>So if there is no impact, maybe it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>because as you know, many people who actually work</p>
<p>on ketogenic diet, the researchers themselves,</p>
<p>they find it very difficult to stay in true ketogenic diet</p>
<p>because the true ketogenic diet is consuming</p>
<p>less than 10% of calories from carbohydrate.</p>
<p>And not very many from protein.</p>
<p>A lot of people think ketogenic diet allows them</p>
<p>to eat massive amounts of meat,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>Just one clarification for people,</p>
<p>Sachin was referring to islet cells of the pancreas,</p>
<p>which are the ones that manufacture insulin.</p>
<p>So the question is whether or not taking in low levels</p>
<p>of blood glucose by way of a low carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>those islet cells are going to shut off their production.</p>
<p>Very interesting, I mean, the liver&rsquo;s a very plastic tissue.</p>
<p>I mean, it tends to react very dramatically</p>
<p>to lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;ll be interesting</p>
<p>to see what happens, means we know that even muscle disuse,</p>
<p>for example, people who become bedridden,</p>
<p>they lose some muscle mass, but when they come back</p>
<p>and exercise, they gain it back.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens</p>
<p>in these people who are going through</p>
<p>a long-term ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>And of course, once in a while,</p>
<p>because of social pressure or something else,</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have access to food or something happens,</p>
<p>they may consume some sugar,</p>
<p>some blood glucose will spike,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that every spike is bad.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason why we have insulin is for good reason.</p>
<p>To buffer that spike.</p>
<p>To buffer that spike, and also, you know,</p>
<p>people always say that, well, if you have insulin produced</p>
<p>or insulin-like growth factor, those are really bad,</p>
<p>and you should avoid that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a little bit extreme, and-</p>
<p>I mean, the insulin growth factor</p>
<p>has evolved in muscle protein synthesis,</p>
<p>tissue repair, maybe even cognition.</p>
<p>And it also goes back to, say, mTOR activation</p>
<p>and all that stuff, people get really excited</p>
<p>about how to reduce mTOR activation,</p>
<p>rapamycin and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So this is where, again, from circadian point of view,</p>
<p>I ask people to think.</p>
<p>So two very popular drug-like molecules or drugs</p>
<p>that people think will increase longevity are metformin,</p>
<p>which many people agree, not all will come to a consensus</p>
<p>that it activates AMP kinase, or the sensor in the cells</p>
<p>that sense that your cells are fasting.</p>
<p>So metformin kind of activates it so that it kind of,</p>
<p>you can say, although it may not be scientifically accurate,</p>
<p>the, you know, fasting in a pill.</p>
<p>So it sort of mimics fasting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the thing I&rsquo;d lump in there with metformin</p>
<p>is that berberine is kind of the poor man&rsquo;s metformin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tree bark extract</p>
<p>that also dramatically lowers blood glucose.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it mimics kind of that fasting.</p>
<p>And then rapamycin also kind of reduces mTOR activation.</p>
<p>And people have shown that rapamycin and metformin</p>
<p>can extend mouse lifespan and improve health.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s go back to the calorie restriction study</p>
<p>that I mentioned.</p>
<p>In calorie restriction, people are giving food as a lunchtime</p>
<p>and they were essentially doing time restriction.</p>
<p>The mice were doing time restriction.</p>
<p>If we think about it, during daytime,</p>
<p>when experimenters are coming to the vivarium,</p>
<p>the mice should be sleeping and fasting.</p>
<p>And they should naturally have high level of AMP kinase</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re truly fasting.</p>
<p>And they should also have low level of mTOR activity</p>
<p>because mTOR responds to insulin</p>
<p>and that should go off at night.</p>
<p>So my suspicion is in many of these experiments</p>
<p>where the mice were allowed to eat ad libitum,</p>
<p>even normal standard chow,</p>
<p>now we know that as mice get older,</p>
<p>they actually consume a little bit more food during daytime.</p>
<p>Which is the equivalent of human nighttime.</p>
<p>Human&rsquo;s nighttime eating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nighttime eating we know is an issue.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that was more of an issue as people age.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we don&rsquo;t know, but at least in mice,</p>
<p>because we can put the mice in calorimetry,</p>
<p>look at every single bite they&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>how much they&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>So I guess it was natural to see that researchers found</p>
<p>that there is some mTOR activity during daytime</p>
<p>when the mice were not supposed to have mTOR activity</p>
<p>because they should be fasting.</p>
<p>And since they ate a little bit,</p>
<p>they were snacking during daytime,</p>
<p>AMP kinase activity was not at its peak.</p>
<p>So giving metformin kind of mimic their fasting state</p>
<p>and reducing mTOR activity by drug like rapamycin</p>
<p>also kind of mimics some aspect of the fasting state.</p>
<p>So my suspicion is since these studies were done</p>
<p>always in mice who are supposed to be in the fasting state</p>
<p>and both mTOR, sorry, rapamycin and AMP kinase activity</p>
<p>or metformin kind of are mimicking that fasting state,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we have seen those benefits.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if that experiment</p>
<p>will be done in humans in the long term</p>
<p>because many people are very excited about,</p>
<p>you know, there is mTOR long-term metformin study</p>
<p>and then a lot of people are actually consuming</p>
<p>good amount of rapamycin off level, they can get their own.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my curiosity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying whether it&rsquo;s good or bad</p>
<p>or whether there is science or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that will be interesting</p>
<p>to control for and see.</p>
<p>Because recently I saw one of my, again,</p>
<p>close friend and colleague at Scripps, Katya Lamia,</p>
<p>she did a very simple, elegant study</p>
<p>people should have done in metformin field.</p>
<p>And she took mice and then measured their blood glucose</p>
<p>at different time of the day.</p>
<p>And in fact, just like human blood glucose,</p>
<p>our blood glucose fluctuates a little bit.</p>
<p>She saw that rhythm.</p>
<p>And then in every two hours or three hours</p>
<p>on different days, of course,</p>
<p>she gave the same dose of metformin to mice.</p>
<p>And what she found was at different time of the day,</p>
<p>metformin had very dramatic change</p>
<p>in glucose reducing ability.</p>
<p>So which means that even if you take metformin</p>
<p>and give at different time of the day for the mouse</p>
<p>or even for humans, in very long term,</p>
<p>of course, in these mice,</p>
<p>and these mice were not diabetic or anything,</p>
<p>they were healthy mice to begin with.</p>
<p>So in long term, we might see benefits</p>
<p>that are very different.</p>
<p>So this brings to this idea that,</p>
<p>well, maybe metformin, say, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>evening metformin may trigger that fasting state</p>
<p>much earlier than end of digestion.</p>
<p>Whereas metformin in the beginning of the day may not,</p>
<p>at least from longevity perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about type two diabetes here.</p>
<p>So the same thing with mTOR.</p>
<p>Is mTOR going to have much better impact</p>
<p>if taken during evening, morning, before meal?</p>
<p>So these are my thoughts that go along</p>
<p>with all this fat story that we talked about.</p>
<p>Do you take metformin or Berberine?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t taken.</p>
<p>Although, you know, I have close friend and colleague,</p>
<p>Ruben Shaw, who is now the director</p>
<p>of Cancer Center at Salk.</p>
<p>He extensively works on AMP kinase and its mechanisms</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s always fun to talk to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a fan.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve taken Berberine before</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had two different,</p>
<p>very distinct experiences with them.</p>
<p>First of all, Berberine, when ingested with carbohydrates,</p>
<p>in particular carbohydrates that have a lot</p>
<p>of simple sugars, definitely,</p>
<p>I know this because I measured my blood glucose,</p>
<p>I did the experiment,</p>
<p>allows you to flatten out your blood glucose response.</p>
<p>So, you know, in some sense, if you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>there is this idea, if you&rsquo;re going to eat</p>
<p>a particularly big meal or sugary meal</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to get a massive blood glucose rise,</p>
<p>you take Berberine or metformin.</p>
<p>Metformin is prescription, that&rsquo;s why I went with Berberine</p>
<p>because as far as I know, it works as well.</p>
<p>At least for healthy people.</p>
<p>Yeah, for healthy people, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When I took Berberine and did not ingest large amounts</p>
<p>of simple sugars or carbohydrates along with it,</p>
<p>I experienced profound hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>I felt like complete garbage for about eight hours.</p>
<p>And I had one of the worst headaches of my life.</p>
<p>Because, which makes sense,</p>
<p>you just got a blood sugar crash.</p>
<p>So if you lower your blood sugar</p>
<p>when you already have fairly low blood sugar</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not ingesting carbohydrates,</p>
<p>you can really bottom out your blood glucose.</p>
<p>So just say it&rsquo;s, I say that as a, for two reasons.</p>
<p>One is kind of a cautionary note.</p>
<p>And the other one that when you think about the biology</p>
<p>of these compounds, it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And I think that, and I did not pay attention</p>
<p>to the circadian effects.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, when I joined Salk around that,</p>
<p>we know Ron Evans is the kind of the big leader</p>
<p>in metabolism and he works on nuclear hormone receptors.</p>
<p>These are the master regulator of metabolism</p>
<p>in normal cells, cancer cells, and many other.</p>
<p>And what was interesting was in the first few years,</p>
<p>Ron did a very simple experiment.</p>
<p>He just looked at what time of the day</p>
<p>this nuclear hormone receptors are turned on</p>
<p>at gene expression level and some at protein level.</p>
<p>And he found that almost all of them</p>
<p>have a circadian pattern, at least in some tissue.</p>
<p>So he went to that length to say even</p>
<p>that circadian is metabolism and metabolism is circadian.</p>
<p>The reason why we have a circadian rhythm</p>
<p>is to have a daily rhythms in food seeking behavior</p>
<p>and eating, and also go through a period of time</p>
<p>when we should be fasting.</p>
<p>And then on the other hand, all the metabolic regulators</p>
<p>also have to follow that rule.</p>
<p>And almost all metabolic regulators,</p>
<p>everything that we can think of connected</p>
<p>to metabolizing macronutrient, protein, carb, and fat,</p>
<p>they should also have a circadian rhythm</p>
<p>or diurnal cycle to align or misalign.</p>
<p>So for example, fat oxidation should be</p>
<p>in opposite phase with feeding.</p>
<p>And in retrospect, at that time,</p>
<p>it was kind of amazing to see Ron could foresee,</p>
<p>of course, he&rsquo;s smart enough to foresee</p>
<p>and predict that this is going to happen to circadian period.</p>
<p>Because at that time, we&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about the suprachiasmatic nucleus, sleep-wake cycle,</p>
<p>and we are not thinking too much about metabolism.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the awesome thing about Salk, being at Salk,</p>
<p>because we have 50 PIs really crammed</p>
<p>into two awesome buildings and with open lab structure.</p>
<p>So you bump onto each other and talk to each other.</p>
<p>And with an ocean view.</p>
<p>With an ocean view.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s an amazing place.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have an adjunct position there</p>
<p>when my lab was at UCSD, and it is an amazing place</p>
<p>doing incredible groundbreaking work,</p>
<p>which of course includes yours.</p>
<p>Sachin, I&rsquo;m clear now that we have to have you back on</p>
<p>for another series of discussions, seriously speaking,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d be so kind and willing to do that.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for several things.</p>
<p>First of all, for taking the time today</p>
<p>to sit down and discuss these incredibly interesting ideas</p>
<p>in detail.</p>
<p>Much of what we talk about on the podcast</p>
<p>is obviously grounded in science and often,</p>
<p>but not always is actionable.</p>
<p>And so much of what we talked about today is actionable</p>
<p>in the sense that many people are already doing</p>
<p>certain dimensions of these things.</p>
<p>Some are not, some are hearing about it and considering it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given us dozens, I&rsquo;ve listed some out,</p>
<p>dozens of tools and considerations</p>
<p>based on whether or not people are engaging</p>
<p>in shift work or not.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are going to realize</p>
<p>that they are shift workers,</p>
<p>even though they didn&rsquo;t think they were</p>
<p>because of the nature of their habits now</p>
<p>to light and to activity and so forth.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the firefighter study</p>
<p>because of its relevance to the general population.</p>
<p>Also another nod to firefighters</p>
<p>and shift workers everywhere, thank you.</p>
<p>And I think among the colleagues I&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>for several decades now,</p>
<p>you really are one of a very small few</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve managed to do both animal studies and human studies,</p>
<p>but also animal studies with a very clear eye</p>
<p>and a pointer toward human health.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s such a vital and rare thing,</p>
<p>especially in this day of extremely competitive funding.</p>
<p>So I want to thank you for your time today,</p>
<p>for the knowledge you share,</p>
<p>the actionable aspects of that knowledge,</p>
<p>the science that you&rsquo;re doing in your laboratory.</p>
<p>We will provide links for people to learn more about you</p>
<p>and of course to go to the app</p>
<p>so people can engage in some of the science directly.</p>
<p>And of course you have several wonderful books now</p>
<p>that we will also link to,</p>
<p>both of which I&rsquo;ve read and are wonderful,</p>
<p>in particular the first book,</p>
<p>but also a book related to diabetes.</p>
<p>And so for diabetics and people interested in metabolic</p>
<p>and blood sugar regulation there.</p>
<p>So on behalf of myself and my team here</p>
<p>at the Huberman Lab Podcast and all the listeners,</p>
<p>I just want to say thank you so much.</p>
<p>Your time is valuable.</p>
<p>And the fact that you share it with us</p>
<p>and educate so many people is really a gift.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>And actually likewise, there are very few scientists</p>
<p>who have taken this leadership role that you have taken</p>
<p>to come and communicate science to the public.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy because sometimes you have to distill it down</p>
<p>to a simple soundbite to the point where the scientist</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say, oh, that may not be right.</p>
<p>But we always have to keep in mind</p>
<p>that we are always living in the dark age of science</p>
<p>because the reason why I say that,</p>
<p>this is not my quote actually,</p>
<p>this is from one of my scientific hero,</p>
<p>Paul Simmel from Scripps.</p>
<p>He always says, think about it.</p>
<p>10 years ago, what you thought was right</p>
<p>and the best has already changed.</p>
<p>But one thing is the circadian rhythm</p>
<p>and aligning it to our internal clock</p>
<p>to our habit is very important.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned, we have our My Circadian Clock app,</p>
<p>which is research facing,</p>
<p>but we have also distilled all of this</p>
<p>down to five or six timing component.</p>
<p>And we have a new app called On Time Health</p>
<p>or Get On Time Health.</p>
<p>Can people access that through the standard app stores?</p>
<p>Yeah, so now it&rsquo;s available in Apple App Store.</p>
<p>And we want to see how,</p>
<p>because people always think about fasting,</p>
<p>but as we discussed today, feeding fasting</p>
<p>or eating fasting and activity and sleep,</p>
<p>are kind of interlinked</p>
<p>and we have to kind of balance both of these.</p>
<p>So that was the idea behind this On Time Health program.</p>
<p>And thank you, Andy,</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re doing is immensely necessary,</p>
<p>particularly these days when science</p>
<p>is moving at a very fast pace,</p>
<p>there are a lot of results coming out.</p>
<p>Sometimes something can be very confusing</p>
<p>and you spending your time to communicate science</p>
<p>is exceptional.</p>
<p>So thank you, Andy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re most welcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s days like today where I get to sit down</p>
<p>and talk to brilliant colleagues like you</p>
<p>who are doing the important work</p>
<p>that really matters so much.</p>
<p>And so, as you mentioned a moment ago,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of darkness and confusion out there,</p>
<p>but thank you for being one of those who&rsquo;s shining light.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>with Dr. Sachin Panda,</p>
<p>all about circadian biology and time-restricted feeding.</p>

<p>I do read all the comments.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>On various episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving sleep, supporting hormones,</p>
<p>improving focus, and so on.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to have partnered</p>
<p>with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>are the very highest quality</p>
<p>and are used with various sports teams</p>
<p>and various studies through the Department of Defense</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And Momentous Supplements tend to be</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>Single ingredient formulations are absolutely essential</p>
<p>if you are going to develop the most cost-effective</p>
<p>and biologically effective supplement regimen for you</p>
<p>because, simply put, they allow you to adjust the dosage</p>
<p>of individual ingredients, to alternate days</p>
<p>that you take different ingredients,</p>
<p>to cycle them, and so forth.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>are available internationally,</p>
<p>which many other supplements are not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements discussed</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following me on social media,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,</p>
<p>Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And at all of those places,</p>
<p>I cover science and science-based tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the contents</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed</p>
<p>to the Huberman Lab podcast neural network newsletter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a monthly newsletter that includes free toolkits,</p>
<p>things like Toolkit for Sleep,</p>
<p>how to enhance the quality and duration of your sleep,</p>
<p>Toolkit for Focus, Toolkit for Neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>Toolkit for Deliberate Cold Exposure, Heat Exposure,</p>
<p>and summaries of podcast episodes.</p>
<p>All of those toolkits can be found</p>
<p>by going to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter,</p>
<p>and simply give us your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>And again, the newsletters and toolkits</p>
<p>are completely zero cost,</p>
<p>and you will also find some PDF examples</p>
<p>of previous toolkits.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for joining me</p>
<p>for today&rsquo;s discussion with Dr. Satchin Panda.</p>
<p>I hope you found the conversation to be as informative</p>
<p>and actionable as I did.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
