    <p>don&rsquo;t ever get in</p>
<p>front of a high definition camera in bright</p>
<p>lights because you will see what you really look like</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just kidding i&rsquo;m beautiful</p>
<p>hi guys how are you today my name is bailey</p>
<p>sarian and today is monday which means it&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re new here on</p>
<p>mondays i&rsquo;ve been doing a little like series</p>
<p>thing where i sit down i talk</p>
<p>about a true crime or like a murder</p>
<p>story i know it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>and then i get ready true</p>
<p>crime and makeup we married them and we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>if you like true crime stories</p>
<p>you like makeup go ahead and subscribe a little warning</p>
<p>about today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>spoiler alert</p>
<p>another cannibal</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit more intense this</p>
<p>story today is about armin</p>
<p>mavis tell you i</p>
<p>watched over and over and over</p>
<p>again a youtube video with</p>
<p>an interview with armin</p>
<p>get into my head like how he says his last name</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna call him armin</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s his name no</p>
<p>need to use his last name and he&rsquo;s german and this is</p>
<p>based in germany</p>
<p>i can barely</p>
<p>speak english correctly</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m trying my best here</p>
<p>but something that really interests me</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>like glorify or idolize</p>
<p>these people whatsoever but it</p>
<p>definitely interests me and that is cannibalism</p>
<p>not in a way</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s something i like want to partake</p>
<p>in i wanna like</p>
<p>be in it no it&rsquo;s nothing like that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i find it like very interesting i</p>
<p>think because it&rsquo;s so far opposite of anything</p>
<p>i have ever</p>
<p>heard of or my brain</p>
<p>truly can&rsquo;t comprehend</p>
<p>and i consider myself a very curious cat meow</p>
<p>so i get very like invested in</p>
<p>these types of</p>
<p>things i just</p>
<p>wanna know like</p>
<p>everything i can</p>
<p>about these people and like find a pattern</p>
<p>in their stories or have an</p>
<p>understanding of</p>
<p>is it something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re born with or is it something that you learn</p>
<p>like the nurture</p>
<p>versus nature type of deal</p>
<p>okay so armin he was born on december 1st 1961</p>
<p>armin&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>he was police officer</p>
<p>so he had a good job</p>
<p>he saved up enough</p>
<p>money to buy his family a 36 room</p>
<p>16 000 square foot mansion</p>
<p>in germany so armin&rsquo;s parents they</p>
<p>married when the mom</p>
<p>was 40 years old</p>
<p>and dad was 21 years old so there was a big</p>
<p>age difference armin</p>
<p>would say that like</p>
<p>his mom was extremely controlling she was manipulative</p>
<p>jesus christ she was manipulative</p>
<p>she was jealous she was always accusing</p>
<p>her husband of</p>
<p>cheating and that</p>
<p>she got pregnant with armen</p>
<p>pretty much as a way to keep</p>
<p>her husband</p>
<p>not because she wanted a baby</p>
<p>but because she just wanted to</p>
<p>pretty much keep her husband so he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>his mom was extremely just</p>
<p>possessive of him</p>
<p>i guess his mom and dad</p>
<p>would always</p>
<p>fight and then she</p>
<p>would threaten</p>
<p>to kill him all the time like this was just a normal</p>
<p>thing that would happen in the</p>
<p>household and it was just a very</p>
<p>toxic relationship</p>
<p>so there were a</p>
<p>total of three kids</p>
<p>so arman was the youngest and then he had two</p>
<p>older siblings</p>
<p>but when he was</p>
<p>young like five or six years old his</p>
<p>older siblings actually left the</p>
<p>house they just were</p>
<p>tired of it</p>
<p>since they were</p>
<p>older they were like</p>
<p>older teenagers</p>
<p>they just decided</p>
<p>peace out were gone</p>
<p>so they left</p>
<p>which just left armin</p>
<p>at home with his mom and dad by himself armin</p>
<p>would say that his mom</p>
<p>would just not show any affection</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t loving she didn&rsquo;t show any type of love</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>um relationship really at all between them</p>
<p>if anything she</p>
<p>would just yell</p>
<p>at him she was always asking him to do all of the</p>
<p>household chores</p>
<p>like she wouldn&rsquo;t really do</p>
<p>anything it was always up to him and he&rsquo;s like six or</p>
<p>seven years old and then eventually</p>
<p>armand&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>just picked up and left</p>
<p>and armin was</p>
<p>seven years old</p>
<p>so when he was pretty</p>
<p>young his dad just</p>
<p>stormed out of the house</p>
<p>got into the car</p>
<p>and drove off</p>
<p>no explanation</p>
<p>nothing and he</p>
<p>never saw him</p>
<p>again so not only did his</p>
<p>older siblings</p>
<p>leave i mean so did his father so</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t imagine what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do to a child but</p>
<p>life goes on</p>
<p>and to keep himself busy like to pass the time he</p>
<p>would read so he</p>
<p>started reading</p>
<p>robinson crusoe</p>
<p>i guess just to keep it simple the story</p>
<p>in it there is a part</p>
<p>about cannibalism</p>
<p>he found himself just being fixated</p>
<p>on eating another person and</p>
<p>would kind of obsess over it</p>
<p>he was ten years old at the time</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>it started for him the introduction</p>
<p>so time goes on and then</p>
<p>at 19 years old armen left home and he joined the west</p>
<p>german army he wanted to be a professional soldier and</p>
<p>spent 12 years in the armed</p>
<p>forces he felt</p>
<p>comfortable and normality that stopped him from</p>
<p>pursuing his fantasies</p>
<p>during this period when he was in the army</p>
<p>he developed friendships with</p>
<p>women but it</p>
<p>never went anywhere</p>
<p>he started to question his sexuality and</p>
<p>would ask his friend like do you</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m gay</p>
<p>and his friend</p>
<p>would say that&rsquo;s something that that you need to know</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t tell you that his friend</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s an interview with his friend</p>
<p>he would say that like everyone kind of knew he was gay</p>
<p>but it was kind of like armin was the last to know</p>
<p>or maybe he just didn&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>started drinking and he</p>
<p>started drinking pretty heavily</p>
<p>he ended up getting in two car accidents</p>
<p>and both of</p>
<p>them were because he was driving intoxicated</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>ended up getting kicked out</p>
<p>from the army</p>
<p>so then he moves back home with his mom</p>
<p>and at this</p>
<p>point he&rsquo;s now 32</p>
<p>so he was in the army for a</p>
<p>while so armin moves back home with his mom at this</p>
<p>point she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>older now she&rsquo;s ill</p>
<p>she really can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>much for herself any longer not that she it&rsquo;s from the</p>
<p>sounds of it it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sound like she really did anything on her own anyways</p>
<p>but he went there to take care of her</p>
<p>plus there was plenty of room because</p>
<p>she lived in this humongo mansion</p>
<p>he decided to go in a different career path though</p>
<p>and he ended up</p>
<p>becoming a computer engineer</p>
<p>and he succeeded</p>
<p>in his job doing that he worked for i believe a bank</p>
<p>so then the 90s come around</p>
<p>and armin got</p>
<p>introduced where the</p>
<p>whole world got</p>
<p>introduced to the</p>
<p>world wide web the good old days</p>
<p>now back in like when the internet</p>
<p>first started</p>
<p>first of all websites were</p>
<p>super janky but also</p>
<p>the internet really wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that monitored</p>
<p>as well so like there wasn&rsquo;t anyone policing</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>could be illegal you see what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>armin started to poke</p>
<p>around on the internet kind of like typing in whatever</p>
<p>and he came across a community of</p>
<p>cannibals it was like a website that was for cannibals</p>
<p>and they would all</p>
<p>discuss it was pretty much like a forum</p>
<p>where everyone</p>
<p>would come together not everyone the cannibals</p>
<p>would come together and talk about</p>
<p>how they pretty much want to eat each</p>
<p>other and their</p>
<p>fantasies of eating people</p>
<p>so when armin</p>
<p>saw this he was like</p>
<p>hell yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other people out there like me so like so i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>alone in feeling like this like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other people out there feeling like this</p>
<p>and the internet</p>
<p>really it bridged a gap between fantasy and reality</p>
<p>he ended up</p>
<p>building his own website</p>
<p>where he can openly talk</p>
<p>about cannibalism</p>
<p>and he would also create fake</p>
<p>images there was this website that he</p>
<p>would visit it was called cannibal cafe</p>
<p>and naturally when i read that i was like</p>
<p>cannibal cafe</p>
<p>and i try to let go to the website whatever</p>
<p>i was just curious to know if it was</p>
<p>still up it&rsquo;s not up anymore</p>
<p>but if you use wayback machine</p>
<p>it lets you</p>
<p>browse past</p>
<p>internet stuff</p>
<p>that you really</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find nowadays and you can find it through</p>
<p>there you can&rsquo;t find armand&rsquo;s posts from back then</p>
<p>a lot of them got removed and</p>
<p>once shit went</p>
<p>down but it&rsquo;s such an interesting website</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty much just a</p>
<p>cheap looking well yeah</p>
<p>cause the internet back then was so basic</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like a forum</p>
<p>like a and people just post</p>
<p>about like their</p>
<p>fantasies i</p>
<p>wanna eat your</p>
<p>flesh and just</p>
<p>well i can&rsquo;t wait to murder this girl and eat her</p>
<p>yeah a lot of that so armin</p>
<p>being a little</p>
<p>crafty little</p>
<p>bitch that he is</p>
<p>he would go down to like a butcher shop he</p>
<p>would buy some meat he</p>
<p>would take this meat and like</p>
<p>shape it and</p>
<p>sculpt it into</p>
<p>make it look like they were body parts</p>
<p>he would take</p>
<p>photos of it and then he</p>
<p>would post it on</p>
<p>these websites that he was</p>
<p>visiting and make it look like</p>
<p>he really did kill somebody</p>
<p>and like brag</p>
<p>about how he killed somebody</p>
<p>and cook them and</p>
<p>ate them and stuff</p>
<p>so people have been</p>
<p>lying on the internet</p>
<p>since day one so</p>
<p>just fyi he made it look like it was real dead bodies</p>
<p>and he was sharing</p>
<p>these images on the cannibal websites</p>
<p>and people were</p>
<p>believing it and like idolizing him because he</p>
<p>was actually doing it like all</p>
<p>these people on there were talk</p>
<p>and he was actually</p>
<p>doing it so he kind of became a little internet</p>
<p>famous then the</p>
<p>second of september</p>
<p>1999 rolls around armin comes home from work so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still working his computer engineering job</p>
<p>comes home from work</p>
<p>he goes up to his mom&rsquo;s bedroom and he finds his mom</p>
<p>dead dead in bed now most of us</p>
<p>would be really sad</p>
<p>but armin was like</p>
<p>fuck yeah she dead</p>
<p>finally he was</p>
<p>excited because he was free</p>
<p>he was finally free from his mom&rsquo;s control from her</p>
<p>abuse and he felt like he</p>
<p>could finally deep dive into his</p>
<p>fantasy of eating people</p>
<p>because his mom wasn&rsquo;t there any longer to judge him</p>
<p>his mom didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like what he was doing</p>
<p>but with her not there he decided i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna turn one of the bedrooms</p>
<p>into like my</p>
<p>dungeon or my cannibal</p>
<p>room and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>take photos</p>
<p>all that good</p>
<p>stuff he was just relieved because now he</p>
<p>could live his life in his</p>
<p>own rules he felt a</p>
<p>sense of freedom</p>
<p>he now housed</p>
<p>the house to himself</p>
<p>and his dominating</p>
<p>mother was out of the picture</p>
<p>he then took his fantasy to the next</p>
<p>level two months</p>
<p>after his mom was gone he</p>
<p>started advertising on</p>
<p>these cannibal websites</p>
<p>so armin decided to post on the cannibal cafe website</p>
<p>asking for a volunteer</p>
<p>he was asking for anyone willing to be eaten</p>
<p>so a lot of the people on this website</p>
<p>would post like role play</p>
<p>they would say</p>
<p>role play when they wanted someone to just kind of play</p>
<p>along with the idea of being eaten but</p>
<p>armand was actually</p>
<p>looking for a volunteer someone who wanted to die and</p>
<p>if he could do it at</p>
<p>least he asked</p>
<p>before he did it</p>
<p>you know that was nice i</p>
<p>guess so he</p>
<p>kinda hit a</p>
<p>couple of websites because there were multiple cannibal</p>
<p>websites and he</p>
<p>would post in german and in english</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>said i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>search for a</p>
<p>young boy between eighteen and</p>
<p>thirty years old</p>
<p>if you have a normal</p>
<p>build body and you are willing to die</p>
<p>then come to me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>butchering you and eat your</p>
<p>horny flesh</p>
<p>hot i&rsquo;m not sure what horny</p>
<p>flesh is but okay</p>
<p>so armin made his way</p>
<p>around these websites</p>
<p>and he was looking for somebody who was willing to die</p>
<p>something that armand</p>
<p>stood by was that he didn&rsquo;t want somebody</p>
<p>who was not willing to die</p>
<p>he wanted this person to willingly</p>
<p>participate</p>
<p>and he made that very</p>
<p>clear so armand wants</p>
<p>horny flesh</p>
<p>surprisingly</p>
<p>he gets a lot of responses</p>
<p>a lot of people are writing him back but then last</p>
<p>minute they</p>
<p>would back out</p>
<p>but armin had one</p>
<p>guy come forward</p>
<p>and say like</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ll do it</p>
<p>so this man</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t get his name but</p>
<p>this man comes forward they start</p>
<p>emailing back and forth and this man</p>
<p>seems really interested he&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s my fantasy to be</p>
<p>eaten so armin</p>
<p>writes back cool</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say cool but he says</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s meet here at my</p>
<p>house we&rsquo;ll go through with it</p>
<p>so this man comes over to armand&rsquo;s mansion</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in this huge ass creepy mansion by himself</p>
<p>the man comes over and he lays out on the table</p>
<p>and armin is telling him play by play what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>and then the man tells armin that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not feeling well</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>wanna do this he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna go through with this and armin</p>
<p>he says okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not do this then</p>
<p>and he lets the man get up and walk out and go home</p>
<p>again armin</p>
<p>wanted somebody</p>
<p>who was willing</p>
<p>to be eaten he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna murder somebody like that wasn&rsquo;t his fantasy</p>
<p>which side note that guy is</p>
<p>lucky that armin</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>crazy because he</p>
<p>coulda easily</p>
<p>just died that night</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t armin</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to be a murderer</p>
<p>so armin was a little bummed that it didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>but little diy armin over here he ended up</p>
<p>paper macheing a body</p>
<p>he painted it and made it look like it was a person and</p>
<p>he took photos of it</p>
<p>he also got a mannequin from a</p>
<p>store one that was being thrown out</p>
<p>he got this mannequin painted it</p>
<p>again making it look like a dead body he</p>
<p>would take pictures of it</p>
<p>and post it on</p>
<p>the cannibal website making it look like</p>
<p>he did kill somebody</p>
<p>and ate them i mean the internet was just going</p>
<p>crazy over him they&rsquo;re like wow you&rsquo;re our hero</p>
<p>they were just really</p>
<p>idolizing armin</p>
<p>and the fact that he was</p>
<p>killing and eating people</p>
<p>so armin was</p>
<p>you know internet king on this cannibal</p>
<p>website and</p>
<p>was determined to find somebody who was willing to die</p>
<p>right and he</p>
<p>prepared one of the</p>
<p>extra rooms in the</p>
<p>house to be the</p>
<p>slaughter room</p>
<p>and the slaughter room had</p>
<p>no windows in there he had a cage to hold his</p>
<p>victims or whatever</p>
<p>and he also had meat hooks</p>
<p>um hanging from the ceiling kind of like catherine</p>
<p>so finally he gets a response</p>
<p>okay someone who is willing</p>
<p>to be eaten</p>
<p>the final person to respond to armand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>post his name was</p>
<p>brandas brandas</p>
<p>was an engineer</p>
<p>he was 34 years old he was actually married</p>
<p>but he came out to his wife as being curious</p>
<p>he wanted to</p>
<p>experiment with men</p>
<p>i think he knew he was gay but</p>
<p>maybe he was just</p>
<p>too afraid to actually say it because he was married</p>
<p>so they ended up</p>
<p>separating because it</p>
<p>caused a lot of tension in the relationship</p>
<p>so brandis was on</p>
<p>the cannibal websites as well he&rsquo;s interested in this</p>
<p>writes armin and he&rsquo;s like he volunteers himself to be</p>
<p>eaten they email each</p>
<p>other back and forth</p>
<p>and armin discusses with brandes</p>
<p>the best way</p>
<p>to be consumed and what he plans on doing with his body</p>
<p>brand is actually</p>
<p>throws out a lot of ideas as well like i want</p>
<p>my skull to be used as an ashtray</p>
<p>that was his request</p>
<p>brand is also expressed to arm</p>
<p>in that he wanted his</p>
<p>penis to be cut off and for both of them to eat it they</p>
<p>he want to share</p>
<p>the imitation</p>
<p>of the penis</p>
<p>brandon said that this was a big fantasy of his</p>
<p>to chop off his wiener</p>
<p>dream big they say</p>
<p>dream big i forgot to say if you hear humming i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i had to turn on my fan</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s gets so hot in this room with my</p>
<p>lights that</p>
<p>i was melting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got me nervous</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s to come with summertime approaching</p>
<p>so if you hear humming i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry um but a</p>
<p>bitch is hot</p>
<p>anyways so brandes was telling armin</p>
<p>his fantasies</p>
<p>and armin as</p>
<p>crazy as it sounds</p>
<p>in interviews</p>
<p>he said that he didn&rsquo;t want to be disrespectful</p>
<p>and not do anything that wasn&rsquo;t of the</p>
<p>volunteers wishes so if</p>
<p>a volunteer wanted to be</p>
<p>eaten a certain way</p>
<p>he would make sure and do that</p>
<p>for the volunteer</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t want to disrespect at all</p>
<p>so brandes is telling armin</p>
<p>i want my dick to be eaten</p>
<p>so march 9th 2001 brandes</p>
<p>who has been communicating with armin</p>
<p>for a while now</p>
<p>they set a date they set a plan</p>
<p>march 9th come out here</p>
<p>armin&rsquo;s place</p>
<p>and we will</p>
<p>feast we will eat</p>
<p>so once brandis gets there</p>
<p>they have sexual relations</p>
<p>right armin</p>
<p>gives brandis</p>
<p>a bunch of sleeping pills and he gives him some vicks</p>
<p>and he gives him some alcohol</p>
<p>and the reason he does this is because</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>brandis to be in any pain</p>
<p>and he thinks that this will help with the pain now</p>
<p>brandis takes the</p>
<p>sleeping pills</p>
<p>and alcohol and</p>
<p>everything willingly like he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sneaking it into his</p>
<p>drink or his food or anything that armin</p>
<p>tells brandis that this is</p>
<p>gonna help with the pain</p>
<p>will help so you don&rsquo;t really feel anything armin tells</p>
<p>brandis ahead of time that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna film the process</p>
<p>so he can watch it over and over and over</p>
<p>again and get that sick thrill</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s looking to get</p>
<p>and like probably</p>
<p>take his pants off to it or something so armin</p>
<p>sets up the</p>
<p>video camera</p>
<p>brandis he lays down on the</p>
<p>table armin</p>
<p>then decides</p>
<p>besides we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start with the penis</p>
<p>first we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna chop off your penis</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re both gonna eat it together armin has the</p>
<p>video recorder goin</p>
<p>starts to cut off the</p>
<p>penis in an interview armin says brandis</p>
<p>screamed horribly</p>
<p>but it was short</p>
<p>maybe 20 to 30</p>
<p>seconds and that</p>
<p>blood was squirting from the open wound</p>
<p>similar to a fountain</p>
<p>these are his words</p>
<p>but they got the penis off and</p>
<p>so armin decides to then cook the</p>
<p>penis because you know like that was the wish</p>
<p>he goes over into the</p>
<p>kitchen goes to the little</p>
<p>the stovetop</p>
<p>thing he puts</p>
<p>a little bit of garlic some salt some pepper</p>
<p>chop up the wiener puts it in there some oil</p>
<p>flipping it</p>
<p>so after cooking the the wiener he</p>
<p>serves it to</p>
<p>brandon&rsquo;s himself</p>
<p>on a nice plate</p>
<p>feeds it to him armin says that the penis</p>
<p>tastes disgusting it was</p>
<p>super chewy</p>
<p>and it just wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>edible and he was pretty bummed</p>
<p>he said it was really</p>
<p>disappointing</p>
<p>but it just was not edible</p>
<p>brandezz is</p>
<p>bleeding a lot creating a mess</p>
<p>armin decides to put</p>
<p>brandes into the bathtub</p>
<p>that way he</p>
<p>could like run the</p>
<p>water and it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be so</p>
<p>messy because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bleeding he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna let him</p>
<p>bleed out essentially</p>
<p>and he sits in the bathtub and he just waits it out</p>
<p>every 15 minutes</p>
<p>armin would go and like</p>
<p>check on him in the bathtub</p>
<p>he said that</p>
<p>it was a really slow process like he thought he was</p>
<p>gonna die a lot faster but he was just</p>
<p>dying at a slow pace and</p>
<p>so he busted out his star trek book i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>lying this is what he said in the interview</p>
<p>his star trek book</p>
<p>you know kill the time</p>
<p>read this book</p>
<p>and waited out</p>
<p>until brenda&rsquo;s died he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dying fast enough</p>
<p>so about after like three</p>
<p>hours armin just goes in there he says</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna slit your</p>
<p>throat because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking too long to die gives brenda&rsquo;s</p>
<p>piss and then he slits his throat</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s just a lot</p>
<p>going on in this</p>
<p>story to the</p>
<p>point where like it&rsquo;s really hard to believe okay once</p>
<p>brandis has died that&rsquo;s when armin</p>
<p>now gets to work he takes his body out of the tub</p>
<p>and he chops</p>
<p>brandis into pieces</p>
<p>he puts part of him in the freezer</p>
<p>and then he buries the</p>
<p>skull in the garden</p>
<p>in an interview</p>
<p>armin says that he decorated the</p>
<p>table with nice candles</p>
<p>i took out my best dinner service</p>
<p>and i fried a</p>
<p>piece of rump</p>
<p>steak a piece from his back</p>
<p>made what i call princess potatoes</p>
<p>and sprouts</p>
<p>after i prepared my meal i ate it</p>
<p>these are his quotes</p>
<p>he then goes on to say the</p>
<p>first bite was of course very strange</p>
<p>it was a feeling i can&rsquo;t really describe</p>
<p>i spent over 40 years longing for it</p>
<p>dreaming about it</p>
<p>and now i was getting the feeling</p>
<p>that i was actually</p>
<p>achieving this perfect interconnection</p>
<p>through his</p>
<p>flesh the flesh</p>
<p>tastes like pork</p>
<p>stronger he then um</p>
<p>stored a lot of the</p>
<p>pieces of the body like in little ziploc</p>
<p>bags he put them in his</p>
<p>freezer he hid them</p>
<p>underneath a bunch of</p>
<p>pizza boxes</p>
<p>and he would</p>
<p>spend the next six to</p>
<p>eight months</p>
<p>eating parts of the body</p>
<p>he would add it as</p>
<p>pizza topping</p>
<p>he would eat some for breakfast he was just</p>
<p>using this as</p>
<p>his food supply</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what to say to that i really don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so i forgot to say armin</p>
<p>took video footage of this</p>
<p>whole process right</p>
<p>but then he also took</p>
<p>photos of the process as well</p>
<p>armin then went on to his cannibal</p>
<p>websites again</p>
<p>and he uploaded these</p>
<p>photos of brandes</p>
<p>onto the website and</p>
<p>his body and of course once again</p>
<p>this website goes</p>
<p>crazy for him they&rsquo;re like oh my god you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the best and they&rsquo;re really idolizing him i mean armin</p>
<p>never acknowledges this but i personally believe</p>
<p>which means nothing but</p>
<p>that he probably</p>
<p>was getting some kind of high from this like</p>
<p>what comes from</p>
<p>a family he really didn&rsquo;t even acknowledge him</p>
<p>to now like being recognized for</p>
<p>something and that probably really made him feel good</p>
<p>late november</p>
<p>early december</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when armin decides</p>
<p>to go back onto his cannibal websites and advertise</p>
<p>again because he wants a new volunteer</p>
<p>his supply is running low he&rsquo;s been eating</p>
<p>all of this meat for the last couple of</p>
<p>months and he needs a new fix he needs some new</p>
<p>fresh meat he posts</p>
<p>on a couple of different cannibal websites</p>
<p>again on this site there was this austrian student who</p>
<p>saw armin&rsquo;s post</p>
<p>and saw the</p>
<p>pictures of the bodies and</p>
<p>stuff and then saw that</p>
<p>armin was looking for a new victim</p>
<p>so he actually tipped off police</p>
<p>letting them know</p>
<p>hey i think this guy actually killed somebody</p>
<p>and on the morning of december 10th 2002 police made a</p>
<p>visit to the mansion</p>
<p>that armand</p>
<p>lived in now police</p>
<p>they go into armand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and they start</p>
<p>snooping around</p>
<p>looking for any type of evidence and they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t coming across anything</p>
<p>which is odd because he had a</p>
<p>slaughter room but</p>
<p>maybe they just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make it upstairs</p>
<p>yet we don&rsquo;t know but they get to the refrigerator</p>
<p>and they look in the</p>
<p>freezer and</p>
<p>underneath pizza</p>
<p>boxes they find 50</p>
<p>pounds of meat</p>
<p>and armin tells the police that it&rsquo;s wild pig meat</p>
<p>but then another</p>
<p>police officer looks closer and they notice there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>skin on it still</p>
<p>and so they take the meat out and upon further</p>
<p>inspection they notice that it&rsquo;s human meat</p>
<p>so when the police ask him is this like human meat</p>
<p>armin says yes</p>
<p>and he admits to what he had done</p>
<p>and he tells him</p>
<p>about the photos and the vhs</p>
<p>showing what he had done and</p>
<p>armin actually</p>
<p>never once denies what he</p>
<p>the only time he did deny something was</p>
<p>when the police showed up he didn&rsquo;t confess that it was</p>
<p>human meat in the</p>
<p>freezer he said it was wild pig</p>
<p>but other than that he was very honest</p>
<p>told them exactly what happened</p>
<p>showed them</p>
<p>where the tapes were at</p>
<p>gave him his computer</p>
<p>everything police arrest him</p>
<p>naturally as they</p>
<p>should on january</p>
<p>30th 2004 armin</p>
<p>was convicted of manslaughter</p>
<p>and he was only sentenced to</p>
<p>eight and a half years in prison</p>
<p>look real talk that made a lot of people upset</p>
<p>okay so this case picked up a huge amount of media</p>
<p>coverage and people were outraged but</p>
<p>armins defense and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s actually pretty damn</p>
<p>strong was that brandes</p>
<p>was willing</p>
<p>he volunteered all of the</p>
<p>email correspondence that investigators have</p>
<p>found he actually</p>
<p>drove out to armand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house is like more</p>
<p>proof it also proved problematic for german lawyers</p>
<p>who discovered that cannibalism is in fact</p>
<p>legal in germany</p>
<p>so instead they</p>
<p>charged armin with murder</p>
<p>for the purposes of</p>
<p>sexual pleasure</p>
<p>and with disturbing the</p>
<p>peace of the dead</p>
<p>they ended up showing the</p>
<p>court 19 minutes of the</p>
<p>video that armin took</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m sure probably ruined a lot of people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>because i couldn&rsquo;t imagine what they saw on that tape</p>
<p>their argument was that he</p>
<p>should have been convicted</p>
<p>of murder and not manslaughter</p>
<p>and also that he</p>
<p>should be given a life sentence</p>
<p>not eight years</p>
<p>so in the retrial they</p>
<p>thought that</p>
<p>brandez was not in the</p>
<p>right mind to be able to give consent</p>
<p>and then finally may 10 2006</p>
<p>armin was convicted</p>
<p>of murder and was sentenced to life in prison</p>
<p>afterwards armin</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in prison now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in prison</p>
<p>he actually became</p>
<p>a vegetarian</p>
<p>so he doesn&rsquo;t eat meat anymore</p>
<p>and he has done interviews</p>
<p>which you can find easily on youtube</p>
<p>and in these interviews he&rsquo;s very calm</p>
<p>like very well</p>
<p>spoken he would not even</p>
<p>hell there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about doing</p>
<p>these murder mystery</p>
<p>things is that nobody</p>
<p>ever looks like a killer but they&rsquo;re probably a killer</p>
<p>so he looks normal normal</p>
<p>as hell but he&rsquo;s a fucking killer and yeah he seems</p>
<p>good i guess i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he says what he did was</p>
<p>wrong and he acknowledges that so yeah</p>
<p>i mean this is germany to like i have no idea how</p>
<p>their legal</p>
<p>system works i don&rsquo;t even know how our</p>
<p>legal system</p>
<p>works for christ&rsquo;s sakes don&rsquo;t know what the hell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on over there</p>
<p>harmony so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story about armand mavis</p>
<p>let me know what you</p>
<p>think of the</p>
<p>story down below</p>
<p>i would i would ask the question do you</p>
<p>think he deserved life in prison</p>
<p>but i have a feeling everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to say yes</p>
<p>a piece of advice</p>
<p>would be anyone who looks really normal to you they</p>
<p>could potentially be a murderer</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t be judgmental</p>
<p>but other than that i hope you have a very good day</p>
<p>today you make good choices</p>
<p>be safe out there i&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
