    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,</p>
<p>where I and an expert guest discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is the fifth in a six episode series</p>
<p>on fitness, exercise, and performance.</p>
<p>And today&rsquo;s episode is all about recovery.</p>
<p>That is how to maximize your recovery</p>
<p>to achieve your fitness and exercise and performance goals</p>
<p>and how to avoid overtraining.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re discussing recovery.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very excited to have this discussion</p>
<p>because as we know,</p>
<p>despite the fact that different types of exercise</p>
<p>can be used to trigger different types of adaptation,</p>
<p>such as increased long distance, endurance,</p>
<p>anaerobic capacity, strength, hypertrophy, et cetera,</p>
<p>the workouts themselves are not actually</p>
<p>when the progress occurs,</p>
<p>when the adaptation occurs.</p>
<p>And this to me is extremely interesting</p>
<p>because it parallels what we see</p>
<p>with so-called neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which is the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>We sit down to learn something,</p>
<p>we experience something,</p>
<p>and that is the trigger for rewiring of the nervous system.</p>
<p>But the actual rewiring occurs away</p>
<p>from the experience or the learning.</p>
<p>So to, in fitness and in exercise,</p>
<p>recovery is where the real results actually emerge,</p>
<p>where we get better.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love for you to explain what recovery really is</p>
<p>and the different types of recovery,</p>
<p>certainly different ways to enhance recovery.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d also love for you to explain</p>
<p>whether or not there are ways</p>
<p>that people can become better at recovering.</p>
<p>Because if indeed recovery is when progress emerges,</p>
<p>when we get better,</p>
<p>well then anything that supports our recovery</p>
<p>and gets us better at recovering</p>
<p>ought to increase our rate and our degree of progress.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you nailed it in the description.</p>
<p>What people really want is some sort of change.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re talking athletes or general population,</p>
<p>this change is some sort of improvement in muscle function,</p>
<p>reduction in body fat, higher functioning, metabolism,</p>
<p>whatever the case is.</p>
<p>And the only way that happens is,</p>
<p>we talk about the equation of stress causes adaptation,</p>
<p>but as you alluded to,</p>
<p>the piece in the middle is only if you can recover from it.</p>
<p>And so the game we&rsquo;re playing here is,</p>
<p>we all agree we want more adaptation.</p>
<p>That means we need to bring more stress into the system,</p>
<p>but we then have to ensure</p>
<p>that our recovery outpaces the stress input</p>
<p>or else no adaptation will occur.</p>
<p>In fact, what happens is you will actually</p>
<p>be in a negative spot and you start going backwards.</p>
<p>And so what I would love to do</p>
<p>is talk about how we&rsquo;ve handled this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had a decent amount of experience here.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to do my master&rsquo;s degree</p>
<p>in the laboratory of a gentleman named Andy Fry,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an NSCA Lifetime Achievement Award winner.</p>
<p>And he studied in large part,</p>
<p>recovery, over-training, overuse, overload,</p>
<p>in a lot of areas.</p>
<p>In addition, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to work with individuals from high-functioning CEOs</p>
<p>and executives who have little time for recovery,</p>
<p>high job stress, to athletes.</p>
<p>Think of the example of pitchers in Major League Baseball</p>
<p>who have to recover in a matter of four days</p>
<p>so that they can pitch again at maximum velocity.</p>
<p>So I would love to outline some of the tools and tactics,</p>
<p>strategies that we use for all these individuals,</p>
<p>give you some foundational stuff.</p>
<p>And I would love to maybe actually cover some things</p>
<p>that most people have never heard of,</p>
<p>some stuff you may not have access to,</p>
<p>some technologies that we use, some biomarkers,</p>
<p>and then even a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>that are, keeping with the theme of your show here,</p>
<p>cost-free or extremely low cost.</p>
<p>So all of those strategies.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d also like to do is cover nutrition,</p>
<p>and supplementation, and fueling, and hydration, and things,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably gonna have to be saved</p>
<p>for an additional conversation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll do in the next episode.</p>
<p>Yes, so we will absolutely hold a conversation</p>
<p>about nutrition and supplementation,</p>
<p>where you can educate us about all the top contour stuff,</p>
<p>all the way down to the fine details.</p>
<p>I do have a question about recovery,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that I think most people</p>
<p>are familiar with themselves, which is soreness.</p>
<p>We think of it as a muscle soreness,</p>
<p>but I was trained early on in my scientific career</p>
<p>to always question the seemingly obvious.</p>
<p>So a couple of questions about soreness.</p>
<p>First of all, what does soreness really reflect?</p>
<p>Is it really muscle soreness?</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s in the muscles,</p>
<p>but what other organ systems, and tissues, and cell types</p>
<p>does it involve?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m particularly interested in this concept,</p>
<p>or this experience that many of us, including myself,</p>
<p>had, which is delayed onset muscle soreness.</p>
<p>Why would it be that when we are less in shape,</p>
<p>or when we perform a movement</p>
<p>that is extremely novel to us,</p>
<p>the soreness seems to arrive after a reasonable delay</p>
<p>of maybe even a day, you know, we&rsquo;re fine the next day,</p>
<p>but then 48 hours later, we are exceedingly sore.</p>
<p>And as we get more fit, or more familiar with a movement,</p>
<p>the soreness seems to arrive earlier.</p>
<p>So I realized I just asked you about three questions,</p>
<p>or more.</p>
<p>First of all, what is muscle soreness?</p>
<p>At a cellular level, which cells,</p>
<p>which organ systems, and so forth.</p>
<p>What does it mean if we are sore,</p>
<p>is something I know we&rsquo;ll get into a little bit later.</p>
<p>And then why the delayed onset muscle soreness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually one question.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s totally fine you asked all three,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m gonna actually answer number three,</p>
<p>which will answer number two,</p>
<p>which will actually answer number one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to tell you that I set it up</p>
<p>that way intentionally,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just happy to hear</p>
<p>that where I was unable to be concise,</p>
<p>you are able to be concise.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>We are still learning a lot about this area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really difficult to perform these studies.</p>
<p>Anytime you ask a question about something like pain,</p>
<p>or soreness, you&rsquo;re immediately talking about perception.</p>
<p>And there is obviously a physical component to that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also perception.</p>
<p>And so teasing those things out</p>
<p>is extraordinarily challenging.</p>
<p>That said, there has been a lot of work in this area.</p>
<p>In fact, probably you may have a show already out on pain,</p>
<p>or maybe one&rsquo;s coming down the road.</p>
<p>We did an episode on pain a while ago,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely time to revisit that literature.</p>
<p>I also have some amazing colleagues at Stanford</p>
<p>who work on pain,</p>
<p>both from the cellular and molecular side,</p>
<p>but also from the psychological side</p>
<p>about how our understanding of pain</p>
<p>and what we believe about pain</p>
<p>shapes the experience of pain and pain relief.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>That stuff is incredibly important,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m glad we flagged that,</p>
<p>and maybe we&rsquo;ll just call that good for now.</p>
<p>They can come back later for another one of your shows.</p>
<p>So that being said,</p>
<p>why does it happen 28 to 48 hours after you exercise?</p>
<p>Well, that actually should give you some clues</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So the traditional dogma of delayed onset muscle soreness,</p>
<p>is what this is called,</p>
<p>is that it is a result of quote-unquote micro tears</p>
<p>in the muscle.</p>
<p>And so you can sort of think, I challenged the muscle,</p>
<p>there were some small tears in there,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m feeling the results of that.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, that certainly does happen,</p>
<p>and it can happen.</p>
<p>That is not what&rsquo;s explaining your muscle soreness.</p>
<p>And in fact, you can be quite sore from exercise</p>
<p>and have no measurable amount of muscle damage.</p>
<p>And so much like anything else,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in this idea of pain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a one-to-one explanation.</p>
<p>There are multiple factors</p>
<p>that are probably causing your perception of pain.</p>
<p>Muscle damage can be one of them.</p>
<p>It is not the only one,</p>
<p>and it is probably, in my opinion,</p>
<p>though this is yet to be shown definitively,</p>
<p>probably not even the leading cause of it.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s actually happening?</p>
<p>Well, the reason it&rsquo;s taking you 24 to 48 hours</p>
<p>is you can actually find various papers,</p>
<p>literature reviews dating back in a number of years now,</p>
<p>over a decade,</p>
<p>that show these wonderful curves</p>
<p>of an inflammatory and immune response.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t need to necessarily go through</p>
<p>the entire physiology right now,</p>
<p>but effectively what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>those things have a little bit of a time delay.</p>
<p>And so some of those steps happen immediately,</p>
<p>like right when the exercise is there,</p>
<p>and then some of them are delayed six to 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>If you know a little bit about this physiology,</p>
<p>you have a combination of neutrophils and macrophages</p>
<p>and a bunch of things happening,</p>
<p>and this has a time sequence.</p>
<p>So what happens is by the time we get</p>
<p>to this 28 to 48 hour window,</p>
<p>now the muscle soreness kicks in.</p>
<p>Which, wait a minute,</p>
<p>if this was a result of my muscles being torn,</p>
<p>and that happened immediately,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that pain start immediately?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is it would.</p>
<p>And so that is your first clue</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not responsible for it.</p>
<p>When we look at that immune response</p>
<p>and we see that that has actually peaked</p>
<p>24 to 48 hours later,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s the same time the pain kicked in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s calling you in at the problem.</p>
<p>So we have this immune response happening in inflammation,</p>
<p>then all of a sudden we start getting fluid accumulation.</p>
<p>And now there are what are called nociceptors,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re probably very,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re very familiar with these,</p>
<p>and these are your pain receptors.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s actually interesting is we don&rsquo;t necessarily know</p>
<p>a lot of information</p>
<p>about how many pain receptors are in muscle.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really in the belly.</p>
<p>In fact, this is why I can perform my muscle biopsies</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really hurt.</p>
<p>You mean in the belly of the muscle?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>We do have pressure sensors though.</p>
<p>And so if you change the volume of the tissue,</p>
<p>you will respond to that very, very quickly.</p>
<p>So by enhancing swelling in the actual muscle,</p>
<p>that is immediately putting pressure</p>
<p>on those pressure receptors, if you will.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the signal.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s probably happened here,</p>
<p>and I just hate to give you another bone,</p>
<p>but a lot of delayed on some muscle soreness</p>
<p>is probably just a neural feedback loop</p>
<p>rather than it is actual muscle damage.</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interactions</p>
<p>between the types of neurons</p>
<p>that control touch sensation</p>
<p>and pain sensation and itch sensation.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of people kind of collapse</p>
<p>itch and pain together.</p>
<p>Bingo, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s something it&rsquo;s painful</p>
<p>and it itches is a familiar thing for people,</p>
<p>mosquito bites and such.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s the classic gate theory of pain,</p>
<p>which people will be familiar with.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll explain why I&rsquo;m explaining this,</p>
<p>which is if something hurts,</p>
<p>you bonk your knee or you stub your toe,</p>
<p>we tend to grab that body part and try and rub it.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And that rubbing is not a coincidental thing.</p>
<p>It activates a set of touch sensors</p>
<p>that respond to kind of broad, dull touch.</p>
<p>And that actively inhibits</p>
<p>through the release of an inhibitory neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>the fibers that control the pain signal.</p>
<p>So anytime we rub like a Charlie horse our leg</p>
<p>or we stub our toe and we, you know,</p>
<p>we wince and then we grab the toe</p>
<p>and we kind of like squeezing it a little bit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually deactivating</p>
<p>or partially inactivating the pain mechanism.</p>
<p>So the idea that a swelling response</p>
<p>would then trigger a neural response</p>
<p>that then would recruit the pain receptor response,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m using broad brush strokes here to explain this,</p>
<p>makes very good sense to me.</p>
<p>Now and only now that you&rsquo;ve explained</p>
<p>how this process works.</p>
<p>I can actually even add more to that.</p>
<p>So if you remember how muscles work,</p>
<p>so we have to have some sort of signal</p>
<p>from the nervous system that has to actually go in</p>
<p>and tell the muscle to contract.</p>
<p>Well, remember there a few episodes ago,</p>
<p>we covered the physiology here</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called a motor unit.</p>
<p>Okay, well, what I didn&rsquo;t explain to</p>
<p>are called muscle spindles.</p>
<p>And we have talked about proprioception</p>
<p>in an episode of before as well,</p>
<p>but we never tied this picture together.</p>
<p>So let me walk you through that really quickly</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna tie this loop into a nice bow.</p>
<p>So what happens is this motor unit</p>
<p>is coming in from what&rsquo;s called an alpha motor unit,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna be innervating your muscle fibers</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna tell the muscle fibers to contract.</p>
<p>Those are typically spread out</p>
<p>throughout all sides of the muscle,</p>
<p>in interior, exterior, all over.</p>
<p>On the outside though,</p>
<p>there is another type of muscle called a muscle spindle.</p>
<p>Now these are non-contractile,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t have that actin and myosin</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t produce force.</p>
<p>They are responsive, they are proprioceptive.</p>
<p>So what that means is they sense stretch.</p>
<p>And this is why, for example,</p>
<p>if you were to stretch a hamstring</p>
<p>and stretch any muscle group,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter or muscle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s innate response is to fire back,</p>
<p>to close that distance.</p>
<p>And this is what keeps you from,</p>
<p>say, if you&rsquo;re leaning to the right,</p>
<p>you can imagine that the example we give</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re standing on one foot</p>
<p>and you start swaying to the right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re standing on your right foot</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s make this easier for folks.</p>
<p>And you start swaying to the right,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re gonna fall on your right ear,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll hit the ground.</p>
<p>The inside of your right calf muscle</p>
<p>will start being stretched.</p>
<p>The outside will start being compressed.</p>
<p>So the stretch on the inside of the right calf muscle</p>
<p>will sense that stretch</p>
<p>and it will respond by contracting</p>
<p>that pulls you back to the middle</p>
<p>and stops you from falling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s proprioception.</p>
<p>And muscle spindle sends stretch</p>
<p>and tell you to contract.</p>
<p>The way that they work is through gamma motor neurons.</p>
<p>And so these are sensory things.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening is,</p>
<p>unlike when you tell your muscle to contract,</p>
<p>it goes alpha to the muscle, contract.</p>
<p>These muscle spindles work such that it is,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;ve been stretched,</p>
<p>send signal back to some central point,</p>
<p>typically in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t actually wanna go all the way up to the brain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a time delay.</p>
<p>This is why these are subconscious,</p>
<p>autonomic, right, versus somatic.</p>
<p>So the gamma is gonna go back to the central location</p>
<p>and then come back through the alpha motor neurons</p>
<p>and tell it to contract.</p>
<p>So you have this wonderful mechanism</p>
<p>of sensing stretch going back.</p>
<p>Well, one theory that&rsquo;s been put forward</p>
<p>regarding muscle damage</p>
<p>is that the pressure is actually being applied</p>
<p>to those nerve endings of the muscle spindles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually responsible for the pain signal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going back and coming up to your brain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re registering that as pain</p>
<p>rather than it is actually in the contractile units,</p>
<p>so the muscle fibers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very intriguing idea</p>
<p>because it would suggest that stretching muscles</p>
<p>in order to alleviate soreness</p>
<p>might be the exact incorrect thing to do.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s for certain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just building off the mechanistic logic</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve laid out here,</p>
<p>really that you&rsquo;ve laid out here.</p>
<p>There is a more effective principle based on exactly that,</p>
<p>which is this is generally why low-level movement</p>
<p>is effective at reducing acute soreness.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s low-level contraction of the muscles.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna contract-</p>
<p>Anti-stretch.</p>
<p>And get tissue out and get fluid out.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally pumping it out of the cell.</p>
<p>Yes, and in our previous episode</p>
<p>where we were talking about programming,</p>
<p>or I keep using the we,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s be fair here,</p>
<p>where you were educating us,</p>
<p>including me and the audience</p>
<p>about different structures for programming,</p>
<p>exercise for specific adaptations, et cetera,</p>
<p>month, week, year, scales, et cetera.</p>
<p>We had a brief discussion about the fact</p>
<p>that if one trains legs very hard with resistance training,</p>
<p>you know, some heavy squatting or deadlifting it,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some soreness,</p>
<p>that oftentimes doing some, quote, unquote, lighter cardio,</p>
<p>or some low-impact work the next day,</p>
<p>or any number of different things</p>
<p>that involve not high intensity</p>
<p>contractions of the muscles,</p>
<p>but that do require contractions of the muscles,</p>
<p>that it can alleviate soreness more quickly</p>
<p>than if one were to simply lie around</p>
<p>and watch Netflix or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>To go back just a little bit as well,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s really the case,</p>
<p>the question is like,</p>
<p>where is this inflammatory signal coming from?</p>
<p>And while there&rsquo;s much to be learned there,</p>
<p>there is a little bit of information right now</p>
<p>that suggests it&rsquo;s potentially coming from free radicals</p>
<p>released from the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Again, that may or may not hold up as more research comes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But if you remember back to our conversation on endurance,</p>
<p>so we talked about the electron transport chain</p>
<p>and aerobic metabolism,</p>
<p>and regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting energy from glycolysis or carbohydrates,</p>
<p>remember, they have to be finished</p>
<p>through aerobic metabolism.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re lifting weights</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re using carbs for your fuel,</p>
<p>you have got to finish that metabolism</p>
<p>by running it into the mitochondria</p>
<p>and performing oxidative metabolism.</p>
<p>As a result of that,</p>
<p>that electron transport chain runs.</p>
<p>So theoretically, if free radicals,</p>
<p>which are hyperreactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>basically they&rsquo;re oxygen molecules</p>
<p>that are missing electrons</p>
<p>so that they react to a lot of things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the opposite of antioxidants, by the way.</p>
<p>This is the oxygen molecules with extra protons</p>
<p>so they can balance the charge.</p>
<p>If those leak out,</p>
<p>that in and of itself is going to be</p>
<p>a massive inflammatory signal,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably what signals</p>
<p>the cause of these neutrophils and macrophages</p>
<p>and kicks off this entire cascade.</p>
<p>Again, I believe we need more research there.</p>
<p>I need to look into it.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s more definitive than I know,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>potentially what&rsquo;s happening, rather,</p>
<p>that causes that cascade and signal.</p>
<p>Also, what you have is this combination of,</p>
<p>well, if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>why am I not getting tremendous amount of muscle damage</p>
<p>when I do more aerobic-based exercise?</p>
<p>Well, because you don&rsquo;t have the mechanical tension</p>
<p>pulling on the fibers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually causing damage to the cell wall</p>
<p>that allows these free radicals</p>
<p>to escape the mitochondria and the cell wall.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the best we can postulate at this moment</p>
<p>as to why those things are happening,</p>
<p>and then why, again, low-level exercise tends to enhance,</p>
<p>even things like percussion.</p>
<p>So using either instruments</p>
<p>that put a low level of vibration into your leg</p>
<p>or like pneumatic boots so you can massage,</p>
<p>all of these things are generally probably helping</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re moving that stuff out,</p>
<p>edema most specifically,</p>
<p>so pressure comes off of those nerve endings</p>
<p>and the muscle spindles</p>
<p>and allows you to stop receiving that signal of pain</p>
<p>despite the fact</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t actually regenerate tissue at all yet.</p>
<p>Fascinating, and I think that beautifully frames</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re headed next,</p>
<p>which is to talk about all the different modes of recovery</p>
<p>and how to accelerate them,</p>
<p>and perhaps even how to combine different forms of recovery</p>
<p>in order to become better at recovering,</p>
<p>and in doing so, make faster progress with fitness.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of our desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Momentus.</p>
<p>Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering</p>
<p>with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>their supplements are of extremely high quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, their supplements are generally</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to develop a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to focus mainly</p>
<p>on using single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>With single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>you can devise the most logical and effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>and this is, of course, important because we realize</p>
<p>that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners</p>
<p>reside outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try the various supplements</p>
<p>mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>in particular supplements for hormone health,</p>
<p>for sleep optimization, for focus,</p>
<p>as well as a number of other things,</p>
<p>including exercise recovery,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that contains the exact ratios of the electrolytes,</p>
<p>sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>to optimize cellular functioning</p>
<p>for mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Most people realize that hydration is key.</p>
<p>We need to ingest enough fluids</p>
<p>in order to feel our best and perform our best.</p>
<p>But what most people do not realize</p>
<p>is that the proper functioning of our cells</p>
<p>and nerve cells, neurons in particular,</p>
<p>requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present</p>
<p>in the correct ratios.</p>
<p>Now, of course, people with prehypertension</p>
<p>and hypertension need to be careful</p>
<p>about their sodium intake.</p>
<p>But what a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise,</p>
<p>and in particular, if you&rsquo;re following a very clean diet,</p>
<p>that is not a lot of processed foods,</p>
<p>which of course is a good thing,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re not getting enough sodium,</p>
<p>potassium, and magnesium</p>
<p>to optimize mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1,000 milligrams,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>for about the last eight months,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sleeping about the same amount,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sleeping far deeper,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m now getting the proper ratios</p>
<p>of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep,</p>
<p>and slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>and waking up feeling far more recovered</p>
<p>mentally and physically.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism for all that</p>
<p>is very straightforward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere</p>
<p>about the critical relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and body temperature.</p>
<p>That is, in order to fall asleep at night,</p>
<p>your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees</p>
<p>in terms of core body temperature,</p>
<p>and waking up involves a one to three degree increase</p>
<p>in core body temperature.</p>
<p>With Eight Sleep mattress covers,</p>
<p>you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment</p>
<p>to be one temperature at the start of the night,</p>
<p>a different temperature the middle of the night,</p>

<p>So to kick off this discussion about recovery</p>
<p>and with the understanding that recovery</p>
<p>is when the specific adaptations to exercise actually occur,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to share with us</p>
<p>what happens or needs to happen during recovery</p>
<p>in order for us to get better at anything,</p>
<p>endurance, strength, et cetera,</p>
<p>but also how specific types of exercise stimuli</p>
<p>and specific types of adaptations that we trigger,</p>
<p>so running a bit further, lifting a bit more weight,</p>
<p>slowing the cadence of a given movement, et cetera,</p>
<p>how those specific types of triggers for adaptation</p>
<p>relate to the specific or maybe similar types of recovery</p>
<p>that are required for us to make progress.</p>
<p>In one of our previous episodes,</p>
<p>we were talking about how the Harvard Fatigue Lab</p>
<p>really identified this idea of homeostasis</p>
<p>or at least sort of championed it for it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important because in all levels,</p>
<p>physiology wants to return to homeostasis.</p>
<p>So what happens in terms of adaptation</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve challenged it to a level</p>
<p>that it realizes if it does not make a change,</p>
<p>it will not be able to get back</p>
<p>to the same level of homeostasis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fundamentally what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>That is recovery.</p>
<p>That process of taking an insult,</p>
<p>being temporarily reduced in functionality,</p>
<p>causing a change so that now we come back</p>
<p>and get what we often call in sport performance,</p>
<p>super compensation.</p>
<p>All that really is doing though</p>
<p>is bringing you to a new level of homeostasis.</p>
<p>Effectively, it is understanding</p>
<p>if that same insult comes again,</p>
<p>I need to be able to make sure</p>
<p>that that doesn&rsquo;t cause the same level of disruption.</p>
<p>And so we raise the bar,</p>
<p>whether this is enhancing our ability</p>
<p>to take the same level of mechanical tension on the muscle</p>
<p>and not result in micro damage,</p>
<p>whether this is being able to take</p>
<p>the same reduction in energy</p>
<p>and not have that compromise of sleep or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fundamentally changing</p>
<p>so that we can have a new level of homeostasis</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s presuming, it&rsquo;s predicting</p>
<p>that that same insult is going to come again down the road.</p>
<p>I wanted to clarify for people</p>
<p>that when Dr. Galvin says insult,</p>
<p>while he may actually insult me,</p>
<p>insult is the nerd speak terminology</p>
<p>for some sort of damage inflicted to a tissue or system.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s speaking about the insult to the muscle</p>
<p>or insult to the neuromuscular connection</p>
<p>created by adding more weight to the bar,</p>
<p>running a further distance,</p>
<p>running a bit faster or pedaling faster.</p>
<p>That creates a micro insult or an insult.</p>
<p>And now because everyone is familiar</p>
<p>with psychological and verbal insults,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never forget that biological concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important we tag another thing here,</p>
<p>which is called hormesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite phenomenon.</p>
<p>And it effectively means this,</p>
<p>that there is a dosage or toxicity response</p>
<p>to almost everything.</p>
<p>And if you think about this in the context of say drugs,</p>
<p>what this means is if I gave you 10 milligrams of something</p>
<p>that it would be okay.</p>
<p>But if I give you 20, it&rsquo;d be a problem.</p>
<p>And eventually if I go up and give you enough,</p>
<p>this thing turns toxic.</p>
<p>This is a case of everything from cyanide,</p>
<p>where it can actually be in small dosages in nature.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s in many of the fruits that you eat,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at a dosage that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If that dosage gets higher though,</p>
<p>that actually can cause problems.</p>
<p>And if it is high enough,</p>
<p>it can actually kill you instantaneously.</p>
<p>The backend of that though is</p>
<p>because you introduce this micro insult,</p>
<p>as you framed it for me perfectly,</p>
<p>your body will then adapt to it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with exercise adaptation</p>
<p>is it is a hormetic stressor.</p>
<p>And why that&rsquo;s important is</p>
<p>if you look at the immediate responses to exercise,</p>
<p>you see an extremely large increase in inflammation.</p>
<p>You see oxidative stress.</p>
<p>You see a whole cascade of autophagy.</p>
<p>Like all these problems, quote unquote, happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that what&rsquo;s actually quite funny here is</p>
<p>as a part of my PhD, the academic portion,</p>
<p>I had to go through the medical side of the school.</p>
<p>And so I was, my physiology class was in med school.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the only non-medical doctor in that class, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a PhD.</p>
<p>So I leave my lab, I walk across campus</p>
<p>and I take physiology class with these folks.</p>
<p>And I died the whole time internally</p>
<p>because every time we would cover a new area,</p>
<p>it was basically the exact same value or number</p>
<p>in a medical setting is like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, they&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>And in a performance setting is like,</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s in fantastic shape.</p>
<p>It still amuses me to this day, obviously,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just simple things like total blood volume, right?</p>
<p>And you cover like, okay, if you have a patient come in,</p>
<p>their blood volume is six liters.</p>
<p>You know, I can immediately get them on a diuretic</p>
<p>of some sort, because they&rsquo;re going to have a heart attack</p>
<p>as blood pressure gets up, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m immediately thinking, damn, six liters,</p>
<p>that person is super fit.</p>
<p>Because that is actually a positive adaptation to training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most important,</p>
<p>if not the most important adaptation to endurance training</p>
<p>is enhanced total blood volume.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll store more blood in your body</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re more fit than you are less fit.</p>
<p>So I make it go on.</p>
<p>All these things, sodium concentrations,</p>
<p>potassium concentrations are like,</p>
<p>you look at these things on paper</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know if that person&rsquo;s about to die</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re 65 years old and out of shape,</p>
<p>or if that person&rsquo;s going to break</p>
<p>a world record in the marathon.</p>
<p>This brings up a very important tangent,</p>
<p>which is, for instance, if you go and take a blood test</p>
<p>and you are somebody who exercises very intensely</p>
<p>with resistance training,</p>
<p>your blood creatinine levels can be way out of range.</p>
<p>And if your physician doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing certain forms of exercise,</p>
<p>they might say, wow, there&rsquo;s a lot of muscle tissue damage</p>
<p>occurring in your body.</p>
<p>As you mentioned before,</p>
<p>your total blood volume is dangerously high</p>
<p>when in fact you are far healthier and much fitter</p>
<p>than the person whose numbers would be in range.</p>
<p>That said, obviously there are limits to these statements</p>
<p>whereby you would want to be cautious</p>
<p>and take action to ameliorate a very elevated</p>
<p>blood creatinine level or something of that sort.</p>
<p>But the point you&rsquo;re bringing up</p>
<p>is also one about the field of medicine,</p>
<p>which is that many, not all,</p>
<p>but many physicians don&rsquo;t take into consideration</p>
<p>the outside activities that people are doing.</p>
<p>And so it becomes a kind of a plug and play type way</p>
<p>of looking at blood charts.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve done many thousand athletes, blood chemistry,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t use, first of all,</p>
<p>we never look at disease stuff, that&rsquo;s not what we do.</p>
<p>We take people that are healthy</p>
<p>and try to optimize performance.</p>
<p>And blood chemistry is one of the best tools.</p>
<p>If you really understand what you&rsquo;re doing there,</p>
<p>you can get some incredibly powerful information</p>
<p>out of blood chemistry.</p>
<p>That actually relates to what we&rsquo;re gonna talk to today</p>
<p>in terms of measuring everything from acute</p>
<p>to chronic dehydration, to sleep deprivation</p>
<p>can be identified in blood chemistry,</p>
<p>to optimization improvements in nutrition supplementation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot you can get there.</p>
<p>Maybe if people are interested in that field,</p>
<p>I would point them to a gentleman named Dan Garner,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just an absolute juggernaut and wizard</p>
<p>in blood chemistry for high performance.</p>
<p>But you can get a ton of information from that.</p>
<p>If you understand the difference</p>
<p>between exactly what you talked about,</p>
<p>looking for signals of increased risk</p>
<p>of cardiovascular events 25 years down the road</p>
<p>versus is this the optimal value</p>
<p>for high performance in an athlete,</p>
<p>which is what our database and all of our software</p>
<p>and stuff does is only looking for those things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna talk about some of the biomarkers</p>
<p>to look for a little bit later,</p>
<p>salivary stuff, some blood stuff,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll maybe save that part of the conversation</p>
<p>for down the road.</p>
<p>Tell me about different timescales of recovery.</p>
<p>Sure, this is actually where I was trying</p>
<p>to answer your question for</p>
<p>and then I got myself way off track.</p>
<p>But the reason I brought up the hormetic thing</p>
<p>is if you understand that some things in the acute,</p>
<p>say 24 to 48 hour period, look terrible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually fine, right?</p>
<p>So this is the stimuli that&rsquo;s causing adaptation.</p>
<p>So the reason I brought up the medical exchange there</p>
<p>is because if you looked at inflammatory markers</p>
<p>and then you mentioned some of them,</p>
<p>you would see that they are highest acute</p>
<p>within seconds to minutes to hours after exercise.</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s exactly the stimuli needed</p>
<p>to bring them down chronically, okay?</p>
<p>And so chronically meaning maybe in that moment</p>
<p>they are elevated and then maybe they&rsquo;re coming down</p>
<p>24 hours later in 48 hours.</p>
<p>However, if you were to compare your resting level,</p>
<p>say that Monday before you worked out,</p>
<p>to your resting level that Monday,</p>
<p>the week following, the week following that,</p>
<p>what you would probably see</p>
<p>is your baseline inflammation goes down.</p>
<p>And so we gotta be really careful.</p>
<p>Are we talking immediately post exercise?</p>
<p>Man, these markers look terrible.</p>
<p>Maybe my recovery score is awful, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing</p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re looking to do</p>
<p>is to not only change what&rsquo;s happening today,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re trying to cause adaptation</p>
<p>that may take us weeks or months to actually access.</p>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;re highlighting this principle</p>
<p>because one of the more obvious ones to me now</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve said this is heart rate.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>If my heart rate goes very, very high during exercise</p>
<p>and I do that fairly consistently</p>
<p>or even semi-consistently,</p>
<p>my resting heart rate will actually be quite a bit lower.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fantastic example.</p>
<p>Really what you&rsquo;re getting at here is this concept</p>
<p>where I think it&rsquo;s important to differentiate</p>
<p>between adaptation and optimization.</p>
<p>Now we hear that word and I use it</p>
<p>and most scientists hate it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good communication tool, optimization.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re optimizing for the current moment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re almost surely compromising the late adaptation.</p>
<p>If I were to say, do the thing right now</p>
<p>that makes you feel the absolute best in the world,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, great, you took a nap and you ate a donut,</p>
<p>like, awesome, you feel amazing.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s causing long-term issues.</p>
<p>The same can be said in the backend.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re never choosing things</p>
<p>that make you better right now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never actually going to see any adaptation.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really doing with this recovery conversation</p>
<p>is playing this game of balancing immediate gratification</p>
<p>with the late gratification.</p>
<p>And how do we identify how much to do now versus not?</p>
<p>How do I use a value or a marker,</p>
<p>whether this is how tired I feel today,</p>
<p>how sore I am today,</p>
<p>versus a score on an app or a tracking metric,</p>
<p>whether this is a blood marker, anything,</p>
<p>and understand if that&rsquo;s what I need</p>
<p>to cause the adaptation I want a week, a month,</p>
<p>three months from now.</p>
<p>And in the case of some of our other athletes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even up to four years, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to cause adaptations</p>
<p>that will get us where we want to get in the Olympics</p>
<p>or World Championships or World Cup</p>
<p>or wherever we&rsquo;re going to be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the framework we have to think about recovery.</p>
<p>We maybe falsely think about it as,</p>
<p>I need to maximize my recovery today.</p>
<p>And you could do something like take an anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>whether this is a supplementation or a drug,</p>
<p>or maybe this is ice.</p>
<p>Oh, cool, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That will enhance your recovery in this moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll make you feel better today, probably tomorrow.</p>
<p>But what we know is that blocks the signal for adaptation.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not going to get the same results,</p>
<p>you know, four, six, eight weeks from now.</p>
<p>So when we talk about recovery,</p>
<p>we have to understand what tool am I using and why.</p>
<p>And in order to do that,</p>
<p>we have to understand what am I training for</p>
<p>and what am I trying to maximize.</p>
<p>If I am in the middle of a season with an athlete</p>
<p>and we are competing tomorrow,</p>
<p>I am going to hedge towards acute recovery, right?</p>
<p>Cause I have to actuate that performance right now.</p>
<p>If I am starting the off season,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hedging towards recovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually hedging towards adaptation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not going to deploy any of these,</p>
<p>especially things like there&rsquo;s evidence</p>
<p>that a combination of vitamin C and vitamin E</p>
<p>will blunt hypertrophic adaptations</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re anti-inflammatory, they&rsquo;re antioxidants, right?</p>
<p>Other studies have shown</p>
<p>maybe they don&rsquo;t have an inhibitory effect.</p>
<p>They may or may not.</p>
<p>Point is conceptually, you want to be careful</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to optimize for.</p>
<p>And you have to have that forethought</p>
<p>and that alone is going to dictate your decision-making</p>
<p>with whether or not, again, you get in the eyes,</p>
<p>you do that.</p>
<p>We will cover some tools like massage</p>
<p>that are pretty fine to use.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about those blocking</p>
<p>long-term adaptation,</p>
<p>but others you&rsquo;re going to want to be very careful about.</p>
<p>So this principle that you&rsquo;ve laid out for us,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s a set of events</p>
<p>that occur during exercise that trigger the adaptation.</p>
<p>And that sets in motion a number of adaptations</p>
<p>that occur during recovery</p>
<p>that then give us the exact opposite response</p>
<p>to what the trigger was.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll go back to the heart rate example.</p>
<p>Heart rate is close to maximal or maximal.</p>
<p>You do that enough times within a short,</p>
<p>you know, a week or so or two weeks</p>
<p>and your resting heart rate goes down.</p>
<p>As I recall, a few episodes ago,</p>
<p>you said that your maximum heart rate</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really change that much.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, but your resting heart rate can go down quite a bit.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Is that a general theme?</p>
<p>Meaning, do we have a more or less set upper limit</p>
<p>or ceiling for things like inflammatory markers</p>
<p>for heart rate, maybe even things like stress?</p>
<p>And what we do when we deliberately trigger stress</p>
<p>or a dramatic increase in heart rate</p>
<p>or dramatic increase in inflammatory markers</p>
<p>is that we are lowering the floor,</p>
<p>but that the ceiling remains the same?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dependent upon the marker.</p>
<p>So in the case of maximum heart rate,</p>
<p>it will not change with the exception of one thing,</p>
<p>which is age.</p>
<p>Age brings it down.</p>
<p>Training will not change it up in most circumstances.</p>
<p>If you look at something like an inflammatory response,</p>
<p>I suppose theoretically there is a ceiling,</p>
<p>though I&rsquo;m not aware of it.</p>
<p>I can tell you right now looking at blood markers</p>
<p>to things like creatine kinase.</p>
<p>So remember the conversation about metabolism</p>
<p>and that we use phosphocreatine</p>
<p>as one of our primary fuel sources for explosive exercise.</p>
<p>Well, if we&rsquo;re using phosphocreatine,</p>
<p>this creatine kinase,</p>
<p>now remember kinase are enzymes</p>
<p>that function to break things down for the most part.</p>
<p>So creatine kinase is the enzyme</p>
<p>you use to break down creatine.</p>
<p>When you do that a lot,</p>
<p>then that creatine kinase gets out of muscle</p>
<p>and seeps into the blood.</p>
<p>Myoglobin is actually another fantastic marker, by the way.</p>
<p>Myoglobin is, if you think about hemoglobin being in blood</p>
<p>as the molecule that carries oxygen around,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s in the muscle tissue,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s myoglobin, myo meaning muscle,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same globulin thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of markers</p>
<p>you can look at muscle breakdown.</p>
<p>And one of the things that you can see</p>
<p>is a creatine kinase level that&rsquo;s elevated</p>
<p>after say one bout of exercise,</p>
<p>and it might be up five or six fold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually seen this number</p>
<p>in offensive linemen in the NFL</p>
<p>be something like 500 plus fold.</p>
<p>So even within just one category to the next,</p>
<p>that number can get extraordinarily high.</p>
<p>This is actually one important point here.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re paying attention to any mechanistic research</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re using that to inform your decision-making,</p>
<p>you have to be extraordinarily careful of magnitude.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is</p>
<p>if I were to be running a Western blot</p>
<p>looking at a signaling protein in a muscle,</p>
<p>did this activation of this protein</p>
<p>turn on mitochondrial biogenesis?</p>
<p>And I saw that whatever intervention we gave it,</p>
<p>whether it was a nutrition thing</p>
<p>or a drug or an exercise,</p>
<p>and I saw that that signaling protein increased by 20%,</p>
<p>I would basically assume that</p>
<p>to be totally physiologically irrelevant.</p>
<p>Because in order for that to be important,</p>
<p>it totally depends on the marker you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>But some markers I might need to see</p>
<p>four or five, 600 fold increase</p>
<p>before I know that that will actually be enough</p>
<p>to be what we call physiologically relevant.</p>
<p>Others, if they&rsquo;re up one or 2%, that is relevant.</p>
<p>And so you really wanna be careful</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re either reading papers</p>
<p>or looking at social media stuff.</p>
<p>If people are just talking about</p>
<p>this marker increased this much, it may not matter.</p>
<p>It may be totally irrelevant physiologically.</p>
<p>And so you have to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also if you&rsquo;re wondering</p>
<p>how the hell are all these people,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s how they can trick you a little bit.</p>
<p>Intentionally or not.</p>
<p>It could be just they&rsquo;re trying to their best,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t really understand that area enough.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an important point to pay attention to.</p>
<p>So to answer your question again fully,</p>
<p>it would be hard to determine</p>
<p>if there is truly a maximum level.</p>
<p>Some things don&rsquo;t wanna move like blood pH.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really wanna move.</p>
<p>The range that you&rsquo;re gonna move from is like 6.8 to 7.4.</p>
<p>And if you get up to like 7.9,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re probably in big, big, big trouble.</p>
<p>Other things again can go up 500, 5,000 fold.</p>
<p>And so the markers will really determine that answer.</p>
<p>Well, at some point in the future,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to continue this discussion</p>
<p>around the topic of stress specifically.</p>
<p>And maybe we will get into that a little bit later today</p>
<p>when we get into the use of deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>because that certainly has effects</p>
<p>related directly to temperature on tissue,</p>
<p>but it certainly has mental effects</p>
<p>in terms of raising one&rsquo;s level of perceived pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Some people love it.</p>
<p>And some people love it</p>
<p>for the feeling they get during it.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>some people only like it</p>
<p>for the feeling that they get after it.</p>
<p>Not unlike exercise.</p>
<p>I love to train.</p>
<p>I love exercise,</p>
<p>but I know many people who they loathe exercise,</p>
<p>but they love the feeling afterward.</p>
<p>So this will be a theme that we will come back to.</p>
<p>Thank you for indulging my interest in that semi-tangent.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a relevant tangent if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>If you can now return us to the different timescales</p>
<p>and modes of recovery,</p>
<p>because I think where we are headed</p>
<p>is how to get better at recovery.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the tools.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what to measure and identify</p>
<p>for all four of these distinct levels.</p>
<p>So level one is what we call overload.</p>
<p>And just very quickly,</p>
<p>what that means is I did a workout today.</p>
<p>The sign and symptom of overload is you&rsquo;re fatigued.</p>
<p>Acute performance is down.</p>
<p>So I worked out hard right now.</p>
<p>If I were to go try to do a maximum effort,</p>
<p>I would be reduced in my ability.</p>
<p>The recovery period for acute overload is minutes to days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally what we call acute overload.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>So the system should theoretically</p>
<p>see that hormetic stressor,</p>
<p>come back in response,</p>
<p>come back bigger, better, more efficient, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you were to continue training in that state,</p>
<p>like most of us do,</p>
<p>and say I did a workout today,</p>
<p>I had a little bit of acute overload.</p>
<p>Gonna work out again tomorrow,</p>
<p>a little more acute overload.</p>
<p>Gonna work out the next day,</p>
<p>a little more acute overload.</p>
<p>Even if you took a day in between,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You just continue these acute bouts of insult.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re gonna be pushing into</p>
<p>the absolute golden target,</p>
<p>which is what we call functional overreaching.</p>
<p>So you have overreached what you can currently do,</p>
<p>and it results in a functional outcome.</p>
<p>And what we mean functionally here</p>
<p>is performance is enhanced.</p>
<p>And again, performance being whatever you deem it to be.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stronger, you&rsquo;ve enhanced muscle size,</p>
<p>your mitochondria has improved.</p>
<p>Whatever the thing is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a physical performance thing, right?</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Recovery time for functional overreaching</p>
<p>is typically a few days to maybe even a week or so.</p>
<p>And so typically what we see happen</p>
<p>is prior to a competition,</p>
<p>individuals will do what we call a taper,</p>
<p>which is a reduced training volume</p>
<p>for some short period of time.</p>
<p>And the reason they do that is to,</p>
<p>again, actualize, is the phrase we use here,</p>
<p>the adaptations.</p>
<p>And so you worked hard for six weeks,</p>
<p>and theoretically the workout you did</p>
<p>three, four, five, six weeks ago,</p>
<p>once you allow the system to recover,</p>
<p>will be actualized,</p>
<p>which means your performance will be enhanced here.</p>
<p>So functional overreaching is the golden target.</p>
<p>If you were to be at the point of functional overreaching</p>
<p>and you continue to train,</p>
<p>so it intensified,</p>
<p>whether this is through intensity,</p>
<p>this is through volume,</p>
<p>or really, as you said earlier,</p>
<p>you had something holding back your recovery.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Then you would move into what we call</p>
<p>non-functional overreaching.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve overreached again,</p>
<p>but now it is non-functional,</p>
<p>as in you did not see a positive benefit</p>
<p>once recovery allowed.</p>
<p>This typically means you have weeks.</p>
<p>It takes weeks to come back from,</p>
<p>and you basically just get back to baseline.</p>
<p>And this is where a lot of folks are</p>
<p>who end up in this vicious cycle.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>man, I&rsquo;m not getting the results I want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to train harder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting results I want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna train harder and harder.</p>
<p>But because recovery isn&rsquo;t improved,</p>
<p>you just end up in the same spot,</p>
<p>so then you train more,</p>
<p>and you end up in the same spot,</p>
<p>and you end up then just either blowing up or quitting,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting where you want.</p>
<p>If you were to continue past that point,</p>
<p>you may actually be into what we actually call overtraining.</p>
<p>And that typically is considered to be overtrained</p>
<p>if it takes months to recover from.</p>
<p>So most people think they&rsquo;re overtrained</p>
<p>and are really not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just probably non-functionally overreached.</p>
<p>And again, the classic distinction is</p>
<p>if you took three or four days off and you felt better,</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t probably quote-unquote overtrained.</p>
<p>You were probably just in this area</p>
<p>of non-functional reaching.</p>
<p>You need a little bit of a back off.</p>
<p>If you, and this has been the case,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this happen with gymnasts and a cheerleader</p>
<p>and some other things where they take a month off</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re barely seeing them start</p>
<p>to come back to their baseline numbers</p>
<p>in any number of areas, mood, desire to train,</p>
<p>testosterone, cortisol ratios,</p>
<p>bowel markers in a number of areas,</p>
<p>physical performance, vertical jump height,</p>
<p>like all these things.</p>
<p>They just start to get back to baseline.</p>
<p>So true overtraining is actually quite rare.</p>
<p>Non-functional overreaching is much more common</p>
<p>and it is a shorter timeframe scale.</p>
<p>So when we talk about recovery,</p>
<p>those are the four pieces that we&rsquo;re really thinking about.</p>
<p>And so if you are concerned about, oh, I&rsquo;m super sore,</p>
<p>how do I get less sore?</p>
<p>How do I either not be a sore</p>
<p>next time I do that same workout,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m super sore and now how do I recover?</p>
<p>Those are playing in that first category of overload.</p>
<p>And we can certainly talk about how to figure that out,</p>
<p>but the quick answer is you gotta go back</p>
<p>to our previous episodes and just pay attention</p>
<p>to the volume intensity recommendations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re getting significantly more damage</p>
<p>or fatigue in a workout,</p>
<p>you probably have increased your volume too quickly</p>
<p>or something else is dragging your stress bucket down.</p>
<p>But generally, this is a problem of training.</p>
<p>You either didn&rsquo;t warm up sufficiently,</p>
<p>your fueling strategy is off,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about in the next episode,</p>
<p>or you violated one of our principles</p>
<p>of increasing intensity and volume sort of too quickly.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s past that and you&rsquo;re getting to a stage</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just like, I&rsquo;m feeling beat up all the time,</p>
<p>my energy is going down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not feeling like I&rsquo;m recovered,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re in this overreaching stage.</p>
<p>So the story I kind of tell here always</p>
<p>is a few years ago I was working</p>
<p>and my wife Natasha was in the garage training</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing something and she comes stumbling</p>
<p>and she has this look on her eyes</p>
<p>and her eyeballs are giant and she&rsquo;s just wobbling.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I effed up.</p>
<p>And I was like, what do you mean you effed up?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s just like, I read the program wrong.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p>Like she was supposed to be doing 10 sets of three</p>
<p>every minute on the minute.</p>
<p>And she did three sets of 10 every minute on the minute.</p>
<p>And she was absolutely wrecked.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t move for a few hours afterwards.</p>
<p>And then for days she&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>you have to handle the kids,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t get out of bed, I can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>So that was like a classic example of,</p>
<p>all right, like we don&rsquo;t need to fix recovery here,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a dummy and you did the training way too hard,</p>
<p>too long, like this is not, we don&rsquo;t have a problem here.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a situation like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s generally you just, the program was way off.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s constantly happening where you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>man, like for whatever reason,</p>
<p>every once in a while I&rsquo;m getting really sore</p>
<p>or having a really bad performance in these workouts,</p>
<p>then we need to go to our other stress bucket,</p>
<p>take a look at our allostatic load or allostasis</p>
<p>and get figured out what&rsquo;s happening there.</p>
<p>So those are the easy ways to flag acute overload problems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy that you pointed out the distinction</p>
<p>between functional overreaching,</p>
<p>overtraining and being overtrained.</p>
<p>I think one common mistake that people make</p>
<p>in thinking about biology generally,</p>
<p>is that they think in terms of nouns and adjectives</p>
<p>and not verbs.</p>
<p>Amazing, I love that so much.</p>
<p>Biology is a collection of processes or processes,</p>
<p>depending on who you are and where you live</p>
<p>and who you trained with.</p>
<p>Being overtrained is a state that in many ways</p>
<p>is an adjective.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re overtrained, I&rsquo;m overtrained.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, I&rsquo;m an American,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Czechoslovakian, whatever it happens to be.</p>
<p>And in many ways, people do start to associate</p>
<p>with an identity, at least a transient identity.</p>
<p>And they start making all sorts of decisions,</p>
<p>it sounds like, about what sorts of verbs</p>
<p>they will and will not engage in.</p>
<p>Whereas I think if we look at things as processes</p>
<p>and we assign verbs to them, then we can say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m functionally overreaching</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m truly overtraining,</p>
<p>which is just a matter of degrees, right?</p>
<p>Or undertraining for that matter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reaching, but I&rsquo;m not functionally reaching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just performance.</p>
<p>And just as with the nervous system,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t change unless you give it a reason to.</p>
<p>This is the reason why if you can perform something</p>
<p>perfectly or speak a language perfectly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no rewiring of the nervous system.</p>
<p>This myth that we&rsquo;ve all been told</p>
<p>that every experience rewires your nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different now than it was two seconds ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a ridiculous, illogical statement.</p>
<p>We know that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>If your nervous system can perform something,</p>
<p>it has no reason to change and it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Muscles the same way.</p>
<p>This is why you have to progressively overload.</p>
<p>You have to learn something new</p>
<p>or challenge your muscle to do something new.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s same thing.</p>
<p>So in the example that you gave</p>
<p>with your wife doing this workout</p>
<p>that turned out to be far more strenuous,</p>
<p>she had functionally overreach.</p>
<p>In some sense, she might&rsquo;ve been overtraining</p>
<p>or heading in the direction of overtraining,</p>
<p>but the mistake would be to assume</p>
<p>that she was overtrained, right?</p>
<p>It almost becomes a bit of a state</p>
<p>or a character assignment as opposed to a verb.</p>
<p>And in any case, there&rsquo;s no perfect way to describe it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about nouns and adjectives</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re also talking about verbs,</p>
<p>but I think the verbs are really anchored down</p>
<p>in processes and things that we do,</p>
<p>actions that we can take.</p>
<p>And so if I may, I&rsquo;d like to just highlight this idea</p>
<p>of shifting one&rsquo;s thinking towards verb actions</p>
<p>rather than labels on the state that we happen to be in</p>
<p>or the person that we happen to be, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes it even does become kind of characterological</p>
<p>in the way that people describe it.</p>
<p>And so I have to believe</p>
<p>that there is something called overtraining,</p>
<p>that overtraining is real in other words,</p>
<p>but that we don&rsquo;t ever really know if we&rsquo;re overtrained.</p>
<p>You nailed it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, you know, it&rsquo;s not like a red flag,</p>
<p>you know, shoots up out of your shoulder</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m overtrained.</p>
<p>So in doing so, I hope that we can start thinking</p>
<p>about some of the verbs, the actions that we can all take</p>
<p>in order to ensure that we stimulate progressive overload</p>
<p>one way or another.</p>
<p>And at the same time that we don&rsquo;t fall</p>
<p>into these bins of character assignment</p>
<p>where suddenly we decide that we need to do X,</p>
<p>like take a month off or something like that.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m beginning to realize from our discussion</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s exactly the wrong way to go.</p>
<p>Those are fantastic points.</p>
<p>I wanna make sure it is clear</p>
<p>that there is no clinical diagnoses for overtraining.</p>
<p>There are no standards,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no test or a blood panel you can pull</p>
<p>that would actually identify you in that state.</p>
<p>So your distinction here, Andrew,</p>
<p>of these are verbs rather than nouns is so wonderful</p>
<p>because that is exactly the case.</p>
<p>The only way we could really come retroactively diagnose one</p>
<p>with overtraining is if, again,</p>
<p>we had you did weeks of recovery</p>
<p>and you only got back to baseline.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do it in the moment.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take a single test.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no subjective marker</p>
<p>or anything that says you are overtrained.</p>
<p>It is simply you are probably overtraining</p>
<p>and we need to reverse that quickly.</p>
<p>Or in the case of the step before,</p>
<p>you are probably non-functionally overreaching.</p>
<p>And if you continue to do this,</p>
<p>you will probably enter into a stage</p>
<p>where this is you&rsquo;re overtraining and we need to come back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important thing to let people know</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s no one thing we can actually point to</p>
<p>that says you are here, you are not a noun, this is a verb.</p>
<p>So what are some tools that we can use</p>
<p>to enhance our recovery?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s start off with that acute overload phase.</p>
<p>So in other words, I just did a workout</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m feeling awful, or I just did one two days ago</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m super sore.</p>
<p>How do I get rid of that right now?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a couple of things you can do immediately</p>
<p>after your workout.</p>
<p>And then others that are maybe more actionable</p>
<p>a day later or two days later.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll just cover a handful of them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do some nutrition and hydration and supplementation</p>
<p>in the next episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna cover everything else</p>
<p>not in that category right now.</p>
<p>So a couple of things, number one,</p>
<p>you can actually kickstart that recovery process</p>
<p>at the end of your current training session.</p>
<p>And I guess I should say this way,</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you start this recovery process</p>
<p>immediately after the workout.</p>
<p>You mentioned earlier about this idea of</p>
<p>you gotta get a really high peak of stress</p>
<p>to cause adaptation.</p>
<p>But I actually didn&rsquo;t explain that correctly</p>
<p>because what has to happen is</p>
<p>you need that extremely high peak,</p>
<p>but then you have to be met</p>
<p>with an extremely sharp recovery back down.</p>
<p>And so, you&rsquo;ve talked about this before</p>
<p>in some of your neuroplasticity stuff</p>
<p>and in terms of what has to happen that caused the insult</p>
<p>and then you immediately need to be able to recover</p>
<p>to make sure that that causes changes in the brain.</p>
<p>Same thing happens here.</p>
<p>So we need a really sharp and high inflammatory response.</p>
<p>And then if you do not meet it</p>
<p>with an immediate recovery period,</p>
<p>the signal won&rsquo;t be there to maximize your results.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>You can actually do a couple of things.</p>
<p>Number one is actually listening to slow paced music.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s evidence to suggest fast paced music</p>
<p>may slow down your recovery</p>
<p>and slow paced would actually enhance it.</p>
<p>So if you just change from your maximum,</p>
<p>get you up and get going music during the workout</p>
<p>to a slower, lower cadence,</p>
<p>that will help you kickstart the idea.</p>
<p>Of a similar note,</p>
<p>you can also use what we call down regulation breathing.</p>
<p>You could do them in conjunction or one or the other,</p>
<p>whichever is up to you.</p>
<p>So my personal favorite method here</p>
<p>is somewhere between three to 10 minutes</p>
<p>of finishing your training session,</p>
<p>laying down, I like to be in that position.</p>
<p>You could certainly do it in the lotus position,</p>
<p>but I think laying on your back is generally more effective.</p>
<p>Personal preference there, no science.</p>
<p>I like the eyes being covered,</p>
<p>getting into this dark, quiet sort of area.</p>
<p>And then just breathing through your nose</p>
<p>in a structured cadence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different things you can try.</p>
<p>An easy example is just box breathing.</p>
<p>So you can imagine box having four squares.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re going to do is inhale</p>
<p>for somewhere between like three to eight seconds.</p>
<p>And then whatever number you choose,</p>
<p>you keep that same tempo.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s say you chose to do a five second inhale.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna take you up vertically.</p>
<p>And then horizontally for your box is a five second hold.</p>
<p>And then a five second exhale.</p>
<p>And then a five second hold.</p>
<p>And you just need to repeat that for the time domain.</p>
<p>I typically honestly don&rsquo;t use a timer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll actually notice a lot of people will fall asleep</p>
<p>or get really close to falling asleep in this period.</p>
<p>You could do a triangle version of that</p>
<p>where you do an inhale, hold, exhale,</p>
<p>and then go right back into your inhale.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a bunch of different tricks you can try here.</p>
<p>You need to play around</p>
<p>and see what actually works best for you.</p>
<p>10 minutes is probably better,</p>
<p>but if you can just at least give me three, that&rsquo;ll work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really, really resistant,</p>
<p>you can actually do that just in the shower.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re gonna finish your workout,</p>
<p>get in the shower.</p>
<p>Again, just close your eyes in the shower.</p>
<p>Give me three minutes of focused relaxation breathing.</p>
<p>And that will accelerate the recovery process.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I particularly love it</p>
<p>because my laboratory works on stress and respiration,</p>
<p>aka breathing, and the interactions between the two.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just mention a result</p>
<p>that was just accepted for publication,</p>
<p>so should be out by the time this episode airs.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>This is the beautiful work of, not me directly,</p>
<p>although it took place in my lab,</p>
<p>but as we know, it&rsquo;s the students at Postdocs</p>
<p>who really do the heavy lifting,</p>
<p>of Dr. Melisse Balbon in my lab.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a phenomenal researcher</p>
<p>that showed that a short period</p>
<p>of five minutes of box breathing,</p>
<p>of exactly the type that you described,</p>
<p>or cyclic sighing,</p>
<p>so two inhales followed by an extended exhale</p>
<p>to lungs empty.</p>
<p>Ideally, the inhales are done through the nose.</p>
<p>The exhales are done through the mouth,</p>
<p>although it could all be done through the nose</p>
<p>or the mouth for that matter,</p>
<p>but probably nose, nose for inhale,</p>
<p>inhale, mouth for exhale,</p>
<p>or inhales through the nose and exhale through the nose.</p>
<p>Cyclic sighing, as we refer to it,</p>
<p>done for five minutes.</p>
<p>Both of those produce very significant decreases</p>
<p>in resting heart rate.</p>
<p>They, over time, will increase things</p>
<p>like heart rate variability and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So provided that there are extended exhales,</p>
<p>it seems like the calming response</p>
<p>and the reduction in overall stress occurs.</p>
<p>The only thing that really sends things</p>
<p>in the other direction would be something</p>
<p>like cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve observed that.</p>
<p>And interestingly,</p>
<p>when we had people just do five minutes of meditation,</p>
<p>during which, of course, they are breathing,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just allowing their breathing to progress,</p>
<p>however it happens to be in that moment</p>
<p>or moments across the five minutes,</p>
<p>there were reductions in the same sorts</p>
<p>of markers of stress that I described,</p>
<p>but not as significant as breathing.</p>
<p>So I love the Brock&rsquo;s Breathing Tool post-workout,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some other alternatives there, too,</p>
<p>that I just mentioned.</p>
<p>But I think people greatly underestimate</p>
<p>the potency of breathing</p>
<p>for shifting one&rsquo;s nervous system function</p>
<p>away from stress or, if one wants,</p>
<p>toward more alertness and stress.</p>
<p>I actually have a couple questions for you on that.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I think the audience would appreciate this.</p>
<p>How long were those boxes?</p>
<p>Was it just user-selected?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>So we used the carbon dioxide tolerance test-</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>In order for people to determine</p>
<p>how long the different sides of the box should be.</p>
<p>And you covered carbon dioxide tolerance tests</p>
<p>in a previous episode.</p>
<p>Now, we can provide a link to that clip</p>
<p>in the show note captions,</p>
<p>but as you point out,</p>
<p>it involves a long extended exhale to lungs empty.</p>
<p>And of course, people could sit with lungs empty,</p>
<p>but they have to accurately, faithfully, as we say,</p>
<p>report how long it took them to empty their lungs.</p>
<p>We use that as a gauge.</p>
<p>Typically, if it takes,</p>
<p>if people go to lungs empty in 20 seconds or less,</p>
<p>I believe, I have to go back to the paper and look,</p>
<p>but I believe that the duration</p>
<p>for each of the sides of the boxes, as it were,</p>
<p>was somewhere between two and three seconds.</p>
<p>If they had a CO2 discard time</p>
<p>of anywhere from 20 seconds up to about 40, 45 seconds,</p>
<p>we used the sides of the box</p>
<p>were, I believe, between four and six seconds.</p>
<p>And then for people longer than who could discard their air</p>
<p>over a period of a minute or more,</p>
<p>we used a box duration that is inhale-hold,</p>
<p>exhale-hold duration of somewhere between,</p>
<p>I believe it was seven or maybe it was eight</p>
<p>and as long as 11 or 12 seconds.</p>
<p>You get your kind of free diver types</p>
<p>who can really do this,</p>
<p>who are really well-trained for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t quote me exactly on those numbers,</p>
<p>but that was approximate.</p>
<p>Those line up exactly with what we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So I believe it&rsquo;s going to be close.</p>
<p>Within seconds of non-important distinction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be close enough.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And that was, it took them what, six weeks?</p>
<p>So this study was done over the period of a month</p>
<p>and then when they were swapped</p>
<p>into a new pattern of breathing condition</p>
<p>or meditation condition.</p>
<p>And this was all done in the natural world, as we say.</p>
<p>They were wearing boot bands,</p>
<p>they were getting heart rate, heart rate variability,</p>
<p>sleep data, subjective data about mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there were a lot of measures,</p>
<p>but this was more than a hundred subjects</p>
<p>out in the wild of life.</p>
<p>And we tried as best we could to track life stress events</p>
<p>and exercise and things like that.</p>
<p>That was harder to control outside the laboratory.</p>
<p>Really all those results speak to exactly</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re describing here,</p>
<p>which is that deliberate respiration</p>
<p>that involves controlled holds and exhales</p>
<p>really has a dramatic and very immediate impact</p>
<p>on reducing our levels of stress.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised at all with your findings.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting about that is</p>
<p>you mentioned how the exhalation portion</p>
<p>is primarily responsible for the down regulation.</p>
<p>That actually goes back</p>
<p>to our previous endurance conversation,</p>
<p>which is that in general, at rest, at non-altitude,</p>
<p>increases in CO2 are the primary driver for ventilation.</p>
<p>And so what that generally means is</p>
<p>inhales are associated with an uptick in sympathetic state</p>
<p>and exhales are associated</p>
<p>with a uptick of parasympathetic state.</p>
<p>This is generally why folks will do things like exhale</p>
<p>and finish that exhale</p>
<p>right before they perform</p>
<p>a very high precision neurological task.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to, say, aim at a target and shoot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to exhale fully</p>
<p>and then almost always execute that movement</p>
<p>at the end of the exhale</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re in your highest</p>
<p>parasympathetic state and lowest drive for ventilation.</p>
<p>I have to say, I&rsquo;m not surprised at all</p>
<p>that you guys found that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually other data that point to individuals,</p>
<p>particularly after endurance training,</p>
<p>that can get back down to baseline heart rate</p>
<p>is going to be correlated</p>
<p>with who gets the most actual result of their training.</p>
<p>Said that, if you take a bunch of individuals</p>
<p>and put them through an endurance training program,</p>
<p>if you measure how quickly they can get back down</p>
<p>to baseline after each workout,</p>
<p>in general, those folks that are better at that</p>
<p>are going to see greater improvements in performance</p>
<p>at the end of your, say,</p>
<p>four or six or eight week training block.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a little bit of causation</p>
<p>and correlation there that we have to untie,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s enough to say,</p>
<p>hey, if you invest these three,</p>
<p>and in your case, your study was five minutes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only going to enhance recovery.</p>
<p>You have a likelihood of increasing your results</p>
<p>from your training.</p>
<p>And now we also have additional benefits</p>
<p>like being able to transition more appropriately</p>
<p>into our next task, going to work,</p>
<p>going to see family, whatever the thing is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a nice close to,</p>
<p>I asked you to be in a high sympathetic state body,</p>
<p>and I asked you to perform and to be under stress,</p>
<p>I gave you recovery,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re ready to transition into our next thing</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t take that exercise energy, if you will,</p>
<p>into our next task,</p>
<p>which may or may not want me in a sympathetic drive state.</p>
<p>So if somebody is sore following a workout,</p>
<p>either locally sore in a muscle group or group of muscles,</p>
<p>maybe in their legs or chest or torso,</p>
<p>or maybe their whole body is sore,</p>
<p>as it sometimes is the case,</p>
<p>what are some tools that they can implement</p>
<p>in order to accelerate the,</p>
<p>I want to call it moving out of that soreness,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really, as we know,</p>
<p>the alleviation of the soreness</p>
<p>through a bunch of different processes.</p>
<p>What are the most effective tools</p>
<p>to push back on that soreness and dissipate it?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s not lactate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a really important thing</p>
<p>that we still hear people talk about is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sore 24 hours later,</p>
<p>you got to do this thing to get the lactate out of there.</p>
<p>As we talked about in the metabolism conversation</p>
<p>in an episode, that is not the cause of fatigue,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly not the cause of soreness.</p>
<p>So not an actionable tip there,</p>
<p>but just a pet peeve of mine</p>
<p>when I hear people say that, that I get irritated.</p>
<p>So we can maybe end that conversation.</p>
<p>Strategies, tools, here&rsquo;s what you can do.</p>
<p>You can actually wear compression gear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a decent amount of evidence</p>
<p>suggesting if you just were to put</p>
<p>some tighter fitting clothes on,</p>
<p>leisure wear or compression gear if you have it,</p>
<p>that that can actually prevent</p>
<p>a little bit of soreness from occurring.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in the case of poor Natasha</p>
<p>and you realize you&rsquo;ve just done way, way, way too much,</p>
<p>or you went and hung out with your bow hunting friend</p>
<p>and you trained way too hard</p>
<p>and you realize, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be very sore here,</p>
<p>you can immediately put on compression gear</p>
<p>and wear that really for as long as possible.</p>
<p>What are some examples of compression gear?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people on the plane with those high socks.</p>
<p>I mean, anything that you wear compression gear</p>
<p>for what you do for exercise.</p>
<p>So whether these are just compression pants and leggings,</p>
<p>tight fitting leggings,</p>
<p>whether this is a long sleeve shirt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a rash guard you would wear in jujitsu</p>
<p>or surfing or something like that.</p>
<p>As long as it&rsquo;s tight fitting,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be much more than that.</p>
<p>You can wear, I suppose you could get the socks,</p>
<p>would be great, but we generally just tell our athletes</p>
<p>they would put on a long sleeve compression shirts</p>
<p>that they would wear for their training</p>
<p>and then long compression leggings and that&rsquo;d be fine.</p>
<p>Can people apply these compression garb after training</p>
<p>and still get some of the positive effects?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have not seen any evidence to suggest</p>
<p>that that would block adaptation.</p>
<p>That may be the case.</p>
<p>I am not aware of those studies if that happens,</p>
<p>but I certainly know that the information suggests</p>
<p>it can enhance a little bit of muscle recovery.</p>
<p>But ideally one knows if they are about to do a workout</p>
<p>that could trigger a lot of soreness</p>
<p>and then wears compression gear of some sort to offset that.</p>
<p>And if so, does it have to be local to the muscle groups</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on?</p>
<p>The reason I asked about the socks</p>
<p>is my understanding of the compression socks</p>
<p>people wear on the plane is that it&rsquo;s going to shift</p>
<p>the patterns of blood flow, not just in the lower legs,</p>
<p>but all over the body.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re probably going to want to focus it</p>
<p>on the actual exercising tissue,</p>
<p>though actually that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer of whether or not</p>
<p>you did an upper body workout,</p>
<p>only wore lower body compression gear</p>
<p>if that would actually help.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>It may have been done, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>In general, we just tell people like wear the whole thing</p>
<p>as much as you can.</p>
<p>I actually am not concerned that you&rsquo;re wearing it</p>
<p>during your workout.</p>
<p>It is something you could put on afterwards</p>
<p>or even wear just a little bit of compression the other day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually did a really fun study.</p>
<p>I collaborated with Bill Kramer,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s Sport Scientist of the Year Award</p>
<p>is the Bill Kramer Award,</p>
<p>if that gives you any indication</p>
<p>out of University of Connecticut,</p>
<p>as well as with Lee Brown.</p>
<p>So two Lifetime Achievement Award winners.</p>
<p>And we put people on a plane in Storrs, Connecticut</p>
<p>and flew them to Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>So a cross country flight.</p>
<p>And some of them got to wear compression gear</p>
<p>during the flight and others did not.</p>
<p>And then they landed in California, did a training bout,</p>
<p>put them back on the plane, went back to Storrs.</p>
<p>And I think they did another training bout</p>
<p>when they got back there.</p>
<p>There was a lot of data that came out of that paper.</p>
<p>But one of the things that was clear</p>
<p>is the compression group was effective</p>
<p>at handling some of the blood related coagulation</p>
<p>and other issues associated with long flights</p>
<p>and particularly athletic performance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually a sneaky little insider trick</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll use a lot with people,</p>
<p>particularly with athletes that are traveling,</p>
<p>is just wear that compression gear on the plane.</p>
<p>So you talked about that</p>
<p>and that sort of brung that study to mind</p>
<p>that as another effective strategy.</p>
<p>So compression gear in general,</p>
<p>as well as particularly on a plane,</p>
<p>basically the tighter you can get it the better</p>
<p>without obviously making your hands purple</p>
<p>and being uncomfortable and things like that.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have to be overly tight.</p>
<p>Anything will work and probably help.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m also doing that personally</p>
<p>anytime I&rsquo;m taking a flight like that, as much as I can,</p>
<p>just to feel a little better when I get there.</p>
<p>So what are some other methods</p>
<p>that we can use to alleviate acute soreness?</p>
<p>Well, if we continue down the same theme,</p>
<p>which is saying, okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll use some sort of pressure manipulation</p>
<p>to enhance recovery.</p>
<p>If compression is one strategy,</p>
<p>you can also use things like compression boots or garments.</p>
<p>And these are nomadic devices that will pump air</p>
<p>outside you and compress back and forth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s any number of devices that will do this.</p>
<p>You can also use the physical hand.</p>
<p>So this would be massage and body work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all really working as best we can tell</p>
<p>on the same mechanisms,</p>
<p>which are effectively moving fluid in and out of the tissue,</p>
<p>as well as potentially enhancing blood flow,</p>
<p>increasing capillarization,</p>
<p>and which is going to only get nutrients in</p>
<p>and waste products out.</p>
<p>So you can kind of pick and choose based upon your budget,</p>
<p>preferences, availability, timing, things like that.</p>
<p>So those are all effective strategies.</p>
<p>Outside of that really is the next largest category.</p>
<p>Which is now thermal.</p>
<p>And so far in this discussion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve mentioned cold water immersion.</p>
<p>And I talked about in the hypertrophy section</p>
<p>how you would not want to do that immediately post exercise,</p>
<p>which would be getting into cold water or an ice bath,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to grow muscle mass.</p>
<p>Having said that, there is good evidence</p>
<p>showing that cold water immersion specifically</p>
<p>is effective at reducing muscle soreness.</p>
<p>So it is a fair consideration.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a classic example</p>
<p>of how there are no free passes in physiology.</p>
<p>Nothing is always good or always bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always about what are you willing to give up</p>
<p>versus what you&rsquo;re willing to get.</p>
<p>And in the case of cold water immersion,</p>
<p>you may be thinking,</p>
<p>yeah, I might want some of the hypertrophic adaptations.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in that phase of training</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually trying to push more</p>
<p>towards optimization in that moment,</p>
<p>rather than long-term adaptation,</p>
<p>then an ice bath might be a great choice.</p>
<p>In addition, if you fall into a scenario</p>
<p>like Natasha did,</p>
<p>and you realize like, I&rsquo;m just so unbelievably sore,</p>
<p>this might cost me three or four or five</p>
<p>or six days of training,</p>
<p>it might be worth it for you to accelerate</p>
<p>that recovery process by a couple of days</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t miss so much training.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a, it&rsquo;s an algorithm, it&rsquo;s an equation.</p>
<p>What am I looking for?</p>
<p>Again, if I&rsquo;m in season or trying to compete,</p>
<p>or if I have just done way, way, way too much exercise</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really in significant pain,</p>
<p>you would probably be willing to give up</p>
<p>some small percentage of eventual muscle growth</p>
<p>after a single session to get out of pain.</p>
<p>So of the cold strategies,</p>
<p>cold water immersion is clearly the best approach</p>
<p>rather than cold air or some other tactics.</p>
<p>So a cold shower is probably not enough here.</p>
<p>You really do wanna be either in moderately cold,</p>
<p>this is maybe 40 to 50 degree water</p>
<p>for probably north of 15 minutes,</p>
<p>or you can be in sub 40 for as little as maybe five minutes</p>
<p>to get some of the factor.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been a number of studies,</p>
<p>some sort of summarizing a bunch of that</p>
<p>kind of into one rather than going through them</p>
<p>point by point.</p>
<p>The numbers you just threw out,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m assuming are Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>seem really cold to me, right?</p>
<p>Uncomfortably cold.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I always recommend that people ease into it</p>
<p>as a protocol overall,</p>
<p>that they not immediately go to 35 degree cold water</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve never done it before.</p>
<p>That said, once people are comfortable being uncomfortable,</p>
<p>because I always answer the question,</p>
<p>how cold should it be exactly?</p>
<p>Would you agree that it should be very, very cold,</p>
<p>so much so that you really, really want to get out,</p>
<p>but that you&rsquo;re able to stay in safely,</p>
<p>whatever that value happens to be?</p>
<p>You absolutely need to be safe.</p>
<p>Having said that, we have actually in our XPT retreats</p>
<p>put dozens, if not hundreds of people at this point,</p>
<p>immediately into the sub 35 degree water</p>
<p>their first time ever and done three minutes,</p>
<p>multiple rounds in a session, so they can handle it.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t need to go that crazy if you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>You kind of have to play a game, right?</p>
<p>Do you want to be really, really cold</p>
<p>for a short amount of time?</p>
<p>Or do you want to be kind of cold</p>
<p>for a longer amount of time?</p>
<p>Really, the only mistake you could make</p>
<p>is doing something like 65 degree water,</p>
<p>which for most people is not very comfortable,</p>
<p>and doing five or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not going to be effective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not going to be effective.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like, man, 35 is absolutely crazy,</p>
<p>and you want to do 55 degree water,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s literature in that area,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going to say you need to probably be there</p>
<p>somewhere almost surely north of 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And some of it will actually show you need to be in there</p>
<p>like well north of 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So for my money, I would rather go really, really cold</p>
<p>and get it done in five minutes,</p>
<p>but personal preference on this one.</p>
<p>You can also make it a little bit easier on yourself.</p>
<p>There is not nearly as much evidence,</p>
<p>but there is some on contrast stuff.</p>
<p>So this is when you go cold, hot, and sort of back and forth.</p>
<p>There are no really good rules</p>
<p>in terms of how much should you go, how many rounds,</p>
<p>how long in cold, how long in hot.</p>
<p>Again, there have been a couple of studies,</p>
<p>but obviously those studies use numbers,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean those have been tested</p>
<p>to see what are optimal, which is a very big difference.</p>
<p>So you can really just kind of play that by feel.</p>
<p>Hot is good for recovery.</p>
<p>You just have to be careful</p>
<p>because you are going to put more blood flow in the area,</p>
<p>and so you may walk out of there</p>
<p>with some additional acute swelling,</p>
<p>which is then going to put greater pressure on there.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of play with that.</p>
<p>I personally really like hot for recovery.</p>
<p>I will feel maybe not great in that moment,</p>
<p>but the next day I tend to feel really, really good.</p>
<p>In addition, if I wake up the next morning</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really, really hurting and I&rsquo;m super stiff,</p>
<p>a hot bath will help that quite a bit.</p>
<p>So you can play with some of those protocols.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t have to do ice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no requirement to do so.</p>
<p>It is just an option if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<p>The studies of Dr. Susanna Soberg</p>
<p>are not directly aimed at alleviating soreness or recovery.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more about increasing thermal capacity</p>
<p>by a storage of brown adipose tissue,</p>
<p>not the blubbery fat,</p>
<p>but the stuff around the clavicles and around the heart</p>
<p>that help you generate body heat at rest</p>
<p>and metabolism and so on.</p>
<p>And the numbers there that she&rsquo;s come up with,</p>
<p>again, have not been tested</p>
<p>against all the possible derivations.</p>
<p>Just like with breathing, we did five minute sessions,</p>
<p>but who knows, maybe a minute</p>
<p>would have been equally effective.</p>
<p>We just, there are constraints on these sorts of studies.</p>
<p>But the values that she&rsquo;s come up with,</p>
<p>which seem to be good thresholds</p>
<p>for making sure that an adaptation response</p>
<p>is triggered by heat and cold,</p>
<p>is it ends up being 57 minutes per week total</p>
<p>of uncomfortable but safe heat.</p>
<p>In that case, sauna,</p>
<p>and that can be all in one session</p>
<p>or breaking it up into a couple of sessions</p>
<p>on the same day or different days.</p>
<p>And then 11 minutes per week of cold,</p>
<p>either in one single session or multiple sessions.</p>
<p>Again, one could do more.</p>
<p>One could break that up over multiple days</p>
<p>or do it all in one day or do it all in one,</p>
<p>you know, an hour in the sauna</p>
<p>and then 11 minutes in the cold or vice versa,</p>
<p>although that seems a little bit extreme,</p>
<p>especially for the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But those are the numbers that have been studied.</p>
<p>But as you point out,</p>
<p>there are not a lot of really thorough studies</p>
<p>examining different cold protocols</p>
<p>according to temperature by time requirements.</p>
<p>So there is a bit of subjective feel</p>
<p>required to establish a routine.</p>
<p>And I would actually say this is another time</p>
<p>to reemphasize something we talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning of our conversation,</p>
<p>which is that pain itself is not a defined outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavily influenced by your perception.</p>
<p>And so if you don&rsquo;t feel like they work for you,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>If you feel like they work fantastic, they do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a challenging field</p>
<p>to get really objective data on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always going to be a little bit</p>
<p>of subjective nature to some of these things.</p>
<p>I can tell you anecdotally,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve used hot and cold contrasts</p>
<p>for a long time with athletes.</p>
<p>Some love it, some don&rsquo;t care for it</p>
<p>and everything in between.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of those things where I never mandated.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I can&rsquo;t mandate anything</p>
<p>for anyone I work with, but I&rsquo;m never, you know,</p>
<p>hey, are you interested?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Are you struggling in this area?</p>
<p>Do you want to try this?</p>
<p>You did and you liked it, great.</p>
<p>Are you struggling in this area and you tried it,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t love it?</p>
<p>Okay, fine, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find other routes as we will get into.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to enhance recovery.</p>
<p>This is only one and it hasn&rsquo;t even really come down</p>
<p>to stopping the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just treating symptoms,</p>
<p>which is first line of defense,</p>
<p>but you really need to go back</p>
<p>and figure out why it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>to begin with as a solution.</p>
<p>These are just different,</p>
<p>again, acute symptom management tactics.</p>
<p>One final point about deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>I think worth mentioning is one of the reasons</p>
<p>the shower is effective, but not nearly as effective</p>
<p>as cold water immersion or immersion in ice up to the neck</p>
<p>is simply because of the reason you stated before,</p>
<p>which is that most showers are not going to get that cold.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get down, you know, into the sub 40s.</p>
<p>Also, cold showers haven&rsquo;t really been studied that much.</p>
<p>They have, but not nearly as much as immersion.</p>
<p>And people always ask why.</p>
<p>I just think about the challenges</p>
<p>of studying cold water exposure in the shower</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t really control</p>
<p>for how much of the body is covered,</p>
<p>whether or not the head stays</p>
<p>under different sized bodies, et cetera.</p>
<p>Whereas when people come into a laboratory,</p>
<p>they can get into a cold water tank.</p>
<p>We know where the neck is, we know where the chin is,</p>
<p>and we can make sure that people&rsquo;s arms</p>
<p>and legs are underneath.</p>
<p>But with cold shower, sure you can make everyone face away</p>
<p>or toward the shower, but it&rsquo;s really tricky.</p>
<p>And for all the variations that were described,</p>
<p>that said, would you agree that if one wants</p>
<p>to use deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>that cold shower is better than nothing</p>
<p>and cold immersion in circulating cold water</p>
<p>or ice bath is better than cold shower?</p>
<p>Yeah, what I would actually say,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking for recovery for muscle soreness,</p>
<p>I would say cold shower is probably doing very little</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to be able</p>
<p>to get enough cold water onto any muscle</p>
<p>besides basically your head.</p>
<p>So maybe you could try a cold bath</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;d at least get some surface area coverage.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you wanna use cold shower</p>
<p>for all the other awesome reasons,</p>
<p>the cold shower, that&rsquo;s totally great.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re trying to use that</p>
<p>to recover your low back and glutes</p>
<p>from being sore from training in a good way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not gonna do much.</p>
<p>The immersion won&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>You actually also hit a sneaky other point,</p>
<p>which is if you can&rsquo;t get your water super cold,</p>
<p>just make the water move.</p>
<p>So if you have jets and stuff you can turn on</p>
<p>and anyone who&rsquo;s tried this and if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, I can do a 40 degree bath, awesome.</p>
<p>Try 60 when the water&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>Right, because you break up the thermal layer.</p>
<p>Normally you have a little thin layer of water</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re heating up.</p>
<p>You break that up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole new world.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So being very still in the cold water</p>
<p>is actually the weaker way to go.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That you can make your face stoic,</p>
<p>but make your body circulate some water around you.</p>
<p>As long as we&rsquo;re on this,</p>
<p>maybe just one more point about heat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly used sauna, wet sauna, dry sauna,</p>
<p>steam saunas, excuse me.</p>
<p>Jacuzzis can work pretty well.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Males, if you are looking to conceive in the 60 days</p>
<p>following sauna or hot tub,</p>
<p>do realize that both those approaches</p>
<p>do severely limit the number of motile sperm,</p>
<p>substantially so.</p>
<p>For people that are not trying to conceive,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that this works reliably enough</p>
<p>that you could use it as a form of contraception.</p>
<p>But for people that are trying to conceive,</p>
<p>it really is detrimental to sperm health, right?</p>
<p>And so for that reason,</p>
<p>some people will bring an ice pack</p>
<p>and put it on the groin or near the groin when they go in,</p>
<p>which is harder to do in a hot tub than a sauna.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re getting into the fine points</p>
<p>or crude points, if you will, pun intended.</p>
<p>But the idea is that we wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone</p>
<p>to approach these techniques</p>
<p>and compromise their other life goals inadvertently.</p>
<p>I was not allowed anywhere near these things</p>
<p>when we were at that stage of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say that Natasha put an X-ray on me</p>
<p>hanging out with Laird, so.</p>
<p>Oh, going in the sauna?</p>
<p>For those reasons, she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going in, you&rsquo;re not going,</p>
<p>none of this stuff, and I just had to wait.</p>
<p>Right, heat and sperm have a relationship,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not one that&rsquo;s positive for the sperm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>and wellbeing can only be analyzed</p>
<p>from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests</p>
<p>out there, however, is that you get information back</p>
<p>about various levels of lipids and hormones</p>
<p>and metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes knowing what to do</p>
<p>with all that information exceedingly easy.</p>
<p>They have a personalized platform that lets you see</p>
<p>what your specific numbers are, of course,</p>
<p>but then also what sorts of behavioral do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional changes,</p>
<p>what sorts of supplementation would allow you</p>
<p>to bring those levels into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you.</p>

<p>Are there ways to combine the various types of stimuli</p>
<p>that you described for inducing recovery?</p>
<p>You talked about breathing-based tools,</p>
<p>which, while they could adjust and indeed do adjust</p>
<p>oxygen and carbon dioxide ratios and et cetera,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the major effect of those on recovery</p>
<p>is going to be neural.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be deliberate calming of the nervous system,</p>
<p>more sympathetic-based, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, most definitely.</p>
<p>And then you talked about some movement-based</p>
<p>and touch-based approaches,</p>
<p>which will movement certainly will circulate blood,</p>
<p>but also will generate contractions of the muscles,</p>
<p>which may be, if indeed, again, it&rsquo;s still speculation,</p>
<p>if indeed some of the soreness is due to excessive stretch</p>
<p>or swelling at the stretch ends of the muscles,</p>
<p>that would make sense.</p>
<p>So movement and touch and then thermal.</p>
<p>Are there ways to combine these that are more effective</p>
<p>or maybe even synergistic?</p>
<p>Yeah, I suppose you could throw on some compression garment,</p>
<p>put on a pneumatic compression device</p>
<p>and sit in the sauna while you down-regulate your breath.</p>
<p>Like, that would be fine.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, though, you probably don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to maximize all of them.</p>
<p>We were joking.</p>
<p>You could probably go for a light swim</p>
<p>while regulating your breathing in cold water.</p>
<p>You would get the compression from the cold water</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be in a good spot.</p>
<p>So you could certainly do that.</p>
<p>The reality is I generally look for some physical approach</p>
<p>and then some holistic approach of the breath work, basically.</p>
<p>So I want breath and then something else.</p>
<p>If you knock those two things out, you&rsquo;re in a good spot.</p>
<p>So that could be breath while you&rsquo;re in thermal stress.</p>
<p>So just controlling and doing the down-regulation stuff.</p>
<p>You have to also remember ice is a stressor.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll actually show you some data here in a second</p>
<p>about how that actually can enhance</p>
<p>systemic recovery.</p>
<p>Although it won&rsquo;t happen in the acute minutes.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s gonna take at least 30 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll eventually see a rebound effect.</p>
<p>But acutely, it&rsquo;s going to make you actually</p>
<p>more sympathetic, which is going the other direction.</p>
<p>Heat can do the opposite.</p>
<p>Or it can actually drive you up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit dependent upon how you respond,</p>
<p>what time of day, and how you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>So in general, I guess, combining them is</p>
<p>if you need it,</p>
<p>depending on what you have and what&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>So perhaps you don&rsquo;t have a sauna,</p>
<p>but you can take a hot bath.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Maybe you have some percussion device, some tool,</p>
<p>and you can use that, but you don&rsquo;t have a sauna.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have ice bath, these things.</p>
<p>So I think rather than thinking about</p>
<p>an optimal combination of them,</p>
<p>I would say just use a couple of the tactics</p>
<p>based on what you have</p>
<p>and what is easily available in your situation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to teach us about some of the methods</p>
<p>for longer form recovery,</p>
<p>as it relates to overreaching and overtraining.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You want to think about this in a couple of phases.</p>
<p>Phase one is to try to prevent it</p>
<p>from happening in the first place.</p>
<p>In terms of training load,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to just go back to our previous episodes</p>
<p>where we give you specific instructions</p>
<p>for how much to increase your volume</p>
<p>and intensity per week, et cetera.</p>
<p>The other thing you can do then is do some monitoring.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll go over some different tools,</p>
<p>some cost-free ones,</p>
<p>as well as some higher tech,</p>
<p>like logically demanding ones,</p>
<p>to monitor to see if it&rsquo;s actually happening.</p>
<p>And then the third approach here is,</p>
<p>what if this has already occurred?</p>
<p>I figured it out, how do I get back out of that hole?</p>
<p>So I would like to just sort of tackle</p>
<p>these one by one in order</p>
<p>and talk about what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>what tools you can use,</p>
<p>and why they&rsquo;re going to work.</p>
<p>All right, so anytime we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about fatigue management here,</p>
<p>most people are aware of these terms</p>
<p>because if you have any sort of technology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably getting some sort of readiness score</p>
<p>or recovery score or strain,</p>
<p>depending on which app or watch or tech you have.</p>
<p>You have a little bit of vernacular change.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the sport performance world,</p>
<p>you might be looking at things, again,</p>
<p>like load or GPS tracking and monitoring.</p>
<p>And really all of it is doing the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to either, one,</p>
<p>predict a problem is going to happen in the future</p>
<p>and then placing restrictions upon you</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t run into that situation.</p>
<p>The other thing it&rsquo;s possibly doing</p>
<p>is identifying a drop in physiology or performance</p>
<p>and then saying, we need to get you out of this hole.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And so when we think of the first one,</p>
<p>just imagine a scenario like a mileage limitation,</p>
<p>pitch count in baseball.</p>
<p>And what has happened there is individuals</p>
<p>in those fields have looked and said,</p>
<p>hey, what we notice is people who throw, say,</p>
<p>more than 100 pitches in a game</p>
<p>tend to start losing effectiveness</p>
<p>and increase injury rate.</p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re predicting the next time you go to play,</p>
<p>if you cross that threshold,</p>
<p>we start having an increased risk of negative consequences.</p>
<p>So therefore, we&rsquo;re going to cap your,</p>
<p>in this case, pitching volume</p>
<p>at that 100 pitches per game or whatever the case.</p>
<p>Same thing with running, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you could just simply do that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually really cool data</p>
<p>coming out now on sport performance stuff,</p>
<p>looking at things like IMUs and GPS trackers</p>
<p>and trying to identify even position by position</p>
<p>specific recommendations</p>
<p>for how much distance you should cover in a practice,</p>
<p>in a training session, so that you can say,</p>
<p>hey, these positions don&rsquo;t cross this threshold.</p>
<p>These positions don&rsquo;t cross this threshold</p>
<p>in basketball and tennis and all kinds of things like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not probably extremely applicable</p>
<p>to many of the listeners right now,</p>
<p>but it is still conveying the idea</p>
<p>that if we understand where we break,</p>
<p>then we can stop ourselves</p>
<p>from getting there in the first place.</p>
<p>The functional example here</p>
<p>is just thinking about basic things</p>
<p>like where do I start my training program</p>
<p>and then how do I progress it?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve already covered those numbers.</p>
<p>In either case, though, you want to have three markers</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re paying attention to.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned you&rsquo;re getting into an overreaching phase</p>
<p>or potentially going to lead to overtraining</p>
<p>or you want to get out, it&rsquo;s three unique things.</p>
<p>Number one, we&rsquo;re going to look</p>
<p>for some sort of performance metric, right?</p>
<p>So this could be your times are going down.</p>
<p>Your squat numbers, your power is going down,</p>
<p>any of these things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got to be an actual performance.</p>
<p>Number two, some sort of physiology.</p>
<p>And so I want to see something happening</p>
<p>with resting heart rate.</p>
<p>Some biomarker is moving.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability, some other measure</p>
<p>that is not influenced by you.</p>
<p>And the beauty of using biological markers</p>
<p>are if we contrast that to like performance.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, here&rsquo;s our performance test.</p>
<p>Every day you come in, you&rsquo;re going to do a vertical jump.</p>
<p>And if one day you come in,</p>
<p>all of a sudden your vertical jump is super low,</p>
<p>I might think, oh man, maybe we&rsquo;re starting to overreach.</p>
<p>You also could be feeling lazy that day</p>
<p>and just not have jumped very high on purpose</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t want to work out.</p>
<p>The beauty of biomarkers are</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to manipulate them like that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a downside to it,</p>
<p>which is maybe they&rsquo;re just indirect markers, right?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not telling you biological markers</p>
<p>are better than performance markers.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is you want to look at both, all right?</p>
<p>In fact, you want to look at our third category as well,</p>
<p>which is some sort of symptomology.</p>
<p>And so am I having a symptom of overreaching?</p>
<p>Am I seeing a performance decrement?</p>
<p>And then am I seeing a biological marker as well?</p>
<p>If you see all three of these popping up,</p>
<p>you have reason to believe you&rsquo;ve reached some overreaching.</p>
<p>Now, what you have not identified yet</p>
<p>is if that is functional overreaching,</p>
<p>non-functional overreaching, or true overtraining.</p>
<p>And remember, you shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling great</p>
<p>after every training session.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to cause adaptation.</p>
<p>And until you back off maybe even weeks or months later</p>
<p>to actualize the adaptation</p>
<p>and get that super compensation and performance increase,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to invest a little bit.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to go in the hole.</p>
<p>Any sport performance coach</p>
<p>is going to look at numbers throughout the year</p>
<p>and say, yeah, yeah, when we first start training</p>
<p>in preparation for the season,</p>
<p>we are going to see a drop in performance.</p>
<p>That day, that week, that&rsquo;s part of the plan though, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the stress you&rsquo;re trying to accumulate.</p>
<p>So you want to see all three of those markers.</p>
<p>You just want to pay attention to a couple of things.</p>
<p>How long are they down for?</p>
<p>A day, three days, seven days, 15 days, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re seeing a performance drop in a day,</p>
<p>and I am far away from performance,</p>
<p>so the day that I want to peak for,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do anything different.</p>
<p>If I see two days in a row drop performance, I&rsquo;m not worried.</p>
<p>If I see more than probably, in my opinion,</p>
<p>five days in a row of decrement,</p>
<p>then I might start paying attention.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in season though, or close to competition</p>
<p>or whatever that thing means to you,</p>
<p>and you see more than a couple of days in a row of dropping,</p>
<p>then you might actually want to take some steps</p>
<p>to mitigate that.</p>
<p>So it really is important you understand,</p>
<p>again, what are we trying to do?</p>
<p>Are we trying to cause adaptation?</p>
<p>How are we trying to cause adaptation?</p>
<p>And I have a very specific example of all this</p>
<p>we can run through here in a second.</p>
<p>And then of course, a bunch of tools</p>
<p>to pull you out of those phases.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s fundamentally what we&rsquo;re trying to do here.</p>
<p>I would encourage you again,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be too reactive and responsive to any one measure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cover a whole bunch of them in a second,</p>
<p>but you can get lost in different things</p>
<p>because they all have pros and cons.</p>
<p>And so I know it&rsquo;s simple</p>
<p>to just look at one score on your watch</p>
<p>and make your decisions because of that or check your app,</p>
<p>but you really want to be careful of doing that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to probably lead yourself</p>
<p>in the wrong direction more often</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;re going to help yourself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to why when we overreach too much</p>
<p>or too often, or we are overtraining,</p>
<p>that performance is diminished.</p>
<p>Because on the face of it, it&rsquo;s kind of obvious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re overreaching, you&rsquo;re overtraining,</p>
<p>so performance is diminished.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s completely circular.</p>
<p>You hear about things like adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>and adrenal burnout.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out adrenal burnout</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even really exist.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And there is such a thing</p>
<p>as adrenal insufficiency syndrome,</p>
<p>but these phrases like burnout, adrenal burnout,</p>
<p>overtraining, they&rsquo;re thrown around</p>
<p>as much as words like gaslighting and obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>are without any real clinical definition</p>
<p>or there are clinical definitions,</p>
<p>but people aren&rsquo;t obeying them when they use the language.</p>
<p>I do want to acknowledge, however,</p>
<p>what is absolutely true,</p>
<p>which is that overreaching too much too often,</p>
<p>overtraining, these can degrade performance.</p>
<p>But mechanistically speaking, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Because I think if once we understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on mechanistically,</p>
<p>then I think we can all look at tools,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s breathing, movement,</p>
<p>compression, thermal, psychological, motivational, et cetera.</p>
<p>And have a much clearer sense</p>
<p>as to what&rsquo;s going to work best and what likely won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I love this question so much</p>
<p>because as I mentioned at the beginning,</p>
<p>I was fortunate to spend some of my graduate work</p>
<p>in Andy Fry&rsquo;s lab at the University of Memphis.</p>
<p>And we did a lot in this area.</p>
<p>And so we, in fact, this is how I learned how to do assays</p>
<p>and run Western blots and measure signaling proteins</p>
<p>and things like this.</p>
<p>So this stuff is near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p>We also did a bunch of really wild studies</p>
<p>and he had done some before I got there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to combine kind of Andy Fry&rsquo;s entire career</p>
<p>and just highlight some of the big pictures</p>
<p>of what he found there.</p>
<p>He was very interested in exercise,</p>
<p>particularly strength training,</p>
<p>and trying to figure out this entire question, right?</p>
<p>Which is like, why is this actually happening?</p>
<p>When I work out too much, when I lift too much,</p>
<p>that all of a sudden I can&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>Why is my energy down?</p>
<p>Why is my mood, my motivation reduced if I squat too much?</p>
<p>And so we did a whole series of studies across his career.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll just sort of highlight</p>
<p>some of the themes that ran through them.</p>
<p>So the first one that jumps out to mind</p>
<p>is early in his career,</p>
<p>he did this really awesome protocol</p>
<p>where he had people squat 100% of their back squat max</p>
<p>every day for two weeks.</p>
<p>So you come into the gym</p>
<p>and I think this first one was on a machine</p>
<p>and you did a one rep max.</p>
<p>And then you came back in every single day for two weeks.</p>
<p>So these are what we would generally call</p>
<p>kind of like that short to moderate range overreaching.</p>
<p>And by definition, some of them end up</p>
<p>actually being true over training</p>
<p>because it would take the individuals</p>
<p>sometimes two to up to eight weeks</p>
<p>to return back to their one rep max</p>
<p>at the end of these protocols.</p>
<p>So some of them were non-functional overreaching</p>
<p>or some combination of that.</p>
<p>Well, along with that, he took a lot of blood samples</p>
<p>as well as muscle biopsies</p>
<p>to try to look at what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Endocrinologically, neurologically,</p>
<p>muscle physiology-wise to pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So a couple of things that jump out there.</p>
<p>One of his initial studies,</p>
<p>actually I think the very first one he did</p>
<p>when they ran that first squat everyday protocol,</p>
<p>what they found is catecholamine levels</p>
<p>changed quite significantly.</p>
<p>And depending on kind of what you wanted</p>
<p>to pay attention to there,</p>
<p>whether it was epinephrine or norepinephrine</p>
<p>or even some other markers,</p>
<p>they basically increased by somewhere</p>
<p>between two to three-fold.</p>
<p>And so a little bit of understanding of sleep physiology,</p>
<p>if adrenaline is extremely high,</p>
<p>epinephrine, you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time sleeping.</p>
<p>So that alone was first indication.</p>
<p>This is like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s actually happening here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just beyond muscle soreness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some sort of systemic fatigue happening.</p>
<p>And as you rightfully pointed out,</p>
<p>is not the adrenal glands becoming fatigued.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of a bit of tongue in cheek at pedantics.</p>
<p>It is cortisol dysregulation</p>
<p>and general stress syndrome.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really can be noted in blood</p>
<p>in terms of epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Another study he had done of a similar realm</p>
<p>was over the course of seven and a half days,</p>
<p>people came in and did 15 training sessions.</p>
<p>So it was really cool.</p>
<p>These are these really short bouts</p>
<p>of just ridiculous training.</p>
<p>And they said, okay, like something&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s happening with testosterone.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it look like inside the cell?</p>
<p>So now muscle biopsies came on board.</p>
<p>And they started looking at things like MAP kinases,</p>
<p>which are these signaling proteins</p>
<p>that tend to be associated with an anabolic response.</p>
<p>They upregulate muscle protein synthesis</p>
<p>and they do many other things,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like a big factor of them.</p>
<p>They looked at various androgens</p>
<p>and glucocorticoid receptors.</p>
<p>And they wanted to see like,</p>
<p>well maybe receptor density and or sensitivity is changing.</p>
<p>And in fact, surprise, surprise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what they found.</p>
<p>So they found both androgen</p>
<p>and glucocorticoid receptor concentrations were reduced.</p>
<p>And so you can start to see a picture forming,</p>
<p>which is like, hmm,</p>
<p>very similar to the insulin type two diabetes story,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve really put yourself</p>
<p>in a very high stress situation.</p>
<p>So presumably epinephrine, et cetera,</p>
<p>testosterone releases are extremely high.</p>
<p>In response to that,</p>
<p>to try to reach back to some level of homeostasis,</p>
<p>you start down regulating the receptors for them.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like the signal can only get so high.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna keep that gas on,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna pull back the throttle and the receptors</p>
<p>so that the total signal stays the same,</p>
<p>if that makes a little bit of sense.</p>
<p>Well, that becomes obviously problematic.</p>
<p>So then like a final follow-up study here</p>
<p>that is important to note is,</p>
<p>they did another protocol, which was really, really cool.</p>
<p>And they said, the first ones weren&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>So how about this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna come in every day for two weeks</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to do 10 sets of a one rep max every day.</p>
<p>So they were coming in and they would do 10 one rep maxes</p>
<p>every day for two weeks.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool about that study,</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t complete any of the repetitions,</p>
<p>they had to repeat it until they had 10 successful</p>
<p>one rep maxes on that given day.</p>
<p>Absolutely brutal, brutal protocol.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there at the time.</p>
<p>They had finished that right before I got on campus,</p>
<p>but I was actually able to be around</p>
<p>when they were doing some of the final analysis</p>
<p>there of the tissue.</p>
<p>What they wanna look at in this particular study</p>
<p>was beta adrenergic receptors,</p>
<p>which are those receptors that are gonna be epinephrine</p>
<p>and such are gonna be binding for.</p>
<p>So again, similar story here.</p>
<p>Perhaps are we losing overall sensitivity</p>
<p>because of this extreme sympathetic stimulation?</p>
<p>Now, actually thinking back,</p>
<p>what would have been pretty cool</p>
<p>is if they had another group that did it</p>
<p>and then did some down regulation breathing posts</p>
<p>to see if that can ameliorate some of the problems.</p>
<p>But no, of course this was 20 plus years ago</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So a couple of things that happened</p>
<p>is the one rep maxes dropped by,</p>
<p>I think around like eight kilos</p>
<p>by the end of the two weeks.</p>
<p>If I remember right,</p>
<p>like the group average was something</p>
<p>in the neighborhood of 151 kilos.</p>
<p>So these were pretty well-trained individuals.</p>
<p>And it went from a rather,</p>
<p>I think actually it was about 160 kilos</p>
<p>and they dropped to like 152 kilos,</p>
<p>something close to that.</p>
<p>What was more significant though</p>
<p>was their power dropped by 35%,</p>
<p>which is really, really interesting</p>
<p>because if you pay attention to declines</p>
<p>in physical performance over time,</p>
<p>and I mean that like through aging,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see is people can hold on</p>
<p>to muscle mass pretty well.</p>
<p>It will go down by about 1% or so after the age of 40.</p>
<p>However, strength will go down at like two to 4%</p>
<p>and then power by eight to 10%.</p>
<p>And if you look at actually world records</p>
<p>across strength sports by age,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that they will decline by age,</p>
<p>but not that much.</p>
<p>However, if you look at speed sports by age,</p>
<p>they fall off the planet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very challenging to preserve fast through time,</p>
<p>whether this is fatigue or because of age.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important because that&rsquo;ll then tell you,</p>
<p>hey, a little bit of a canary in the coal mine</p>
<p>is not necessarily your strength, but your speed.</p>
<p>And so a lot of different techniques that we use</p>
<p>to measure performance,</p>
<p>remember that&rsquo;s our triad, right?</p>
<p>Symptomology, physiology, and performance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re generally better looking</p>
<p>at speed-based performance tests</p>
<p>rather than strength-based performance tests</p>
<p>to get an earlier indication of potential overreaching</p>
<p>or overtraining.</p>
<p>So anyways, back to the individual study there.</p>
<p>In that same group, again, we have the same problem</p>
<p>where it took some of them two to eight weeks to come back.</p>
<p>So what they had to do is,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the exact timeframe.</p>
<p>I probably should have thought through this,</p>
<p>but they had to come back something like every week</p>
<p>or every couple of days, even after the study finished,</p>
<p>until they got back to their baseline one rep max.</p>
<p>And some of them, it took them up to eight weeks</p>
<p>before they finally got back.</p>
<p>So they probably were in a classic overtraining state</p>
<p>at that point, which was done in as little as two weeks.</p>
<p>And this is also another point</p>
<p>that people always ask, how long does it take?</p>
<p>Is this something that has to happen</p>
<p>over the course of months?</p>
<p>Or if I were to go do two days</p>
<p>or this intense training camp for two or three weeks,</p>
<p>could I actually cause overtraining?</p>
<p>And the answer is, if it is actually truly enough volume</p>
<p>and enough intensity,</p>
<p>you probably can do some significant damage</p>
<p>in as little as two weeks.</p>
<p>Probably doesn&rsquo;t happen that often.</p>
<p>Most likely, you&rsquo;re probably going to be reaching</p>
<p>a state of non-functional overreaching,</p>
<p>but you may actually be able to put yourself in a position</p>
<p>where it might take three or four weeks or more</p>
<p>to get back to baseline after a truly intense.</p>
<p>And again, think about this protocol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like totally unrealistic for the most part.</p>
<p>10 sets of one of a one rep max squat</p>
<p>every day for two straight weeks.</p>
<p>Some folks, if you&rsquo;re extremely highly trained weightlifter,</p>
<p>you might do something like that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re very close to say world championships.</p>
<p>But outside of that really specific scenario,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a totally absurd training protocol.</p>
<p>But that was the point, right?</p>
<p>We were trying to ensure that overtraining was met or close.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to when we&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve actually done I think three studies</p>
<p>in the Center for Support Performance</p>
<p>on DOMS muscle soreness.</p>
<p>And in all those cases,</p>
<p>you do just like ridiculous leg extension protocols</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just trying to ensure you cause</p>
<p>super soreness.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t, then you have nothing to study.</p>
<p>So absurd training protocols, but that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>So nonetheless, as a result, sure enough,</p>
<p>the beta adrenergic receptors were downregulated</p>
<p>by something like 37%.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s probably even more significant though</p>
<p>was the sensitivity in those receptors</p>
<p>was reduced by like two and a half fold.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, okay, wait a minute,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re becoming desensitized to this stimuli.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also actually now starting</p>
<p>to reduce our total concentration.</p>
<p>Similar, which is actually an interesting,</p>
<p>was a very sneaky smart thing to do</p>
<p>is they looked at nocturnal urinary epinephrine</p>
<p>and guess what?</p>
<p>That was also up by like 50%.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>15, one, five.</p>
<p>Five, zero.</p>
<p>Five, zero.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so now you&rsquo;re seeing this tie-in</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, hmm,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a response at the tissue level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a response probably,</p>
<p>although they didn&rsquo;t actually look</p>
<p>at a pituitary or anything like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing adrenal and other endocrinological problems.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m also seeing this increase</p>
<p>in concentration of epinephrine</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m supposed to be sleeping.</p>
<p>And surprise, surprise,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a hard time sleeping, symptomology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting finding</p>
<p>about nocturnal epinephrine.</p>
<p>Epinephrine, of course, is adrenaline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released from the adrenals, no surprise there,</p>
<p>but also from this brain area called locus coeruleus</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>And the brain tends to be called epinephrine</p>
<p>in the body, adrenaline,</p>
<p>just to complicate everyone&rsquo;s understanding.</p>
<p>But that nomenclature did not come from us.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t blame us.</p>
<p>The point is that rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>so-called REM sleep,</p>
<p>is more abundant in the second half of the night.</p>
<p>We know that the dreams associated</p>
<p>with rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>are more emotionally laden,</p>
<p>and that those dreams and those emotional states</p>
<p>are actually important for discarding the emotional load</p>
<p>of previous day&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sort of a natural trauma therapy, if you will,</p>
<p>because in the normal healthy state,</p>
<p>those dreams are associated with an inability</p>
<p>to release epinephrine at night.</p>
<p>So for me, what you just described,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever heard of it,</p>
<p>but it ties together something really quite clear</p>
<p>from the sleep neuroscience literature,</p>
<p>which is that when people are stressed,</p>
<p>they tend to get less rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>That rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>normally is associated with low levels of epinephrine.</p>
<p>So whether or not it&rsquo;s causal or not isn&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>but sort of doesn&rsquo;t matter for sake of this discussion.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m wondering,</p>
<p>and I suppose one could test for, but maybe observed,</p>
<p>is whether or not people who are overtraining too much,</p>
<p>overreaching too much,</p>
<p>because of this elevated nocturnal epinephrine,</p>
<p>diminished REM sleep,</p>
<p>whether or not their emotional state is also disrupted.</p>
<p>Because one thing we know for sure</p>
<p>is if you want to disrupt somebody&rsquo;s emotional state,</p>
<p>you deprive them of sleep</p>
<p>and rapid eye movement sleep in particular.</p>
<p>The one caveat to that is,</p>
<p>for those of you out there that have heard</p>
<p>that rapid eye movement sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>deliberate rapid eye movement sleep deprivation</p>
<p>is a treatment for depression, that is true,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s coupled with a next night</p>
<p>enhanced rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So one of the major takeaways from all of this</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m realizing is that no surprise,</p>
<p>daytime activities impact nighttime endocrine function,</p>
<p>impact quality of sleep, impact daytime activities.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually there&rsquo;s so many fun things</p>
<p>I want to do here now.</p>
<p>This is actually why measuring eye movement</p>
<p>is a very fantastic tool</p>
<p>for understanding total stress load.</p>
<p>And you can actually differentiate</p>
<p>different types of stress.</p>
<p>So caffeine use versus alcohol use versus sleep deprivation</p>
<p>by actually measuring eye movements.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what we do</p>
<p>in our Absolute Rest Sleep Company</p>
<p>In addition to getting a full PSD sleep study</p>
<p>done in your bedroom,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get an eye tracking assessment,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re gonna be able to figure out</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>So nonetheless, yeah, if you actually look</p>
<p>at the classic signs and symptoms of overtraining</p>
<p>or overtraining syndrome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be everything from performance decrements</p>
<p>like we talked about,</p>
<p>resting heart rate is going to increase.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna see things like HRV drop</p>
<p>by generally 20 or so percent.</p>
<p>That would be a very large disruption in HRV,</p>
<p>decreased body weight,</p>
<p>and then all the stuff Andrew just talked about.</p>
<p>So motivation, adherence, appetite, mood,</p>
<p>all of this stuff are classically known associations</p>
<p>with overtraining.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for the exact reasons you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>sleep disturbances and disruptions,</p>
<p>wanting to train, motivation,</p>
<p>all of this stuff goes part and parcel</p>
<p>with non-functional overreaching and or overtraining.</p>
<p>You can actually tie this back in</p>
<p>a little bit more to some other biomarkers.</p>
<p>And this is great because this is the stuff we look for.</p>
<p>This is the physiology stuff we look for.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably talked about SHBG before,</p>
<p>which is a sex hormone binding globulin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this protein that&rsquo;ll float in your body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna bind up sex hormones,</p>
<p>in particular testosterone.</p>
<p>So what happens with overtraining</p>
<p>is you can actually take this serially, like week by week,</p>
<p>and you can actually see this number rise.</p>
<p>And so if you see this,</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re using a service like InsideTracker</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting your blood measured every so often,</p>
<p>and you see this number start ticking up,</p>
<p>this is actually associated with that</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s actually happening</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s binding up all your free testosterone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just leading back</p>
<p>to the circle we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And you can actually see the same thing happen</p>
<p>with calorie restriction, just not eating enough calories.</p>
<p>But in this particular case,</p>
<p>because it actually happens in both scenarios,</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not an issue simply of being undercaloried.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly an issue of the training load being too high.</p>
<p>So just to give another little tool,</p>
<p>I can get the link for it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a website that was created by,</p>
<p>which journal, oh, I&rsquo;m slipping,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll get it to you, you can link it up,</p>
<p>where you can actually go in</p>
<p>and plug in a number of values from blood chemistry.</p>
<p>So if you got your blood work done,</p>
<p>and you can plug in your pre-number and your post-number.</p>
<p>So say you got it done,</p>
<p>and then maybe 10 weeks later, you got it done again.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re wondering,</p>
<p>and you notice, hey, my free testosterone is down,</p>
<p>or my SHBG is up.</p>
<p>Is it actually a meaningful number?</p>
<p>And it will actually tell you whether or not</p>
<p>the change pre to post is physiologically meaningful or not,</p>
<p>or just within the error margin of the measure.</p>
<p>And you can actually change,</p>
<p>like right there on the website,</p>
<p>you can change your confidence interval.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, really cool if you just have your own blood</p>
<p>and you want to know like,</p>
<p>hey, I had any level this year,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s here over there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a totally free resource created,</p>
<p>gone through peer review, all that stuff,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give you a link to that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a pretty cool measure.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>like probably one of the more powerful and easy metrics</p>
<p>biologically is to take your cortisol and DHEA ratio.</p>
<p>So this is known to be associated with a lot of things.</p>
<p>You want to be really careful.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want this number to be too high or too low.</p>
<p>Something like 0.09 is about the right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cortisol to DHEA.</p>
<p>DHEA to cortisol ratio, yeah.</p>
<p>DHEA to cortisol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to tell you, I said it backwards on purpose</p>
<p>just to make sure everyone understood,</p>
<p>but I got it backwards.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, this ratio has been associated with so many things.</p>
<p>You have to do,</p>
<p>you do have to be careful with association, right?</p>
<p>Not being causation,</p>
<p>but everything from risk of infections</p>
<p>and metabolic health and like other disease states,</p>
<p>as well as more of what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is, hey, am I getting sort of cortisol dysregulation,</p>
<p>which is what a lot of folks would call,</p>
<p>you know, again, adrenal fatigue,</p>
<p>as you know, that&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but if adrenaline and epinephrine are off and testosterone,</p>
<p>cortisol is going to be along the right.</p>
<p>And so you can also look at things like</p>
<p>testosterone to cortisol ratios.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can glean here</p>
<p>to give you some insights into where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>If that ratio is too high,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be associated with metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>and a bunch of other stuff.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too low,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be associated</p>
<p>with a lot of cognitive problems,</p>
<p>like aggression and mood and a bunch of things like that.</p>
<p>So again, you want to keep it right around that 0.09 ratio.</p>
<p>And most of the time, actually,</p>
<p>in some blood chemistry stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a report of that</p>
<p>or you can calculate it pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get into this in the episode</p>
<p>that comes next on nutrition and supplementation.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>What about compounds that lower cortisol,</p>
<p>such as ashwagandha?</p>
<p>I can see now, based on the logic you&rsquo;re spelling out,</p>
<p>that during phases of a lot of intense overreaching</p>
<p>or frequent overreaching,</p>
<p>given that those compounds can indeed lower cortisol,</p>
<p>rhodolia rosacea.</p>
<p>Rhodiola.</p>
<p>Rhodiola rosacea.</p>
<p>Fun word to say.</p>
<p>Two words, but the first one, more fun to say.</p>
<p>Rhodiola rhodacea.</p>
<p>Rhodiola rosea.</p>
<p>Rhodiola rosea, folks.</p>
<p>And ashwagandha.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying rhodiola recently</p>
<p>and mainly as a buffer to output.</p>
<p>It does seem to have some good data attached to it</p>
<p>related to lowering one&rsquo;s perceived threshold</p>
<p>of how hard they&rsquo;re working.</p>
<p>So in other words, you can work harder</p>
<p>and not feel as if you&rsquo;re working really hard,</p>
<p>which allows you to do more work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the subjective description</p>
<p>of how it works.</p>
<p>But you told me that it can blunt cortisol</p>
<p>and ashwagandha, we know, blunts cortisol.</p>
<p>Both of these things, of course, can do other things,</p>
<p>but are these compounds that you sometimes</p>
<p>will incorporate into a training regimen?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using rhodiola for probably six or more years.</p>
<p>Like pretty consistently, not personally,</p>
<p>but using it with the individual we work with.</p>
<p>You do need to be a little bit careful.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it blunts cortisol.</p>
<p>It is probably more appropriately described</p>
<p>as a cortisol modulator,</p>
<p>which means sort of if it gets too high or too low,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll help kind of keep it within normative range.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, it is important to note,</p>
<p>there have been a handful of studies,</p>
<p>two of, I know specifically,</p>
<p>showed that rhodiola use can enhance strength gains.</p>
<p>However, it may reduce muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So we need more human data on this stuff,</p>
<p>and it may turn out that&rsquo;s not a concern.</p>
<p>It may also turn out to be a concern.</p>
<p>So nothing is perfect and free.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no supplement that is a panacea.</p>
<p>And I have used, again, rhodiola in a lot of situations.</p>
<p>Because the other thing you kind of have to pay attention</p>
<p>to with cortisol is it&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to be modulated throughout the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not supposed to be at this normal value.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at normative values,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s typically described in micrograms per deciliter.</p>
<p>And depending on literally what company</p>
<p>you use to draw your blood,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting it through the blood,</p>
<p>depending on which method they use to analyze it,</p>
<p>the normative values are, frankly,</p>
<p>embarrassingly all over the place.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly gonna be like five to 25</p>
<p>as a quote-unquote normative value.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s outrageous.</p>
<p>We also know those numbers vary massively by age,</p>
<p>by sex, and throughout the day.</p>
<p>And so if you only are taking a single point,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re doing a fasted blood draw,</p>
<p>which is what most folks do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really only gonna tell you a lot</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in that moment.</p>
<p>We need to know, well, maybe let&rsquo;s say my cortisol</p>
<p>was if I&rsquo;m a, say, 38-year-old woman,</p>
<p>and my 7 a.m. cortisol was 15 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s 15 milligrams per deciliter at 3 p.m.,</p>
<p>ooh, boy, I&rsquo;m probably having some issues.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a change throughout the day,</p>
<p>and you need to be able to plot that curve.</p>
<p>So you can actually, well,</p>
<p>pretty standard practice that we do</p>
<p>is we look at cortisol throughout the day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take multiple markers,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna just see your baseline cortisol.</p>
<p>I wanna see this curve throughout the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna tell me a ton about, again,</p>
<p>is your sleep being caused by dysregulation?</p>
<p>Is it your training?</p>
<p>Is it something else?</p>
<p>So I would take a single baseline blood marker of cortisol</p>
<p>with a lot of grain of salt.</p>
<p>We typically measure it at least three times</p>
<p>throughout the day, so something like 6 to 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>12 to 3, and then something like closer to the evening.</p>
<p>Oftentimes we do much more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do like seven points or something like that</p>
<p>throughout the day, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>So you wanna be careful of that.</p>
<p>Just since we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>you can also get cortisol through saliva.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s sort of pros and cons to that,</p>
<p>because the pro of doing it in your blood</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s much more stable.</p>
<p>Saliva is extremely responsive to whatever happened</p>
<p>the seconds before you took that test.</p>
<p>The upside of it, though,</p>
<p>is you can do a bunch of real-world life experiments.</p>
<p>So for example, we will do this sometimes</p>
<p>if we wanna see how an individual is responding</p>
<p>to a given stressor.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take it, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take it and then spit it into a tube.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take it,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna go do this workout</p>
<p>or this cold exposure, whatever we&rsquo;re gonna do,</p>
<p>take it at the end.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s responsive to what just happened,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>So you can actually, there&rsquo;s sort of pros and cons.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll use the appropriate measure</p>
<p>for the appropriate question you&rsquo;re trying to answer.</p>
<p>A couple of points and reflections about cortisol.</p>
<p>My first laboratory duty as an undergraduate</p>
<p>was actually in a biopsychology lab.</p>
<p>At the time, they didn&rsquo;t have the field of neuroscience</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s now called.</p>
<p>It was called biopsychology or psychobiology.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>No, there used to be neurochemistry, neurobiology.</p>
<p>They had all collapsed into what we now call neuroscience,</p>
<p>which was only some years ago.</p>
<p>But my job was to collect cortisol samples,</p>
<p>which means I was collecting spit,</p>
<p>which means I was collecting saliva.</p>
<p>And an advantage of saliva-based cortisol,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s free cortisol, it&rsquo;s the active form.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, it&rsquo;s reflective of what happened</p>
<p>in the seconds or minutes just prior.</p>
<p>A couple of things about the regular cortisol pattern</p>
<p>across the day, because I realized that</p>
<p>while it would be wonderful for everybody</p>
<p>to get their cortisol measured in detail multiple times</p>
<p>in blood and saliva and so on,</p>
<p>some people just won&rsquo;t do that for whatever reason</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>The basic contour of a healthy pattern</p>
<p>of cortisol secretion is to have highest levels of cortisol</p>
<p>in the morning is actually part of the mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with waking you up.</p>
<p>Viewing bright light, ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>but other forms of bright light early in the day</p>
<p>actually can lead to a 50%, five, zero percent increase</p>
<p>in that cortisol spike, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>People hear elevated cortisol, oh no.</p>
<p>But this sets in motion a cascade of things</p>
<p>related to enhanced mood and alertness,</p>
<p>immune system function, et cetera.</p>
<p>What I think it can be useful for people to understand</p>
<p>is that many things will spike cortisol</p>
<p>throughout the day, stress, cold water, exercise.</p>
<p>But the idea is that it comes down to baseline</p>
<p>or near baseline rather quickly.</p>
<p>One of the worst situations, as you pointed out,</p>
<p>is when the highest level of cortisol</p>
<p>is consistently shifted to the afternoon period.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s a pretty reliable signature</p>
<p>of certain forms of depression.</p>
<p>This is work by my colleague David Spiegel</p>
<p>at Stanford Psychiatry and the great Bob Sapolsky,</p>
<p>Robert Sapolsky, of why zebras don&rsquo;t get ulcers,</p>
<p>behave, et cetera, and fame.</p>
<p>Lots of popular books there.</p>
<p>I think that if people are trying to regulate</p>
<p>their cortisol and they just understand that basic contour,</p>
<p>that the baseline should rise pretty quickly</p>
<p>after one rises in the morning.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy to remember, rise, rise.</p>
<p>Rise out of bed and rise cortisol with light,</p>
<p>bright light, with exercise, with caffeine.</p>
<p>These things will all increase cortisol.</p>
<p>And then across the day, it&rsquo;s normal for cortisol to spike.</p>
<p>But then to use some of the down-regulation methods</p>
<p>that you described, in particular the breathing methods,</p>
<p>and exercise itself, as the case may be,</p>
<p>but then to really pay attention</p>
<p>to how much psychological and physical stress</p>
<p>is occurring in the six hours or so</p>
<p>or eight hours prior to sleep.</p>
<p>Does that seem like a good sort of broad contour</p>
<p>of how to have a healthy pattern of cortisol release?</p>
<p>Because you actually want the cortisol</p>
<p>to reduce inflammation and initiate</p>
<p>or participate in the recovery process.</p>
<p>You will not see any progress from exercise training</p>
<p>without a large spike in cortisol.</p>
<p>It is critically important,</p>
<p>when we think of phrases like cortisol,</p>
<p>inflammation, stress, this is not bad.</p>
<p>Physiology is not personified, right?</p>
<p>Things don&rsquo;t like, hate you in the body, right?</p>
<p>It is all, it&rsquo;s not good and bad.</p>
<p>They just are.</p>
<p>The more you try to suppress cortisol,</p>
<p>the more you suppress adaptation.</p>
<p>What you want is exactly what you mentioned.</p>
<p>Large spikes met with large, quick recovery.</p>
<p>And you want to do that throughout the day</p>
<p>and get that hormetic stressor.</p>
<p>So, going back to your ashwagandha and rhodiola issue,</p>
<p>I think it would be very short-sighted</p>
<p>for people to do that as this is a prophylactic.</p>
<p>If you blunt cortisol,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to cause immunosuppressant.</p>
<p>Especially early in the day.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Taking ashwagandha before going to train</p>
<p>is counterproductive.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do not just,</p>
<p>this is not a baseline part of our foundational package.</p>
<p>If you go look at the athlete foundations</p>
<p>or the athlete resilience protocols</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve also put together,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to see these things in there</p>
<p>for that specific reason.</p>
<p>Any form of cortisol regulation</p>
<p>needs to be done strategically.</p>
<p>If you are excessively high</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re bringing you back down to normative values</p>
<p>at the right time, then great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re normal though,</p>
<p>then taking you down lower than that</p>
<p>is actually problematic.</p>
<p>The same thing is actually true since we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>For oxidative stress, for inflammation, antioxidant use.</p>
<p>We mentioned, I think earlier,</p>
<p>about taking vitamin C and vitamin E post-exercise</p>
<p>will actually blunt adaptations.</p>
<p>Or at least it has the potential to do so.</p>
<p>Same thing, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re modulating this response just because,</p>
<p>and you have not done so</p>
<p>because of actually biological testing</p>
<p>that indicated you needed to do such,</p>
<p>then you actually may be making things worse.</p>
<p>And so we see this constantly with people</p>
<p>who take a number of supplements and substances for sleep</p>
<p>and then they wake up the next morning groggy</p>
<p>and your cortisol is suppressed.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So then they take something for stimulation</p>
<p>and then the rest of the day they&rsquo;re trying to reduce.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re in this nasty cycle</p>
<p>instead of just getting out of the way</p>
<p>and letting cortisol do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do.</p>
<p>And then making sure, again, you&rsquo;re teaching it.</p>
<p>So this is actually a coachable response.</p>
<p>You can coach your own body</p>
<p>to go down in the later part of the day</p>
<p>and go up in the earlier part of the day.</p>
<p>You want to make sure that you are driving that train</p>
<p>with intent.</p>
<p>And so, again, to reiterate,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t need that, you shouldn&rsquo;t do it, right?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t need to lower cortisol,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t walk around doing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going to suppress the state even far.</p>
<p>And this is needed for anabolic response.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not going to grow muscle</p>
<p>if cortisol is not spiked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to compromise it rather.</p>
<p>So you want to be intentional with these practices,</p>
<p>especially in the form of supplementation.</p>
<p>Be very, very intentional.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it said that carbohydrates,</p>
<p>in particular starchy carbohydrates,</p>
<p>can inhibit cortisol.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>And this could be through</p>
<p>the tryptophan amino acid related pathway</p>
<p>that ratchets up to serotonin release,</p>
<p>probably some other things too.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea that carbohydrates just stimulate serotonin</p>
<p>is a little bit overly simplistic.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s cellular mechanisms,</p>
<p>AMPK going up and immediately turning on there, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ve all experienced this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stressed, we&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily even have to be highly processed,</p>
<p>fat associated, fatty carbohydrates,</p>
<p>like potato chips and dip or these kinds of things.</p>
<p>It can also be a bowl of rice, a bowl of oatmeal,</p>
<p>a bowl of pasta,</p>
<p>which here I&rsquo;m not trying to demonize carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I do ingest carbohydrates,</p>
<p>minimally or non-processed carbohydrates most of the time,</p>
<p>not all the time.</p>
<p>And they have a fairly potent effect on lowering stress</p>
<p>and perceived stress and even quality of sleep,</p>
<p>which is not to say that somebody has to load up on them</p>
<p>like crazy unless their glycogen is really depleted.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about this in the endurance episode.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;ll touch on it more</p>
<p>in the nutrition supplementation episode.</p>
<p>But in thinking about the relationship</p>
<p>between carbohydrates and cortisol</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;ve just been talking about</p>
<p>in terms of cortisol as being vitally important</p>
<p>for the adaptation trigger or triggering adaptation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a better way to put it,</p>
<p>but that it can blunt cortisol,</p>
<p>take in post-training or maybe in the evening before sleep.</p>
<p>What are some of the basic ways that one can think about</p>
<p>and maybe use carbohydrates in specific ways</p>
<p>in order to, let&rsquo;s say, control cortisol</p>
<p>rather than quash cortisol?</p>
<p>You actually have alluded to it a number of times already.</p>
<p>So we oftentimes will give people</p>
<p>a lot of carbohydrates at night for some of these reasons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel fantastic.</p>
<p>A lot of people, it helps you sleep,</p>
<p>both get to sleep and stay asleep, sleep quality.</p>
<p>You talked about specifically,</p>
<p>remember, think about it this way.</p>
<p>Cortisol at its core is an energy signaling molecule.</p>
<p>It says we are in the need for energy.</p>
<p>Great, epinephrine&rsquo;s the same way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start seeing, for example,</p>
<p>cortisol will liberate free fatty acids,</p>
<p>put them in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>get you prepared to do something.</p>
<p>The problem is if it&rsquo;s continually elevated</p>
<p>throughout the day with no down regulation,</p>
<p>we start running into issues, right?</p>
<p>So again, this is the differentiation</p>
<p>between, oh, my cortisol is slightly elevated all day</p>
<p>versus I had a really big spike after training,</p>
<p>I had a really big spike after a breath protocol, et cetera,</p>
<p>and then it went back down.</p>
<p>So that being said, if you then ingest carbohydrates,</p>
<p>it is quick to see the signal,</p>
<p>oh, we have nutrients, we have energy,</p>
<p>again, specifically carbohydrates,</p>
<p>therefore cortisol can sort of go back down.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to be liberating free fatty acids</p>
<p>and preparing the need for fuel.</p>
<p>So you can help yourself go to sleep for many,</p>
<p>as you pointed out, many mechanisms actually</p>
<p>of why carbohydrates will help you sleep at night.</p>
<p>For some, not all people, but some,</p>
<p>that would be one of the relationships</p>
<p>it has with cortisol.</p>
<p>Great, I look forward to hearing more</p>
<p>about how the various micronutrients</p>
<p>and so-called adaptogens,</p>
<p>this very mysterious group of compounds,</p>
<p>the word adaptogen gets thrown around so much nowadays,</p>
<p>but as long as we&rsquo;re talking about adaptation,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll be fair play for the discussion</p>
<p>in the next episode about nutrition and supplementation.</p>
<p>In my laboratory, when we study stress,</p>
<p>we use a number of different markers,</p>
<p>subjective reports of how stressed people feel,</p>
<p>heart rate, morning heart rate, heart rate variability,</p>
<p>cortisol, free cortisol, and on and on.</p>
<p>What are some of the other markers of stress</p>
<p>as it relates to exercise adaptations and recovery?</p>
<p>Because once again, I think we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of parallels</p>
<p>between the study of psychological stress</p>
<p>and the study of physical stress</p>
<p>as it relates to exercise adaptation.</p>
<p>Remember, in terms of physiology, stress is stress.</p>
<p>This is why we have this cool term of allostatic load</p>
<p>or allostasis, such that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>which system you test for, it will reflect overall stress.</p>
<p>You mentioned several of them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got done talking about some biomarkers.</p>
<p>HRV and heart rate are another great example</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re trying to do is this.</p>
<p>When we were talking about the muscle soreness thing,</p>
<p>what we were really getting at was a marker of</p>
<p>how do I fix the overuse in that particular muscle?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve really transitioned into global markers</p>
<p>of overuse and why these are problematic</p>
<p>or important to pay attention to rather is,</p>
<p>again, these are the indicators</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t just work a muscle out too hard,</p>
<p>but you have actually done something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve compromised all of your physiology</p>
<p>to a level where you&rsquo;ve influenced</p>
<p>a circulating catecholamine</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s going to influence multiple markers</p>
<p>now like your sleep and your mood and your behavior.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why these things are problematic.</p>
<p>That said, you could look at resting heart rate,</p>
<p>not a bad thing to do.</p>
<p>However, that does have multiple downsides.</p>
<p>One thing we do know is your resting heart rate</p>
<p>will elevate with excessive stress load.</p>
<p>This actually doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is physical stress</p>
<p>or psychological stress or a combination.</p>
<p>So you will see that number drift up over time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the downside though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not tremendously sensitive to smaller stressors.</p>
<p>In other words, if you were to do something like alcohol</p>
<p>is a very good example,</p>
<p>you will see your resting heart rate elevate</p>
<p>with alcohol use, excessive tobacco use</p>
<p>and psychological stress.</p>
<p>However, if you do something smaller</p>
<p>like a hard training sessions,</p>
<p>resting heart rate is not sensitive enough to pick that up.</p>
<p>It will actually probably stay the same.</p>
<p>So for those reasons,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t actually use resting heart rate that much.</p>
<p>We will take it, but it&rsquo;s not our primary indicator.</p>
<p>That being said, HRV is a better use.</p>
<p>So just really quickly, for those that are not familiar,</p>
<p>your heart rate, let&rsquo;s say for example,</p>
<p>your resting heart rate is 60 beats per minute.</p>
<p>That means every second it&rsquo;s beating.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually happen on a consistent rhythm</p>
<p>such that it would beat on second one,</p>
<p>beat on second two, beat on second three, et cetera.</p>
<p>The rate is more variable.</p>
<p>So it might go beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a variation in the heart rate.</p>
<p>And at the end of that 60 seconds, in this example,</p>
<p>you would have still completed 60 beats.</p>
<p>They just aren&rsquo;t on the exact same pattern.</p>
<p>Well, one thing that&rsquo;s actually quite interesting</p>
<p>is the amount of variation in your heart rate</p>
<p>is actually associated with your overall sympathetic</p>
<p>or parasympathetic state such that a large variation,</p>
<p>so an arrhythmic pattern is generally more representative</p>
<p>of being more rested and recovered</p>
<p>and being more parasympathetic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice during times of extremely high stress,</p>
<p>you will be very rhythmic, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.</p>
<p>And so this is a little bit of a confusing idea,</p>
<p>but a high HRV is there indicated of a lot of variation</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re pretty recovered.</p>
<p>A low HRV meaning there&rsquo;s not a lot of variation</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re probably pretty stressed and wired.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s related to heart rate, but in my opinion,</p>
<p>it is a significantly better marker of that.</p>
<p>Now, one thing you want to pay attention to</p>
<p>if you do this, a couple of things,</p>
<p>there are some accuracy issues with many of the devices.</p>
<p>Basically everybody at this point probably has some device</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s telling them their HRV.</p>
<p>What you do not want to do is simply compare your number</p>
<p>to somebody else for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>Not all of these technologies</p>
<p>are actually even measuring the same thing.</p>
<p>Again, some of them are actually combining</p>
<p>with other metrics and calling it your overall readiness</p>
<p>or your recovery.</p>
<p>And so now what we&rsquo;ve actually done</p>
<p>is made a couple of assumptions</p>
<p>and then stack them on a whole host of other assumptions</p>
<p>and then giving you a number.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know what that sort of black box score</p>
<p>actually even represents.</p>
<p>So I would caution, one,</p>
<p>against taking too much information from that.</p>
<p>If you are actually measuring HRV, even within that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of ways to calculate it</p>
<p>that are not important here.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t necessarily worry about the score.</p>
<p>Compare it to yourself, but not to others.</p>
<p>What you will see is if you use similar devices</p>
<p>and techniques, it is hard to find data here,</p>
<p>but in general, people that are overweight</p>
<p>might have a little bit of a lower score,</p>
<p>as in a worse score.</p>
<p>We need more information on that to be clear.</p>
<p>So in large part, the best way to use something like HRV</p>
<p>is to measure it under the exact same circumstances</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re going to use just a device</p>
<p>on your watch or your phone or your bed or anything else,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna buy a special HRV monitor, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Just take that measure at the same time.</p>
<p>Mostly this means first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>So you wake up, you go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>you come back down and take your measure</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Wait, sometimes you took it before food,</p>
<p>then after, or look at your phone,</p>
<p>like all these other things that can influence stress.</p>
<p>So it usually takes somewhere between seconds to minutes</p>
<p>to record.</p>
<p>So you want to pay attention to that.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things you&rsquo;ll notice is</p>
<p>there is a natural change in your HRV that just happens.</p>
<p>So what you kind of really want to pay attention to is,</p>
<p>I guess, answering the question of how much of a change</p>
<p>in HRV has to happen before I should care?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to answer, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say your HRV was 100.</p>
<p>I just made that number up.</p>
<p>What if you wake up tomorrow and it&rsquo;s 99?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If you wake up tomorrow and it&rsquo;s 20,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a bad thing.</p>
<p>Well, where&rsquo;s that line?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>One thing I would recommend doing is taking your HRV</p>
<p>for at least a month before you start using that value</p>
<p>to make any changes.</p>
<p>And you recommend taking it first thing in the morning?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Always roughly the same time?</p>
<p>Basically, under the same circumstances.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be technically in the morning,</p>
<p>but because your day will change on most days,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you get into,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most stable thing in your life.</p>
<p>So I would take it then,</p>
<p>and I would collect it for at least a day,</p>
<p>at least a month rather, maybe even six weeks.</p>
<p>And then give yourself basically a running average.</p>
<p>So what we quite honestly do</p>
<p>is we will actually track it for forever.</p>
<p>And then what we always look at is,</p>
<p>what does it look like today</p>
<p>relative to the last week on average?</p>
<p>And then what does that look like</p>
<p>to our historical average?</p>
<p>And we always compare those things.</p>
<p>And you also wanna make sure you compare like to like.</p>
<p>So in other words, I generally will not going to worry</p>
<p>about today&rsquo;s HRV score relative to tomorrow&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>What I wanna look at is today&rsquo;s relative</p>
<p>to this exact same day last week.</p>
<p>Not for athletes, but for non-athletes,</p>
<p>this is very important.</p>
<p>So imagine, don&rsquo;t worry about the difference</p>
<p>between HRV score on Monday compared to Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pay attention to Monday compared to last Monday</p>
<p>and the Monday before that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you typically have</p>
<p>the same sort of weekly schedule.</p>
<p>And what you don&rsquo;t wanna do is say,</p>
<p>look at Monday&rsquo;s HRV score,</p>
<p>which is a reflection of what happened Sunday,</p>
<p>and compare that to Tuesday&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>which is actually a reflection of what happened Monday.</p>
<p>You probably didn&rsquo;t do the same stressors</p>
<p>on Sunday as Monday,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not actually comparing the same thing.</p>
<p>But if you have a general weekly schedule,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re likely to compare this Monday&rsquo;s</p>
<p>relative to last Monday&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both comparing what happened</p>
<p>on the previous day.</p>
<p>Did that sort of distinction make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I do the same thing with body weight, by the way,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to track body mass gain</p>
<p>or fat loss or something.</p>
<p>Compare like to like.</p>
<p>You can look at the daily changes,</p>
<p>but you need to pay attention</p>
<p>to what that normal distribution is.</p>
<p>So if you kinda do that Monday to Monday thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give you a rough area of saying,</p>
<p>okay, my normal weekly variation is, say, five.</p>
<p>So my average is 100,</p>
<p>but I will fluctuate between 95 to 105.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my standard deviation,</p>
<p>sort of a science dorks would call that.</p>
<p>If you start changing more than 5%</p>
<p>outside of your normal standard deviation,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m gonna start paying attention a little bit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna actually run a little bit of an algorithm</p>
<p>on this one.</p>
<p>And so here is my thinking process</p>
<p>when I get HRV, really any metric,</p>
<p>but HRV is the example we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>First step, did I collect good data?</p>
<p>And by that I mean, again,</p>
<p>did I measure it the same way I measured every single day</p>
<p>or did I get up and look at my phone first</p>
<p>and I realized, oh crap, I forgot to take my HRV</p>
<p>and then I went back and got there.</p>
<p>So say I had a 15% derivation from my normal number</p>
<p>and then I realized, oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>I was up super late last night doing whatever.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna consider that bad data.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s bad data, then I&rsquo;m not doing anything.</p>
<p>Ignore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad data.</p>
<p>You throw it out, you don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>If you decide for the most part,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume it was good data.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m going on to my next question,</p>
<p>which is, is it acute?</p>
<p>In other words, is it just today, right?</p>
<p>Or is it chronic?</p>
<p>And in other words,</p>
<p>is this pattern been happening for more than five days</p>
<p>or at least three out of the last four</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>Three minimum is what I like.</p>
<p>Honestly, I generally look at five or more days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very big distinction.</p>
<p>If it is something that just happened today,</p>
<p>then the next question I&rsquo;m gonna ask myself is,</p>
<p>am I in that adaptation phase?</p>
<p>Am I trying to be in a phase</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m trying to cause insults to the body</p>
<p>that it needs to respond with?</p>
<p>If that is the case, I&rsquo;m just gonna ignore it, right?</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s almost sometimes a good sign.</p>
<p>Hey, we are stressing the body and it is stressed.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re doing is working.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>In fact, if you don&rsquo;t see that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>hmm, maybe we&rsquo;re not doing enough to push the pace.</p>
<p>All right, so we&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>If the answer is no, we&rsquo;re in a peaking phase,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re actually gonna use</p>
<p>what I call acute state shifters.</p>
<p>So this is a whole host of little tricks that I have</p>
<p>that can change HRV or any recovery metric within seconds.</p>
<p>Again, these are not chronic fixes.</p>
<p>This is just, I&rsquo;m having a bad day today.</p>
<p>I feel like crap.</p>
<p>Can I make myself feel better right now?</p>
<p>And so I kind of call these parlor tricks a lot of the times</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a thousand of them.</p>
<p>We are certainly not gonna go over them,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you some examples.</p>
<p>You can pull out, first of all, physical movement.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned how just doing some yoga, moving around,</p>
<p>doing some jumping jacks, starting your workout.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve probably experienced this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of cliche in our world at this point,</p>
<p>but if you ever do any serious lifting</p>
<p>over a serious amount of time,</p>
<p>there will be days in which you walk in the gym</p>
<p>and you feel awful.</p>
<p>And somehow that day, you set a lifetime PR.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a strange, strange phenomena.</p>
<p>I experienced that more than a few times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>The inverse is rare, however.</p>
<p>You feel great, you have a horrible workout.</p>
<p>It happens and it can happen</p>
<p>for any number of different reasons.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think the former,</p>
<p>when one isn&rsquo;t feeling very good</p>
<p>and then somehow it&rsquo;s a terrific workout,</p>
<p>does set a kind of a seed of doubt</p>
<p>as to how good our subjective assessments really are,</p>
<p>which I guess is why we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>objective assessments like HRV.</p>
<p>And remember, if it&rsquo;s a single day here,</p>
<p>you can even do hard training.</p>
<p>People sort of have this idea like,</p>
<p>well, if you get up and your recovery score&rsquo;s down,</p>
<p>do a lighter day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably, I&rsquo;m probably never making that choice,</p>
<p>to be honest, not in this situation.</p>
<p>Remember, this is one bad day</p>
<p>and we are in a phase of even trying</p>
<p>to improve performance right now.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re probably still training hard.</p>
<p>You will, again, often see I felt terrible</p>
<p>when I trained super hard</p>
<p>and it totally changed my day around.</p>
<p>This all can happen.</p>
<p>So exercise is my first love here.</p>
<p>Absolutely breathing,</p>
<p>any sort of up-regulation breathing.</p>
<p>So we talked a lot about down-regulation breathing.</p>
<p>Just do the opposite, right?</p>
<p>And so this is when hyperventilation strategies can work.</p>
<p>Instead of accentuating the exhale,</p>
<p>you accentuate the inhale or you restrict the exhales.</p>
<p>This is working on the exact opposite situation.</p>
<p>You can also play little,</p>
<p>this is where things like music, motivational quotes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the type that follows people on Instagram</p>
<p>that motivates you or can work with these things.</p>
<p>Coaching tactics.</p>
<p>These can be things like finding out</p>
<p>or talking about that person&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>You sort of shared something that a mantra you use</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re training hard to keep you go better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna ask you to share that now,</p>
<p>but some people have this sometimes, right?</p>
<p>Or you may have this conversation with your athlete.</p>
<p>We call this finding out your why, right?</p>
<p>So finding out like, why are you really here?</p>
<p>What are we doing here?</p>
<p>And a lot of times you&rsquo;ll hear things</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s because I grew up poor</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t ever wanna be poor again.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Or this is for my children or like any number of things.</p>
<p>And you can pull that out on these days.</p>
<p>You need to be really careful.</p>
<p>This is why I call these parlor tricks.</p>
<p>Because when you play that card too often,</p>
<p>it starts to lose effect, right?</p>
<p>And you can only dig to a hole so often</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>the same thing as with music, right?</p>
<p>Every time you go to the weight room,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s blasting death metal at level 10.</p>
<p>Well, eventually it&rsquo;s no longer motivating, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer helpful.</p>
<p>So you wanna deploy these things strategically.</p>
<p>Yeah, the phrase that comes to mind is signal to noise.</p>
<p>You know, the nervous system,</p>
<p>especially the dopamine system and the adrenaline system,</p>
<p>which are a part of this larger system</p>
<p>called the catecholamine system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.</p>
<p>The get up and go focus on external goals,</p>
<p>movement associated and on and on.</p>
<p>That system responds best to high signal relative to noise.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re, as you pointed out,</p>
<p>listening to music every time,</p>
<p>drinking a ton of caffeine, energy drinks,</p>
<p>pre-workout, nootropics,</p>
<p>and then stacking all those things,</p>
<p>sometimes refer to this as dopamine stacking,</p>
<p>informally referred to as dopamine stacking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing all those things.</p>
<p>And then, first of all,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re wondering why later that afternoon</p>
<p>or the next day you&rsquo;re feeling like you&rsquo;re under a cloud.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s obvious your catecholamine system crashed.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also that you don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>become dependent on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that you start to wonder</p>
<p>whether or not you have the internal mechanisms</p>
<p>and motivation to train without those things.</p>
<p>And so one tends to use them more and more,</p>
<p>and then they have a diminishing effect over time.</p>
<p>The rule that I&rsquo;ve been sort of applying has been,</p>
<p>I never do two workouts in a row</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m stacking in stimulants, loud music,</p>
<p>and any kind of sort of high potency inspiration.</p>
<p>However, every set in the gym or when I run,</p>
<p>I really try and be diligent about form</p>
<p>and attention to what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>The one exception would be</p>
<p>the long duration endurance work.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I do that work</p>
<p>is to let my mind go into states of drifting,</p>
<p>not trying to think in complete sentences</p>
<p>or even close to it,</p>
<p>just let my brain kind of idle at a low hum.</p>
<p>And for that reason, generally listen to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more of a story or don&rsquo;t listen to anything at all</p>
<p>and just let my thoughts kind of spool through.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to take us too far off track,</p>
<p>but I think this idea of signal to noise</p>
<p>will resonate with the engineers out there.</p>
<p>But since most people are likely not engineers,</p>
<p>it is the way that the nervous system works,</p>
<p>evidenced by the fact that whatever area of your body</p>
<p>right now is in contact with a chair</p>
<p>or any other surface that it&rsquo;s been in contact with</p>
<p>for more than a few seconds,</p>
<p>you forget that it&rsquo;s in contact with it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s low signal to noise at that point.</p>
<p>A similar note,</p>
<p>you actually mentioned stimulants basically there,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re talking caffeine or any other stimulant,</p>
<p>any other cortisol modulators or adaptogens,</p>
<p>any of these things fall in the category.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not using them consistently</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having a rough day</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you throw down</p>
<p>200 milligrams of caffeine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to change real fast, the equation.</p>
<p>Strong performance enhancing effect.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And for these reasons, right?</p>
<p>So we mentioned a couple of them, breath work, food,</p>
<p>more calories, just eating some food.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;ll give people</p>
<p>what we call comfort foods.</p>
<p>So this is just like,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re from Georgia and we know you love grits.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re having grits for breakfast.</p>
<p>Oh my, great.</p>
<p>Like just something to change your mood,</p>
<p>acute state shifters to alter it.</p>
<p>The other couple of tricks here are light.</p>
<p>So if we know that maybe say</p>
<p>multiple people are struggling that day,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll put on the lights extra bright.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll bring in some extra things</p>
<p>and just get it more light in the area.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t even count actually going outside</p>
<p>and seeing the sun, but perhaps we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And then other little tricks</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve learned over the years</p>
<p>is one particular thing I love is literally drawing a line,</p>
<p>a physical line on the ground.</p>
<p>And you look at that line and you say like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to train today</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to accomplish this effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to walk past this line</p>
<p>and into that training space</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m ready to give that effort.</p>
<p>And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever,</p>
<p>but the physical barrier is very important to saying like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just going to get through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to actually perform the way I want to perform</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not going to do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to cross this line</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m ready to make that happen.</p>
<p>I really like that tool.</p>
<p>It also brings to mind the importance</p>
<p>of at least thinking about how your relationship</p>
<p>with your phone during training can perhaps help,</p>
<p>but also impede workout motivation and performance.</p>
<p>In an earlier episode,</p>
<p>you mentioned that if people are using their phone</p>
<p>to play music during their workout,</p>
<p>that they establish the complete playlist</p>
<p>prior to initiating the workout</p>
<p>and then not deviate from that playlist</p>
<p>as opposed to changing it in the middle</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just too much of an impulse</p>
<p>to also check social media, check email,</p>
<p>check text messages.</p>
<p>I mean, the way I think about the phone actually</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a bunch of little brain areas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a memory system for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got lookup tables for lookup tables.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got websites to look things up on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got photos.</p>
<p>It is so rich with sensory data</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so closely linked to our own brain architecture.</p>
<p>The algorithms are designed for those to be that way</p>
<p>that I always think about it</p>
<p>as bringing in a second person with me,</p>
<p>but that person is my twin</p>
<p>that has severe attention issues.</p>
<p>And for those that already have attention issues,</p>
<p>just think about this as a twin that would then compound you</p>
<p>by tapping on your shoulder,</p>
<p>talking to you all the time, interrupting you.</p>
<p>Somebody that you like a lot,</p>
<p>but that frankly is a little bit irritating</p>
<p>in that they&rsquo;re interrupting your ability to really show up</p>
<p>and also your ability to show up for them.</p>
<p>So I started to think about the phone as an entire individual</p>
<p>and that it represents me</p>
<p>and certainly not the better version of me.</p>
<p>Great, exactly.</p>
<p>You actually mentioned something else</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll use occasionally,</p>
<p>which what we call brain games or puzzles,</p>
<p>whether this is a crossword puzzle</p>
<p>or something where you actually lose</p>
<p>your thought of self for a second</p>
<p>and your brain gets engaged in a task</p>
<p>that you weren&rsquo;t regretting or even thinking about.</p>
<p>These can be stupid little games.</p>
<p>It could be little challenges,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re in like a group or a team setting.</p>
<p>All right, like we&rsquo;re going to play one round of dodgeball</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going to play one round of thumb wars.</p>
<p>So you do encourage this.</p>
<p>Yeah. I see.</p>
<p>So you would play like a thing instead of warming up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, get in and everyone get going.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get your foam roller, your dime,</p>
<p>or whatever thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, all right, everyone line up</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to play thumb wars to see who wins.</p>
<p>Just like whatever, right?</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve snapped into a new mental shift</p>
<p>or literally playing brain games,</p>
<p>playing Tetris on your phone,</p>
<p>like any of these things can work in this acute setting.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not directly related to recovery per se,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning or asking about rather,</p>
<p>which is the use of mirrors or no mirrors while training.</p>
<p>You know, the experience of seeing oneself</p>
<p>and observing one&rsquo;s form in the mirror,</p>
<p>I suppose has some utility.</p>
<p>You can get some sense of progress that you might trigger.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m almost specifically referring</p>
<p>to resistance training.</p>
<p>I suppose it could be cardio if you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>on a treadmill or pushing a sled or something,</p>
<p>but you can see form.</p>
<p>You can get a sense of what your face looks like</p>
<p>when you grimace, but in all seriousness,</p>
<p>you are without question a person, not you, Andy,</p>
<p>but one is in a less interoceptive mode</p>
<p>when looking at themselves in the mirror.</p>
<p>So the extra reception, perception of things</p>
<p>beyond the confines of our skin,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a picture of us,</p>
<p>interoception, perception of everything</p>
<p>from the skin inward.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re looking at ourselves,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re diverting some allocation of our attention.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a hundred, these are arbitrary units,</p>
<p>and you can put 50% of your attention</p>
<p>on the feeling in your body or the muscles you&rsquo;re training.</p>
<p>And 50% on how it appears in the mirror,</p>
<p>or it could be a hundred percent on the mirror,</p>
<p>a hundred percent internally,</p>
<p>which you best accomplish probably by closing your eyes.</p>
<p>So obviously there are constraints here,</p>
<p>certain movements you wouldn&rsquo;t want to close your eyes,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>In general, what are your thoughts on mirrors</p>
<p>or no mirrors for resistance training specifically?</p>
<p>It depends on the metric that you find most important.</p>
<p>And what I mean by this is if you&rsquo;re training</p>
<p>for say muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s emerging evidence that suggests</p>
<p>actually looking at yourself in the mirror</p>
<p>and even flexing in between sets</p>
<p>can actually be advantageous or can augment muscle gains.</p>
<p>Oh my, there&rsquo;s support for all the mirror flexors.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Not making fun of you.</p>
<p>I just, it is sort of interesting</p>
<p>to be on the observing side of that.</p>
<p>But hey, listen, results are what people are after.</p>
<p>Yeah, having said that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to enhance movement learning,</p>
<p>then it may be detrimental.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing an exercise that is explosive</p>
<p>and fast, it&rsquo;s probably not the best thing</p>
<p>to be looking into a mirror.</p>
<p>If you were to walk into any Olympic weightlifting arena</p>
<p>and you had any thoughts of using a mirror,</p>
<p>you would probably run out of the gym very quickly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see yourself in time to make an adjustment</p>
<p>with a movement that&rsquo;s happening that fast.</p>
<p>And also we&rsquo;ll do exactly what you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is it will remove your ability</p>
<p>to understand and feel the movement.</p>
<p>And so this is a big component to using technology</p>
<p>for exercise at all, is you have to make sure</p>
<p>that the end point is you understanding you</p>
<p>and your physiology more, not less.</p>
<p>When you outsource learning to technology,</p>
<p>and in this case, even if the technology is the mirror,</p>
<p>you remove your ability to gain</p>
<p>and truly understand that learning process.</p>
<p>So you need to be very, very careful,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re using a mirror</p>
<p>or whether you&rsquo;re using any number of apps</p>
<p>where you can record, say, a movement</p>
<p>and then watch it afterwards</p>
<p>and it will give you a breakdown</p>
<p>if your hand was in the right spot</p>
<p>or foot was in the right spot.</p>
<p>These are all great,</p>
<p>but you need to then take the next step,</p>
<p>which is to say, I need to be able to feel that position.</p>
<p>All right, so in the case of performance,</p>
<p>if you can imagine trying to learn a new technique,</p>
<p>say running technique,</p>
<p>and you have to be able to watch yourself in the mirror</p>
<p>to understand your stride in the right position.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t take the next step of saying,</p>
<p>okay, now I don&rsquo;t have to look in the mirror</p>
<p>and I can feel when I&rsquo;m getting out of rhythm</p>
<p>or whatever the case is,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll never be able to actually</p>
<p>then use that in your race.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very, very important that people, again,</p>
<p>pay attention to what is the dependent variable</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually interested in doing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to get better at something,</p>
<p>the tech is okay as a starting place.</p>
<p>It just cannot be the finishing place.</p>
<p>Thank you for those reflections.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to what happens</p>
<p>or what one should do if their HRV is reduced</p>
<p>for maybe three or four or more days in a row.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The next question that I&rsquo;m going to ask is,</p>
<p>again, am I in that adaptation phase?</p>
<p>If so, I&rsquo;m going to still ignore it</p>
<p>just like I did if it was a single bad day,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to start watching it very carefully.</p>
<p>I may actually now introduce some other tests.</p>
<p>So I may use a performance test.</p>
<p>We may look at something else, maybe ask questions,</p>
<p>maybe have some communication either with myself</p>
<p>or somebody else.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to start paying more attention,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still really not going to take much action</p>
<p>until that crosses more than seven days</p>
<p>of consistent problems.</p>
<p>If it does do that or we&rsquo;re in a peaking phase,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to go to another set of solutions</p>
<p>that are truly going to pull me out of the hole</p>
<p>rather than just be those acute state shifters.</p>
<p>These are more what I call chronic state shifters.</p>
<p>Now, some of these are actually very similar</p>
<p>to the ones we&rsquo;ve used before.</p>
<p>For example, thermal stress.</p>
<p>So I can promise you if your recovery score is in the tanks</p>
<p>and you walk outside and you jump in your 35 degree water</p>
<p>and you get back out,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is your HRV score</p>
<p>immediately afterwards, I&rsquo;m talking within seconds,</p>
<p>is going to be significantly compromised, right?</p>
<p>In other words, think about that.</p>
<p>Remember a low HRV means a high sympathetic.</p>
<p>I promise you cold water</p>
<p>will put you in a high sympathetic drive.</p>
<p>However, and we&rsquo;ve tested this pretty extensively,</p>
<p>looking at HRV zero, 15, 30, 60, 90,</p>
<p>all the way up to 180 minutes post.</p>
<p>And on average, you will see your HRV score</p>
<p>continue to rise after that.</p>
<p>And so while you have this immediate sympathetic response,</p>
<p>you will immediately then respond at about 30 minutes</p>
<p>on most people, depends on the person though,</p>
<p>and that score will be improved</p>
<p>for several hours afterwards.</p>
<p>So heat can kind of have a similar effect.</p>
<p>That actually, again, is sort of an acute fix,</p>
<p>but over time, as we&rsquo;ve described earlier,</p>
<p>that can also have a little bit of a chronic effect.</p>
<p>We can also then get into areas like sleep.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re going to start playing</p>
<p>and exploring why are you sleeping poor as well?</p>
<p>Or was your sleep score fine, but your HRV was low?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit of a different answer.</p>
<p>If your sleep is getting compromised,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re going to start going into</p>
<p>and making sure we&rsquo;re improving our sleep.</p>
<p>In terms of like brain stuff,</p>
<p>instead of maybe playing a game or having music</p>
<p>or some of these other tricks,</p>
<p>those aren&rsquo;t going to really have a chronic effect,</p>
<p>but you can do things like work on social connection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually been shown to improve recovery over time.</p>
<p>You can do things like journaling or meditation,</p>
<p>and those have an acute effect as well as a chronic effect.</p>
<p>So again, if you go journal right now,</p>
<p>you probably feel better,</p>
<p>but also we know that over time</p>
<p>that will gradually improve things.</p>
<p>So adaptogens and things like that</p>
<p>also can have a chronic effect.</p>
<p>So can things like electrolytes or food or hydration</p>
<p>if those things were off.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to go to a whole number of areas,</p>
<p>but those are the primary ones.</p>
<p>Outstanding of all that, of course,</p>
<p>it may be simply a time to go back</p>
<p>and reassess our training program.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s truly the case.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>If so, we&rsquo;re probably going to either</p>
<p>completely remove training</p>
<p>or drop it to like 50% or so</p>
<p>until we start rebounding back to baseline.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s generally the numbers we use.</p>
<p>For many people who are not training</p>
<p>for a competitive sport</p>
<p>and maybe aren&rsquo;t pushing themselves really hard,</p>
<p>maybe they consider themselves somebody who exercises</p>
<p>in order to maintain health and aesthetics</p>
<p>and longevity, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they never really finish any workout</p>
<p>completely exhausted.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sleeping okay.</p>
<p>Their appetite&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Can we assume that they are recovering well</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re not creating enough</p>
<p>of a adaptation response?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no progressive overreaching.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s really no stimulus for recovery.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying here is on the face of it,</p>
<p>I think is obvious, right?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t train hard, there&rsquo;s nothing to recover from.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really saying is,</p>
<p>is the ability to recover itself</p>
<p>something that we need to train?</p>
<p>In other words, can we get better at recovering?</p>
<p>And the analogy here would be something like focus.</p>
<p>In order to perform work of any kind,</p>
<p>but certainly mental work and physical work,</p>
<p>we need to be able to focus.</p>
<p>The ability to focus is the reflection</p>
<p>of a bunch of neural circuits</p>
<p>and chemicals and hormones, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we know roughly what those are.</p>
<p>And we know that if you are poor at focusing</p>
<p>for every small bit of time</p>
<p>that you can focus a little bit longer,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a matter of seconds,</p>
<p>those circuits themselves get better at focusing</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So in other words, is the recovery system,</p>
<p>however broad, neurotransmitters, hormones,</p>
<p>neural, muscular, immune-based, et cetera,</p>
<p>can that system or set of systems become better?</p>
<p>Can we get better at recovering?</p>
<p>Meaning, can it become faster and more effective?</p>
<p>Can we think of the recovery system</p>
<p>as kind of a blade that gets sharper by engaging recovery?</p>
<p>Because if so, then there&rsquo;s strong reason</p>
<p>for people who are not pushing really hard</p>
<p>to push at least a little bit harder</p>
<p>than is comfortable for them every once in a while</p>
<p>to make sure that that system doesn&rsquo;t start to slide back.</p>
<p>Remember, physiology is listening to everything you do</p>
<p>and it is always responding.</p>
<p>So the analogy that I will meet your analogy with</p>
<p>that I use here is the bowling alley.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve probably been bowling before</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve used the bumper lanes, right?</p>
<p>The bumper lanes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone bowling before and I&rsquo;ve spent time in the gutter</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve spent time on the pins.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>We used to have a bowling alley in the town where I went to</p>
<p>and it was fun.</p>
<p>We used to slide around on those shoes</p>
<p>and like all the kids would hang out there.</p>
<p>I feel like, do they still have bowling alleys?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>It feels like something that may have gone</p>
<p>the way of the mid 2000s.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if no one bills anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to ruin my good analogy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, my intent wasn&rsquo;t to ruin your analogy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Tell us about bowling.</p>
<p>All the bowlers are going to come after me</p>
<p>with bowling balls or something.</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;re going to get blasted</p>
<p>with all the stats on elevations.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hurt me.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So if one were to go bowling</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t want to put their ball in the gutter,</p>
<p>you could put these little bumpers in those lanes, right?</p>
<p>And these little foam pads that go in the gutter</p>
<p>that if your ball is going towards the gutter,</p>
<p>it hits those and bounces off</p>
<p>and goes back in the lane, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So in this entire conversation,</p>
<p>and this is actually true of a lot</p>
<p>of the way people approach their fitness and health,</p>
<p>people are very concerned oftentimes with optimizing,</p>
<p>meaning I want to make sure I don&rsquo;t go in the gutter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hit the walls.</p>
<p>So therefore I&rsquo;m going to try to improve the accuracy</p>
<p>in which I throw the ball.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that I&rsquo;m throwing it down</p>
<p>the center of the lane more often.</p>
<p>And I want to get my standard deviation tighter and tighter</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t get anywhere close to hitting the wall.</p>
<p>However, what they&rsquo;re not realizing is if you do that,</p>
<p>the body will start shrinking the size of the lane.</p>
<p>Because what it basically says is,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t had a ball touch us in years.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to be this wide.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get smaller and smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that you actually are having</p>
<p>a reduced ability to recover,</p>
<p>but you start becoming incredibly sensitive to that.</p>
<p>So your two strategies for enhancing recovery</p>
<p>are to practice getting closer,</p>
<p>throwing that ball down the middle lane,</p>
<p>or to widen, to widen the alley.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>And you absolutely should do that.</p>
<p>And so what happens is you don&rsquo;t have to be so precise</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re doing because your ability</p>
<p>to handle so many things is widened.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re off now by four or five inches to the right,</p>
<p>no problem because you&rsquo;ve just tripled</p>
<p>the size of your alley.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what you want to do.</p>
<p>So paying attention to two things.</p>
<p>Number one is getting better at accuracy,</p>
<p>maybe staying really tight with your progressions,</p>
<p>using nutrition and sleep to optimize your recovery</p>
<p>and push your resilience is what we call this.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s actually a biological way</p>
<p>to measure resilience.</p>
<p>We do that in all of our folks.</p>
<p>This is scientifically validated stuff.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t just make it up.</p>
<p>You can actually measure resilience.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more and more coming out on this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly what that term means.</p>
<p>So how well can you handle</p>
<p>and bang things off the threshold?</p>
<p>So when you see a reduction in say 10% of your HRV today,</p>
<p>for you, that may make you feel terrible.</p>
<p>For me, I might not feel anything</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m well adapted to large fluctuations</p>
<p>and therefore I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>The less and less you do that,</p>
<p>the more and more responsive you will be</p>
<p>to those slight deviations.</p>
<p>So that is exactly the target.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what I allude to when I say,</p>
<p>you got to understand what are we optimizing for?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re optimizing for making sure</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel any different today</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re optimizing to make sure when I do feel different,</p>
<p>I still am able to perform.</p>
<p>So this is why you want to do things</p>
<p>like maybe use some caffeine today and feel great.</p>
<p>But if I have to use it every day,</p>
<p>all I&rsquo;m doing is shrinking my sensitivity there.</p>
<p>If I have to go a day without it, I can&rsquo;t train at all.</p>
<p>Caffeine is the easy example</p>
<p>because people understand how that whole system works.</p>
<p>But this is really true of everything else.</p>
<p>So yeah, you need to practice this.</p>
<p>And the way to do that is to give yourself more stress.</p>
<p>To continue to bring in the stress from nutrition,</p>
<p>from training, from breath work.</p>
<p>You mentioned earlier about focus.</p>
<p>The exact same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about getting better right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about training a system.</p>
<p>And you can clearly train that, right?</p>
<p>We will often say breath work is a practice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re practicing getting better at these things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re practicing returning your focus.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re practicing recovering.</p>
<p>And quite literally physiologically,</p>
<p>you can up-regulate, whether we&rsquo;re talking enzymes,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about regulators,</p>
<p>these will be up-regulated.</p>
<p>So then the next time that insult comes in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as big as, it&rsquo;s not as damaging.</p>
<p>So yeah, absolutely you can, and you should strive for that.</p>
<p>Throughout all the episodes</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve been talking about exercise,</p>
<p>at the core of that is this word adaptations.</p>
<p>And I love that you mentioned</p>
<p>that breath work can also create adaptations.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;m visualizing all of this now</p>
<p>is that resistance training with weights,</p>
<p>machines, body weight, otherwise,</p>
<p>cardiovascular training, running, jogging,</p>
<p>sprinting, jumping, and so on.</p>
<p>Thermal training, exposure to heat,</p>
<p>exposure to cold in a dedicated way.</p>
<p>And deliberate respiration,</p>
<p>aka breathing or breath work as a practice.</p>
<p>All of those can be viewed as ways to trigger adaptations.</p>
<p>And in the context of recovery,</p>
<p>the specific adaptations you&rsquo;re trying to engage</p>
<p>are opposite to stress.</p>
<p>In fact, with the exception of perhaps</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure, maybe deliberate heat exposure,</p>
<p>because if the sauna is really hot,</p>
<p>you can get the dynorphin release,</p>
<p>which is kind of uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But still in both those cases, the rebound from that,</p>
<p>in other words, when you get out, you shower,</p>
<p>you go to bed, the next morning,</p>
<p>you do have this kind of blissed out feeling.</p>
<p>We know why that is.</p>
<p>That is the rebound to that uncomfortable situation.</p>
<p>So it seems it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re using resistance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing cardiovascular training,</p>
<p>using thermal approaches,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re using respiration-based approaches.</p>
<p>All of these are really ways of both triggering adaptations</p>
<p>and if applied properly,</p>
<p>to actually help you recover from the stress</p>
<p>and create the literal result</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>For some people, that might&rsquo;ve been obvious,</p>
<p>but I think for many people, including myself,</p>
<p>this set of conversations that we&rsquo;ve been having</p>
<p>over the series, these episodes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the first time that I&rsquo;ve ever thought</p>
<p>about exercise in these ways.</p>
<p>In any event, it&rsquo;s just a reflection,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one that at least for me is tremendously useful</p>
<p>because it has a lot of organizational logic to it,</p>
<p>which at least appeals to my brain</p>
<p>because the more that things have a logic,</p>
<p>the more for me that they become simplified</p>
<p>and the more that the vast array of tools</p>
<p>becomes visible to me.</p>
<p>As you said earlier, what is it?</p>
<p>Let me make sure I get this right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s concepts are few, methods are many?</p>
<p>Pretty close.</p>
<p>Okay, remind us how you state it.</p>
<p>Methods are many, concepts are few.</p>
<p>Ah, okay.</p>
<p>Either way.</p>
<p>The directionality probably matters.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s keep it right.</p>
<p>Methods are many, concepts are few.</p>
<p>Galpin&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>In science, you&rsquo;re not allowed to name things after yourself,</p>
<p>but you can name things after other people,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s Galpin&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m definitely the one who created that idea.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That was extreme and tremendous sarcasm</p>
<p>just so we&rsquo;re ultra clear.</p>
<p>Regardless, here we go, Galpin&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s in my head right now</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve thrown out a lot of options for folks</p>
<p>and maybe what we can do is try to simplify a little bit.</p>
<p>So what I can kind of walk you through</p>
<p>is how we measure recovery, if you will,</p>
<p>and how often and some tools.</p>
<p>And what I would recommend people do</p>
<p>is not use everything I said.</p>
<p>You want to pick one or two things per category</p>
<p>that are most important to you,</p>
<p>that are at your cost, that are at your availability,</p>
<p>that are interesting and important and relevant to you,</p>
<p>and do that.</p>
<p>The reason I kind of wanted to cover</p>
<p>a large number of things was to give folks options,</p>
<p>but again, I want to emphasize</p>
<p>the point is to not measure all of them.</p>
<p>In fact, you don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ran this before with professional athletes</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve taken blood, urine, every single day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done performance measures,</p>
<p>vertical jumps on a force plate,</p>
<p>a whole bunch of things every day for years on end.</p>
<p>And what I can tell you is</p>
<p>there is tremendous redundancy in physiology, right?</p>
<p>Everything is everything.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to do them</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re missing out</p>
<p>if you aren&rsquo;t doing them.</p>
<p>One or two metrics is probably fine.</p>
<p>I generally recommend one subjective measure.</p>
<p>This could be as simple as what&rsquo;s your mood?</p>
<p>How do you feel today?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And one objective measure,</p>
<p>HRV, resting heart rate, anything else, right?</p>
<p>So if you even literally just did that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably have pretty good insight</p>
<p>as to what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So maybe in fact, I&rsquo;ll go more detail here.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of examples</p>
<p>of things to measure every day.</p>
<p>Some things that you should measure</p>
<p>maybe quarterly, monthly,</p>
<p>and then maybe even semi-annually.</p>
<p>And then you can maybe just pick a couple</p>
<p>from each of these categories</p>
<p>and have yourself a pretty good monitoring system</p>
<p>for what to do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll include some that are</p>
<p>a little bit of technology-based</p>
<p>and then others that are totally cost-free</p>
<p>and require nothing.</p>
<p>Okay, to start off,</p>
<p>I would recommend taking something like HRV every day</p>
<p>or most days.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a device like that,</p>
<p>you could also use, honestly, the CO2 tolerance test.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about that a number of times</p>
<p>and we probably have plenty of research to go find that.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t require anything.</p>
<p>It typically takes about a minute or so.</p>
<p>And you can do that under the same circumstances</p>
<p>in which HRV.</p>
<p>In other words, do it the same time every day,</p>
<p>have the same standardization stuff.</p>
<p>And that is actually been in our coaching experience.</p>
<p>While admittedly,</p>
<p>there is no peer-reviewed research on this yet.</p>
<p>Just in our experience,</p>
<p>this tends to track extremely closely with HRV</p>
<p>and other metrics of recovery.</p>
<p>In fact, we actually did do a pilot trial in my lab</p>
<p>and it tracked decently well</p>
<p>with both state and trade anxiety.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a nice metric.</p>
<p>Not perfect, but you could take that.</p>
<p>So if you wanted, you could do both.</p>
<p>But again, remember,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to capture systemic stress.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re really just showing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re measuring one thing two ways.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to have them both.</p>
<p>I will do both just because I&rsquo;m super interested</p>
<p>in small differences.</p>
<p>But globally, they&rsquo;re going to tell you</p>
<p>basically the same thing.</p>
<p>So those are two things where we use,</p>
<p>again, basically daily, year-round, or close to it.</p>
<p>If you want to go past that a little bit,</p>
<p>you can use a pretty old,</p>
<p>commonly used survey called a DALDA, D-A-L-D-A.</p>
<p>I forget the exact acronym,</p>
<p>but it is a fairly lengthy questionnaire.</p>
<p>And it accounts for things like how do you feel today?</p>
<p>How did you sleep?</p>
<p>Any stressors going on in your life?</p>
<p>How you&rsquo;ve been eating?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this fairly comprehensive, lengthy survey</p>
<p>that came out, I mean, jeez, it&rsquo;s probably been around</p>
<p>for 30 years or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing new and been used extensively.</p>
<p>You would not want to do that every day.</p>
<p>If you wanted to take some subjective measures every day,</p>
<p>we typically stick with, like I said,</p>
<p>mood, motivation, something like that.</p>
<p>You could perform this DALDA test</p>
<p>so something more like monthly,</p>
<p>or at the end of each training phase,</p>
<p>every couple of months, and probably worth looking at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to tell you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a bad spot today or tomorrow,</p>
<p>but you would pick that up</p>
<p>with the HRV or SUTU tolerance test.</p>
<p>It would, though, tell you information,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re working with another individual,</p>
<p>about major life changes.</p>
<p>And if anything, it just facilitates that conversation.</p>
<p>I noticed you reported X happening.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that and can I help, et cetera.</p>
<p>So another kind of sneaky, helpful one</p>
<p>is this is simply body fat.</p>
<p>Like I said, non-functional overreaching</p>
<p>and overtraining are associated with a number of things</p>
<p>like energy, appetite suppression,</p>
<p>changes in body weight or body composition.</p>
<p>So you can measure that monthly or even really quarterly,</p>
<p>depending on what kind of athlete</p>
<p>or individual you&rsquo;re working at,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not trying to lose weight</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re trying to be at maintenance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll give you some insights as well.</p>
<p>So moving past that now,</p>
<p>actually we&rsquo;re going to move into the realm of things</p>
<p>that we call hidden stressors.</p>
<p>So those are all visible stressors.</p>
<p>So hidden stressors,</p>
<p>the most common ones we&rsquo;ve sort of mentioned,</p>
<p>and I would probably do this.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re going to have to do these ones through serum.</p>
<p>So this is blood work.</p>
<p>Cortisol, like we talked about, and testosterone,</p>
<p>then of course, testosterone to cortisol ratio.</p>
<p>And then the other ones I mentioned.</p>
<p>You can do those quarterly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad.</p>
<p>There are some blood markers</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s really no sense to do them that soon.</p>
<p>And there are other markers.</p>
<p>I mean, in our system,</p>
<p>our individuals are getting pretty extensive blood work,</p>
<p>saliva work, urine, and stool.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s plenty of those things</p>
<p>you just do not need to measure every 10 weeks or so.</p>
<p>In this case, cortisol, as you know, sort of changes rapidly.</p>
<p>Testosterone can change pretty quickly.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re really trying to notice a large trend,</p>
<p>certainly a quarterly or so is an appropriate timeframe.</p>
<p>Doing it every four or five weeks is probably unnecessary.</p>
<p>So you can save yourself some money and do that.</p>
<p>Other stuff you can look at,</p>
<p>actually more like semi-annually in plasma,</p>
<p>like glutamine and glutamine to glutamate ratio.</p>
<p>And you can maybe save the why</p>
<p>you wanna look at those for another conversation.</p>
<p>But those are important.</p>
<p>We always look at something from the oxidative stress thing.</p>
<p>So this could be something like TNF-alpha</p>
<p>or interleukin-6, something like that.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re looking at that in serum</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking at that semi-annually.</p>
<p>And then another sneaky, actually,</p>
<p>one that I love to look at</p>
<p>is the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio,</p>
<p>which will give you some pretty good insight.</p>
<p>And again, you could look at that like fairly quarterly.</p>
<p>If that number starts to get really high,</p>
<p>certainly like more than nine to one,</p>
<p>you got a pretty good insight</p>
<p>that something gnarly is going on at the immune system.</p>
<p>So we will actually take action</p>
<p>much lower than that number,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like a nice cutoff you&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a very, very high number.</p>
<p>So those are some things you can use.</p>
<p>Most folks have the ability, hopefully,</p>
<p>to get some basic blood work done,</p>
<p>get a basic what&rsquo;s called a CBC and CMP.</p>
<p>If you have a great physician</p>
<p>and you can get insurance to cover that</p>
<p>and you just go on and ask for a CBC and CMP,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll know what that means.</p>
<p>You can Google that and they&rsquo;ll order it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get all the information typically</p>
<p>that I just described or close enough</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get some insights.</p>
<p>And then again, you can just use</p>
<p>that free service I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>to check to see whether or not the changes</p>
<p>are just a matter of testing quality</p>
<p>or actually physiologically relevant.</p>
<p>What you just described</p>
<p>is an amazingly powerful array of tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that you can also mention a few tools</p>
<p>that are either lower cost, truly low cost,</p>
<p>or zero cost that while they may not have the accuracy</p>
<p>or give the complete picture that some of the biomarkers</p>
<p>and other tools that you mentioned do,</p>
<p>that they can still provide reasonably reliable metrics</p>
<p>that people can use in order to assess</p>
<p>their level of recovery.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The CO2 tolerance test would be the first one.</p>
<p>And you can just take that metric anytime you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>The other ones we&rsquo;ve talked about so far</p>
<p>are things like your mood.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t mentioned libido,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s another assessment</p>
<p>that people also tend to have a pretty good grip on</p>
<p>and they know what feels normal.</p>
<p>So when things go out of whack,</p>
<p>it tends to be a pretty good signal</p>
<p>that people will recognize.</p>
<p>Yeah, and one note about that,</p>
<p>something that came up in an episode on hormones,</p>
<p>both for male and female health,</p>
<p>that at some point it will air,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s no objective measure</p>
<p>for people in terms of libido across the board,</p>
<p>meaning people vary tremendously,</p>
<p>age, life circumstances, and on and on.</p>
<p>And so this is one of those subjective measures</p>
<p>that I think people need to have some sense</p>
<p>of what their quote unquote baseline really is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing that the time to assess that</p>
<p>might best be when initiating or midway</p>
<p>through a relatively low intensity training phase,</p>
<p>maybe during the time of year</p>
<p>in which all the other factors that can influence libido</p>
<p>are not at their maximum.</p>
<p>So if you think about light and dopamine</p>
<p>and the relationship between those</p>
<p>and the testosterone and estrogen systems,</p>
<p>we know that libido, testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in men and women tends to peak in the summer months.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s your baseline that you&rsquo;re comparing to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s as reliable</p>
<p>as picking something like the fall or the spring.</p>
<p>And so anyway, this again is very subjective,</p>
<p>but we just encourage people to recognize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no standard numbers for this,</p>
<p>no lookup table,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no equivalent of the libido BMI, the LMI,</p>
<p>no disrespect to the acronym that probably is LMI.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s just something to keep in mind</p>
<p>as people do comparisons or subjective comparisons</p>
<p>is don&rsquo;t pick a comparison to an extreme,</p>
<p>try and pick a comparison to average as you know it to be.</p>
<p>That actually is sort of reminding me</p>
<p>one issue that we have seen a lot lately</p>
<p>is people, if they&rsquo;re having libido issues</p>
<p>or just even slightly noticing a drop,</p>
<p>they just assume that then therefore</p>
<p>it means their testosterone is crashing.</p>
<p>And those things are certainly connected,</p>
<p>but that is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>And where that becomes a problem</p>
<p>is then people then go on things like TRT, et cetera,</p>
<p>with no true oversight and then all kinds of other problems.</p>
<p>So make sure that if you&rsquo;re gonna take that step</p>
<p>that you actually get testosterone measured</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working with a qualified person</p>
<p>to guide you through that process,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just assume because you&rsquo;re having low energy</p>
<p>or your libido is a little bit down.</p>
<p>It could be simply training related.</p>
<p>It could be sleep related,</p>
<p>it could be any number of things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a little bit of a word of caution there.</p>
<p>Two quick points along the lines of what you just said.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that I learned</p>
<p>when researching our episode</p>
<p>on testosterone and estrogen optimization,</p>
<p>this was an episode that we&rsquo;d done some time ago</p>
<p>but is still available on our hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>all formats, et cetera,</p>
<p>is that many people actually increase their libido</p>
<p>and even their levels of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>as they progress from their 20s into their 40s</p>
<p>if they take excellent care of themselves,</p>
<p>including the correct exercise adaptations,</p>
<p>correct body fat to lean muscle ratios.</p>
<p>But of course it can go the other way too.</p>
<p>A lot of people can be training</p>
<p>to achieve such low body fat stores that libido can suffer.</p>
<p>So the age-related declines in libido</p>
<p>are not necessarily written into the script of life.</p>
<p>In fact, there are some data points</p>
<p>from a really interesting paper</p>
<p>I talk about in that episode of individuals.</p>
<p>This was a study focused on males in their 80s and 90s</p>
<p>who maintained total and free testosterone</p>
<p>as high as individuals in their 20s.</p>
<p>But then when you look at the lifestyle factors</p>
<p>of those people in their 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>they were doing a lot to create that scenario.</p>
<p>The second point is one related to what you just said,</p>
<p>which is very true,</p>
<p>which is people generally tend to assume</p>
<p>that a drop in libido is related to a drop in testosterone</p>
<p>and then assume that they need to increase their testosterone.</p>
<p>And in some cases that is true,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also often the case</p>
<p>that people who take estrogen or aromatase blockers,</p>
<p>that is enzyme inhibitors</p>
<p>that prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen,</p>
<p>experience severe deficits in libido</p>
<p>because of estrogen being too low.</p>
<p>So estrogen blockers are as much an issue here</p>
<p>as low testosterone.</p>
<p>And then the final point is also one that many people now,</p>
<p>men and women are, I think need to be aware of,</p>
<p>which is that dihydrotestosterone, DHT,</p>
<p>is among the more powerful androgens for power output,</p>
<p>physical power output, but also for libido.</p>
<p>And DHT is strongly inhibited by certain things like turmeric.</p>
<p>So a lot of people who are taking high doses of turmeric</p>
<p>can experience drops in libido.</p>
<p>And who are taking various compounds to prevent hair loss,</p>
<p>things like finasteride.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole catalog of things that can reduce libido</p>
<p>that are not directly in the testosterone pathway</p>
<p>that can be DHT-related or estrogen-related.</p>
<p>And this, I think, points to the importance of,</p>
<p>yes, take a subjective measure of your libido,</p>
<p>pay attention, essentially be aware, don&rsquo;t obsess,</p>
<p>but be aware and try and figure out</p>
<p>what factors are involved for you.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t immediately assume that what&rsquo;s needed</p>
<p>is more testosterone,</p>
<p>and oftentimes the opposite is the case.</p>
<p>Yeah, try to put on a lot of muscle with no estrogen.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Right, and indeed, a lot of athletes in particular,</p>
<p>competitive bodybuilders that have that</p>
<p>saran wrap thin skin,</p>
<p>if you get to know some of those people</p>
<p>and you talk to them,</p>
<p>they can look like the sort of comic book archetype</p>
<p>of what someone might want to be.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not what this discussion</p>
<p>or these episodes have been about,</p>
<p>but oftentimes they can have serious libido issues.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier, and I will emphasize it once more,</p>
<p>you need to be very cautious</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re taking antioxidants, anti-inflammatories,</p>
<p>cortisol reducers, for all those reasons, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really sort of get any examples,</p>
<p>but you just nailed another fantastic reason of it.</p>
<p>We do not give those things prophylactically.</p>
<p>I strongly discourage people from just walking around,</p>
<p>taking supplementation of antioxidants,</p>
<p>especially powerful ones, for no reason.</p>
<p>If you have done some testing</p>
<p>and you have a good reason to do so, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re in a very specific, say, training phase</p>
<p>or something like that, cool.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just walking around doing that,</p>
<p>you are oftentimes, not always,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re oftentimes causing problems</p>
<p>that then you then try to solve</p>
<p>by taking more of those anti-inflammatories.</p>
<p>I feel terrible, low energy, low libido,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I&rsquo;m too inflamed, et cetera.</p>
<p>So yeah, antioxidants in the form of food are fantastic.</p>
<p>Almost no issue.</p>
<p>There is good evidence actually there.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t worry about, man,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t eat high antioxidant-rich foods.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be fine.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is pharmaceuticals and supplementation,</p>
<p>where you can take orders of magnitude higher dosages</p>
<p>very quickly than you could in the presence of food.</p>
<p>So that distinction is also very important.</p>
<p>Antioxidant-rich foods are generally fine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s consumed in totally absurd concentrations.</p>
<p>Supplementations, powders, creams, drugs, et cetera,</p>
<p>is where you can get into problems.</p>
<p>So yeah, you wanna be very careful of doing that</p>
<p>unless you have a reason.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that unless we see a reason to do so</p>
<p>in someone&rsquo;s markers.</p>
<p>Yeah, and herbal compounds,</p>
<p>despite the fact that they&rsquo;re herbal,</p>
<p>can be quite potent modulators of hormones.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha being an example.</p>
<p>Two herbal compounds that we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about</p>
<p>on our podcast before and repeatedly,</p>
<p>including in that testosterone,</p>
<p>estrogen optimization episode,</p>
<p>tonga ali and phytogea agrestis.</p>
<p>Tonga ali is now taken by a large number of men and women.</p>
<p>Tonga ali and phytogea, typically men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that there are any good studies</p>
<p>about the effects of phytogea in women.</p>
<p>Those are herbal compounds that can have potent effects</p>
<p>in increasing testosterone and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Do they work?</p>
<p>Yeah, they work to varying degrees in most everybody,</p>
<p>certainly not in everybody, but they do work.</p>
<p>But they work because they&rsquo;re potent, they have effects.</p>
<p>So the idea that herbal compounds are not powerful is wrong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to remember that that can cut both ways.</p>
<p>Hence my mention of this observation related to turmeric,</p>
<p>which is not to say that some people can&rsquo;t take turmeric</p>
<p>and feel perfectly fine,</p>
<p>maintain or even increase their libido.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that can happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that for people that are very DHT sensitive,</p>
<p>this tends to be an issue.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, for many of these compounds,</p>
<p>the only way to find out is really to try them</p>
<p>or to just completely avoid them and decide.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna try them, it&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>But there really aren&rsquo;t ways to predict who will respond,</p>
<p>who won&rsquo;t, and who will be hyper responders.</p>
<p>And in that case, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a Wild West.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also sort of remembering</p>
<p>what the point of this conversation was supposed to be.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;ll return back to that,</p>
<p>which were some cost free or low cost metrics.</p>
<p>That was a very fun tangent.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, another couple of ones you can do</p>
<p>are grip strength testing.</p>
<p>So if you can buy a fairly cheap hand grip dynamometer</p>
<p>on any number of places,</p>
<p>these are typically able to be purchased for 20 to $40</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You can actually just test that every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that in a number of athletes</p>
<p>for a decent amount of time.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I don&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because I disagree with it,</p>
<p>but because we&rsquo;re getting the information already</p>
<p>and it was just too redundant.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the only option, it is a great one to do.</p>
<p>I mentioned also earlier how I actually like speed tests</p>
<p>over strength tests as an earlier indication</p>
<p>of overreaching.</p>
<p>And so because of that, I like a vertical jump test.</p>
<p>If you have access to a force plate, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And then you can get more in-depth characteristics</p>
<p>of the force velocity curve</p>
<p>and acceleration and things like that.</p>
<p>Used a lot in high performance situations.</p>
<p>If not, simply looking at your performance.</p>
<p>And so you can kind of go back</p>
<p>to one of our earlier episodes</p>
<p>when I described coloring my fingertips</p>
<p>with highlighters earlier in my life.</p>
<p>You could do the same thing and go out in your garage</p>
<p>and every day jump up and touch that marker</p>
<p>and see where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>So a system like that could be done.</p>
<p>You can also use tools like a force transducer</p>
<p>and do a standard movement.</p>
<p>I can say a vertical jump or a high pole</p>
<p>or something like that and measure the velocity</p>
<p>and just compare that day to day of a standard load.</p>
<p>So you do it every single time with the same load.</p>
<p>Same similar thing could be done</p>
<p>with like a medicine ball throw.</p>
<p>So you have the same ball, you throw the same thing</p>
<p>and this is sort of where you&rsquo;re at today.</p>
<p>You wanna do a little bit of warmup,</p>
<p>but not excessive here.</p>
<p>You wanna kind of get an idea of where your baseline is</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna influence it by the veracity</p>
<p>of the warmup every single day</p>
<p>because that alone can change it.</p>
<p>Same thing with stretching.</p>
<p>Acute static stretching</p>
<p>directly influences power production.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t wanna go out there</p>
<p>and one day do a 20 minute stretch before</p>
<p>and then the other day you didn&rsquo;t stretch at all</p>
<p>because that alone will cause deviations</p>
<p>in your performance.</p>
<p>Try to keep everything you can think of standardized</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;ll give you a little bit better data.</p>
<p>Remembering all of these values,</p>
<p>the biomarkers, the performance stuff,</p>
<p>they have normal variations.</p>
<p>You just wanna figure out first and foremost</p>
<p>what those normal variations are for you.</p>
<p>So you have your normal number,</p>
<p>you have your standard deviation.</p>
<p>When you start getting outside of that standard deviation,</p>
<p>you start paying attention.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of like what we typically call that</p>
<p>the gray zone.</p>
<p>And so if it&rsquo;s in the gray zone, we&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s outside of that, whatever that is for you,</p>
<p>recognizing that the gray zone is smaller for some folks</p>
<p>and larger for others,</p>
<p>but what is normal for you and your situation.</p>
<p>And then you can make your decisions outside of that</p>
<p>when you see numbers that are consistently</p>
<p>or more than three to five days in a row or close</p>
<p>for the last five days,</p>
<p>for the last six, something like that.</p>
<p>Then you may have some cause for action.</p>
<p>Well, that was an incredible description</p>
<p>of the various tools and modes for recovery.</p>
<p>And I realized I jumped the gun a bit</p>
<p>during our discussion about food and supplements,</p>
<p>but I like to think that it serves as a nice precursor</p>
<p>to the next episode,</p>
<p>which is going to be all about nutrition</p>
<p>and supplementation.</p>
