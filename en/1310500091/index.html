    <p>The following is a conversation with Jack Dorsey,</p>
<p>co founder and CEO of Twitter</p>
<p>and founder and CEO of Square.</p>
<p>Given the happenings at the time related to Twitter leadership</p>
<p>and the very limited time we had,</p>
<p>we decided to focus this conversation on Square</p>
<p>and some broader philosophical topics</p>
<p>and to save an in depth conversation</p>
<p>on engineering and AI at Twitter</p>
<p>for a second appearance in this podcast.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded</p>
<p>before the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For everyone feeling the medical, psychological</p>
<p>and financial burden of this crisis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sending love your way.</p>
<p>Stay strong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll beat this thing.</p>
<p>As an aside, let me mention</p>
<p>that Jack moved $1 billion of Square equity,</p>
<p>which is 28% of his wealth</p>
<p>to form an organization that funds COVID 19 relief.</p>
<p>First, as Andrew Yang tweeted,</p>
<p>this is a spectacular commitment.</p>
<p>And second, it is amazing that it operates transparently</p>
<p>by posting all its donations to a single Google doc.</p>
<p>To me, true transparency is simple.</p>
<p>And this is as simple as it gets.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>When I first heard about Masterclass,</p>
<p>I thought it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>For $180 a year,</p>
<p>you get an all access pass to watch courses from,</p>
<p>to list some of my favorites,</p>
<p>Chris Hadfield on space exploration,</p>
<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson on scientific thinking</p>
<p>and communication,</p>
<p>Will Wright, creator of SimCity and Sims,</p>
<p>both one of my favorite games on game design,</p>
<p>Jane Goodall on conservation,</p>
<p>Carlos Santana on guitar,</p>
<p>one of my favorite guitar players,</p>
<p>Gary Kasparov on chess,</p>
<p>Daniel Nagrano on poker and many, many more.</p>
<p>Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work</p>
<p>and the experience of being launched into space alone</p>
<p>is worth the money.</p>
<p>For me, the key is to not be overwhelmed</p>
<p>by the abundance of choice.</p>
<p>Pick three courses you want to complete,</p>
<p>watch each all the way through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that long,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an experience that will stick with you</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easily worth the money.</p>
<p>You can watch it on basically any device.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been on several podcasts,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, Rach Roll, others,</p>
<p>excellent conversations,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s several topics</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t talk about that I think are fascinating</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about,</p>
<p>sort of machine learning, artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>both the narrow kind and the general kind</p>
<p>and engineering at scale.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of incredible engineering going on</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a part of,</p>
<p>crypto, cryptocurrency, blockchain, UBI,</p>
<p>all kinds of philosophical questions maybe we&rsquo;ll get to</p>
<p>about life and death and meaning and beauty.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re involved in building some of</p>
<p>the biggest network systems in the world,</p>
<p>sort of trillions of interactions a day.</p>
<p>The cool thing about that is the infrastructure,</p>
<p>the engineering at scale.</p>
<p>You started as a programmer with C building.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a hacker, I&rsquo;m not really an engineer.</p>
<p>Not a legit software engineer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a hacker at heart.</p>
<p>But to achieve scale, you have to do some,</p>
<p>unfortunately, legit large scale engineering.</p>
<p>So how do you make that magic happen?</p>
<p>Hire people that I can learn from, number one.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a hacker in the sense that I,</p>
<p>my approach has always been do whatever it takes</p>
<p>to make it work.</p>
<p>So that I can see and feel the thing</p>
<p>and then learn what needs to come next.</p>
<p>And oftentimes what needs to come next is</p>
<p>a matter of being able to bring it to more people,</p>
<p>which is scale.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of great people out there</p>
<p>that either have experience or are extremely fast learners</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to find</p>
<p>and work with for years.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of it,</p>
<p>we benefit a ton from the open source community</p>
<p>and just all the learnings there</p>
<p>that are laid bare in the open.</p>
<p>All the mistakes, all the success,</p>
<p>all the problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very slow moving process usually open source,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very deliberate.</p>
<p>And you get to see because of the pace,</p>
<p>you get to see what it takes</p>
<p>to really build something meaningful.</p>
<p>So I learned most of everything I learned about hacking</p>
<p>and programming and engineering has been due to open source</p>
<p>and the generosity that people have given</p>
<p>to give up their time, sacrifice their time</p>
<p>without any expectation in return,</p>
<p>other than being a part of something</p>
<p>much larger than themselves, which I think is great.</p>
<p>Open source movement is amazing.</p>
<p>But if you just look at the scale,</p>
<p>like Square has to take care of,</p>
<p>is this fundamentally a software problem</p>
<p>or a hardware problem?</p>
<p>You mentioned hiring a bunch of people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, maybe from my perspective,</p>
<p>not often talked about how incredible that is</p>
<p>to sort of have a system that doesn&rsquo;t go down often,</p>
<p>that is secure, is able to take care</p>
<p>of all these transactions.</p>
<p>Like maybe I&rsquo;m also a hacker at heart</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s incredible to me that that kind of scale</p>
<p>could be achieved.</p>
<p>Is there some insight, some lessons,</p>
<p>some interesting tidbits that you can say</p>
<p>how to make that scale happen?</p>
<p>Is it the hardware fundamentally challenge?</p>
<p>Is it a software challenge?</p>
<p>Is it a social challenge of building large teams</p>
<p>of engineers that work together, that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the interesting challenges there?</p>
<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re the best dressed hacker I&rsquo;ve met.</p>
<p>I think the. Thank you.</p>
<p>If the enumeration you just went through,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>You have to kind of focus on all</p>
<p>and the ability to focus on all that</p>
<p>really comes down to how you face problems</p>
<p>and whether you can break them down into parts</p>
<p>that you can focus on.</p>
<p>Because I think the biggest mistake is trying to solve</p>
<p>or address too many at once</p>
<p>or not going deep enough with the questions</p>
<p>or not being critical of the answers you find</p>
<p>or not taking the time to form credible hypotheses</p>
<p>that you can actually test and you can see the results of.</p>
<p>So all of those fall in the face of ultimately</p>
<p>critical thinking skills, problem solving skills.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s one skill I want to improve every day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s what contributes to the learning</p>
<p>and the only way we can evolve any of these things</p>
<p>is learning what it&rsquo;s currently doing</p>
<p>and how to take it to the next step.</p>
<p>And questioning assumptions,</p>
<p>the first principles kind of thinking,</p>
<p>seems like a fundamental to this whole process.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if you get too overextended into,</p>
<p>well, this is a hardware issue,</p>
<p>you miss all the software solutions.</p>
<p>And vice versa, if you focus too much on the software,</p>
<p>there are hardware solutions that can 10X the thing.</p>
<p>So I try to resist the categories of thinking</p>
<p>and look for the underlying systems</p>
<p>that make all these things work.</p>
<p>But those only emerge when you have a skill</p>
<p>around creative thinking, problem solving,</p>
<p>and being able to ask critical questions</p>
<p>and having the patience to go deep.</p>
<p>So one of the amazing things,</p>
<p>if we look at the mission of Square,</p>
<p>is to increase people&rsquo;s access to the economy.</p>
<p>Maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s from my perspective.</p>
<p>So from the perspective of merchants,</p>
<p>peer to peer payments, even crypto, cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>digital cryptocurrency, what do you see as the major ways</p>
<p>that our society can increase participation in the economy?</p>
<p>So if we look at today and the next 10 years,</p>
<p>next 20 years, you go into Africa, maybe in Africa</p>
<p>and all kinds of other places outside of the North America.</p>
<p>If there was one word that I think represents</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to do at Square, it is that word access.</p>
<p>One of the things we found is that</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t expecting this at all.</p>
<p>When we started, we thought we were just building</p>
<p>a piece of hardware to enable people</p>
<p>to plug it into their phone and swipe a credit card.</p>
<p>And then as we talked with people</p>
<p>who actually tried to accept credit cards in the past,</p>
<p>we found a consistent theme, which many of them</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t even enabled, not enabled,</p>
<p>but allowed to process credit cards.</p>
<p>And we dug a little bit deeper, again, asking that question.</p>
<p>And we found that a lot of them would go to banks</p>
<p>or these merchant acquirers.</p>
<p>And waiting for them was a credit check</p>
<p>and looking at a FICA score.</p>
<p>And many of the businesses that we talked to</p>
<p>and many small businesses,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have good credit or a credit history.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re entrepreneurs who are just getting started,</p>
<p>taking a lot of personal risk, financial risk.</p>
<p>And it just felt ridiculous to us</p>
<p>that for the job of being able to accept money from people,</p>
<p>you had to get your credit checked.</p>
<p>And as we dug deeper, we realized that</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t the intention of the financial industry,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the only tool they had available to them</p>
<p>to understand authenticity, intent,</p>
<p>predictor of future behavior.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing we actually looked at.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the, you know, we built the hardware,</p>
<p>but the software really came in terms of risk modeling.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we started down the path</p>
<p>that eventually leads to AI.</p>
<p>We started with a very strong data science discipline</p>
<p>because we knew that our business</p>
<p>was not necessarily about making hardware.</p>
<p>It was more about enabling more people</p>
<p>to come into the system.</p>
<p>So the fundamental challenge there is,</p>
<p>so to enable more people to come into the system,</p>
<p>you have to lower the barrier of checking</p>
<p>that that person will be a legitimate vendor.</p>
<p>Is that the fundamental problem?</p>
<p>Yeah, and a different mindset.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset</p>
<p>of kind of distrust and just constantly looking</p>
<p>for opportunities to prove why people shouldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>into the system, whereas we took on a mindset of trust</p>
<p>and then verify, verify, verify, verify, verify.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So we moved, you know, when we entered the space,</p>
<p>only about 30 to 40% of the people who applied</p>
<p>to accept credit cards would actually get through the system.</p>
<p>We took that knowledge, we took it to the next level.</p>
<p>If we applied to accept credit cards,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d actually get through the system.</p>
<p>We took that number to 99%.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we reframed the problem,</p>
<p>we built credible models, and we had this mindset of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to watch not at the merchant level,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna watch at the transaction level.</p>
<p>So come in, perform some transactions,</p>
<p>and as long as you&rsquo;re doing things</p>
<p>with integrity, credible, and don&rsquo;t look suspicious,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll continue to serve you.</p>
<p>If we see any interestingness in how you use our system,</p>
<p>that will be bubbled up to people to review,</p>
<p>to figure out if there&rsquo;s something nefarious going on,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when we might ask you to leave.</p>
<p>So the change in the mindset led to the technology</p>
<p>that we needed to enable more people to get through,</p>
<p>and to enable more people to access the system.</p>
<p>What role does machine learning play into that,</p>
<p>in that context of, you said,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s a beautiful shift.</p>
<p>Anytime you shift your viewpoint into seeing</p>
<p>that people are fundamentally good,</p>
<p>and then you just have to verify</p>
<p>and catch the ones who are not,</p>
<p>as opposed to assuming everybody&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>this is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So what role does the, to you,</p>
<p>throughout the history of the company,</p>
<p>has machine learning played in doing that verification?</p>
<p>It was immediate.</p>
<p>I mean, we weren&rsquo;t calling it machine learning,</p>
<p>but it was data science.</p>
<p>And then as the industry evolved,</p>
<p>machine learning became more of the nomenclature,</p>
<p>and as that evolved, it became more sophisticated</p>
<p>with deep learning, and as that continues to evolve,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be another thing.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all in the same vein.</p>
<p>But we built that discipline up</p>
<p>within the first year of the company,</p>
<p>because we also had, we had to partner with a bank,</p>
<p>we had to partner with Visa and MasterCard,</p>
<p>and we had to show that,</p>
<p>by bringing more people into the system,</p>
<p>that we could do so in a responsible way,</p>
<p>that would not compromise their systems,</p>
<p>and that they would trust us.</p>
<p>How do you convince this upstart company</p>
<p>with some cool machine learning tricks</p>
<p>is able to deliver on this trustworthy set of merchants?</p>
<p>We staged it out in tiers.</p>
<p>We had a bucket of 500 people using it,</p>
<p>and then we showed results,</p>
<p>and then 1,000, and then 10,000, then 50,000,</p>
<p>and then the constraint was lifted.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s kind of getting something tangible out there.</p>
<p>I want to show what we can do rather than talk about it.</p>
<p>And that put a lot of pressure on us</p>
<p>to do the right things.</p>
<p>And it also created a culture of accountability,</p>
<p>of a little bit more transparency,</p>
<p>and I think incentivized all of our early folks</p>
<p>and the company in the right way.</p>
<p>So what does the future look like</p>
<p>in terms of increasing people&rsquo;s access?</p>
<p>Or if you look at IoT, Internet of Things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more and more intelligent devices.</p>
<p>You can see there&rsquo;s some people even talking</p>
<p>about our personal data as a thing</p>
<p>that we could monetize more explicitly versus implicitly.</p>
<p>Sort of everything can become part of the economy.</p>
<p>Do you see, so what does the future of Square look like</p>
<p>in sort of giving people access in all kinds of ways</p>
<p>to being part of the economy as merchants and as consumers?</p>
<p>I believe that the currency we use</p>
<p>is a huge part of the answer.</p>
<p>And I believe that the internet deserves</p>
<p>and requires a native currency.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m such a huge believer in Bitcoin</p>
<p>because it just,</p>
<p>our biggest problem as a company right now</p>
<p>is we cannot act like an internet company.</p>
<p>Open a new market,</p>
<p>we have to have a partnership with a local bank.</p>
<p>We have to pay attention</p>
<p>to different regulatory onboarding environments.</p>
<p>And a digital currency like Bitcoin</p>
<p>takes a bunch of that away</p>
<p>where we can potentially launch a product</p>
<p>in every single market around the world</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all using the same currency.</p>
<p>And we have consistent understanding of regulation</p>
<p>and onboarding and what that means.</p>
<p>So I think the internet continuing to be accessible</p>
<p>to people is number one.</p>
<p>And then I think currency is number two.</p>
<p>And it will just allow for a lot more innovation,</p>
<p>a lot more speed in terms of what we can build</p>
<p>and others can build.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just really exciting.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I wanna be able to see that</p>
<p>and feel that in my lifetime.</p>
<p>So in this aspect and in other aspects,</p>
<p>you have a deep interest in cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and distributed ledger tech in general.</p>
<p>I talked to Vitalik Buterin yesterday on this podcast.</p>
<p>He says hi, by the way.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant, brilliant person.</p>
<p>Talked a lot about Bitcoin and Ethereum, of course.</p>
<p>So can you maybe linger on this point?</p>
<p>What do you find appealing about Bitcoin,</p>
<p>about digital currency?</p>
<p>Where do you see it going in the next 10, 20 years?</p>
<p>And what are some of the challenges with respect to Square</p>
<p>but also just bigger for our globally, for our world,</p>
<p>for the way we think about money?</p>
<p>I think the most beautiful thing about it</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s no one person setting the direction.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no one person on the other side</p>
<p>that can stop it.</p>
<p>So we have something that is pretty organic in nature</p>
<p>and very principled in its original design.</p>
<p>And I think the Bitcoin white paper</p>
<p>is one of the most seminal works of computer science</p>
<p>in the last 20, 30 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>I mean, it really is.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a pretty cool technology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not often talked about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much hype around digital currency</p>
<p>about the financial impacts of it.</p>
<p>But the actual technology is quite beautiful</p>
<p>from a computer science perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the underlying principles behind it</p>
<p>that went into it, even to the point</p>
<p>of releasing it under a pseudonym.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very, very powerful statement.</p>
<p>The timing of when it was released is powerful.</p>
<p>It was a total activist move.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s moving the world forward</p>
<p>in a way that I think is extremely noble and honorable</p>
<p>and enables everyone to be part of the story,</p>
<p>which is also really cool.</p>
<p>So you asked a question around 10 years and 20 years.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the amazing thing is no one knows.</p>
<p>And it can emerge.</p>
<p>And every person that comes into the ecosystem,</p>
<p>whether they be a developer or someone who uses it,</p>
<p>can change its direction in small and large ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think it should be,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the internet has shown is possible.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s complications with that, of course.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certainly companies that own large parts</p>
<p>of the internet and can direct it more than others.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not equal access</p>
<p>to every single person in the world just yet.</p>
<p>But all those problems are visible enough</p>
<p>to speak about them.</p>
<p>And to me, that gives confidence that they&rsquo;re solvable</p>
<p>in a relatively short timeframe.</p>
<p>I think the world should be able to do that.</p>
<p>I think the world changes a lot as we get these satellites</p>
<p>projecting the internet down to earth,</p>
<p>because it just removes a bunch of the former constraints</p>
<p>and really levels the playing field.</p>
<p>But a global currency,</p>
<p>which a native currency for the internet is a proxy for,</p>
<p>is a very powerful concept.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think any one person on this planet</p>
<p>truly understands the ramifications of that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of positives to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some negatives as well.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible that this kind of digital currency</p>
<p>would redefine the nature of money,</p>
<p>so become the main currency of the world,</p>
<p>as opposed to being tied to fiat currency</p>
<p>of different nations and sort of really push</p>
<p>the decentralization of control of money?</p>
<p>Definitely, but I think the bigger ramification</p>
<p>is how it affects how society works.</p>
<p>And I think there are many positive ramifications</p>
<p>Outside of just money.</p>
<p>Money is a foundational layer that enables so much more.</p>
<p>I was meeting with an entrepreneur in Ethiopia,</p>
<p>and payments is probably the number one problem to solve</p>
<p>across the continent,</p>
<p>both in terms of moving money across borders</p>
<p>between nations on the continent,</p>
<p>or the amount of corruption within the current system.</p>
<p>But the lack of easy ways to pay people</p>
<p>makes starting anything really difficult.</p>
<p>I met an entrepreneur who started the Lyft slash Uber</p>
<p>of Ethiopia, and one of the biggest problems she has</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not easy for her riders to pay the company,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy for her to pay the drivers.</p>
<p>And that definitely has stunted her growth</p>
<p>and made everything more challenging.</p>
<p>So the fact that she even has to think about payments</p>
<p>instead of thinking about the best rider experience</p>
<p>and the best driver experience is pretty telling.</p>
<p>So I think as we get a more durable, resilient</p>
<p>and global standard, we see a lot more innovation everywhere.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s no better case study for this</p>
<p>than the various countries within Africa</p>
<p>and their entrepreneurs who are trying to start things</p>
<p>within health or sustainability or transportation</p>
<p>or a lot of the companies that we&rsquo;ve seen here.</p>
<p>So the majority of companies I met in November</p>
<p>when I spent a month on the continent were payments oriented.</p>
<p>You mentioned, and this is a small tangent,</p>
<p>you mentioned the anonymous launch of Bitcoin</p>
<p>is a sort of profound philosophical statement.</p>
<p>Pseudonymous.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that even mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pseudonym.</p>
<p>First of all, let me ask.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an identity tied to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just anonymous, it&rsquo;s Nakamoto.</p>
<p>So Nakamoto might represent one person or multiple people.</p>
<p>But let me ask, are you Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>Just checking, catch you off guard.</p>
<p>And if I were, would I tell you?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Maybe you slip.</p>
<p>A pseudonym is constructed identity.</p>
<p>Anonymity is just kind of this random,</p>
<p>like drop something off and leave.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no intention to build an identity around it.</p>
<p>And while the identity being built was a short time window,</p>
<p>it was meant to stick around, I think, and to be known.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s being honored in how the community</p>
<p>thinks about building it,</p>
<p>like the concept of Satoshi&rsquo;s, for instance,</p>
<p>is one such example.</p>
<p>But I think it was smart not to do it anonymous,</p>
<p>not to do it as a real identity,</p>
<p>but to do it as pseudonym,</p>
<p>because I think it builds tangibility</p>
<p>and a little bit of empathy that this was a human</p>
<p>or a set of humans behind it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this natural identity that I can imagine.</p>
<p>But there is also a sacrifice of ego.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty powerful thing</p>
<p>from your perspective. Yeah, which is beautiful.</p>
<p>Would you do, sort of philosophically,</p>
<p>to ask you the question,</p>
<p>would you do all the same things you&rsquo;re doing now</p>
<p>if your name wasn&rsquo;t attached to it?</p>
<p>Sort of, if you had to sacrifice the ego,</p>
<p>put another way, is your ego deeply tied</p>
<p>in the decisions you&rsquo;ve been making?</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>I mean, I believe I would certainly attempt</p>
<p>to do the things without my name having</p>
<p>to be attached with it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to do that in a corporation, legally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the issue.</p>
<p>If I were to do more open source things,</p>
<p>then absolutely, I don&rsquo;t need my particular identity,</p>
<p>my real identity associated with it.</p>
<p>But I think the appreciation that comes</p>
<p>from doing something good and being able to see it</p>
<p>and see people use it is pretty overwhelming and powerful,</p>
<p>more so than maybe seeing your name in the headlines.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about artificial intelligence a little bit,</p>
<p>if we could.</p>
<p>70 years ago, Alan Turing formulated the Turing test.</p>
<p>To me, natural language is one of the most interesting</p>
<p>spaces of problems that are tackled</p>
<p>by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the canonical problem of what it means</p>
<p>to be intelligent.</p>
<p>He formulated it as the Turing test.</p>
<p>Let me ask sort of the broad question,</p>
<p>how hard do you think is it to pass the Turing test</p>
<p>in the space of language?</p>
<p>Just from a very practical standpoint,</p>
<p>I think where we are now and for at least years out</p>
<p>is one where the artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>machine learning, the deep learning models</p>
<p>can bubble up interestingness very, very quickly</p>
<p>and pair that with human discretion around severity,</p>
<p>around depth, around nuance and meaning.</p>
<p>I think for me, the chasm across for general intelligence</p>
<p>is to be able to explain why and the meaning</p>
<p>behind something.</p>
<p>Behind a decision.</p>
<p>Behind a decision or a set of data.</p>
<p>So the explainability part is kind of essential</p>
<p>to be able to explain the meaning behind something.</p>
<p>To explain using natural language</p>
<p>why the decisions were made, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean I think that&rsquo;s one of our biggest risks</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence going forward</p>
<p>is we are building a lot of black boxes</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t necessarily explain why they made a decision</p>
<p>or what criteria they used to make the decision.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trusting them more and more</p>
<p>from lending decisions to content recommendation</p>
<p>to driving to health.</p>
<p>Like a lot of us have watches that tell us</p>
<p>to understand how they&rsquo;re deciding that.</p>
<p>I mean that one&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>But you can imagine how complex they get.</p>
<p>And being able to explain the reasoning behind</p>
<p>some of those recommendations seems to be an essential part.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Which is a very hard problem because sometimes</p>
<p>even we can&rsquo;t explain why we make decisions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was, I think we&rsquo;re being sometimes</p>
<p>a little bit unfair to artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not very good at some of these things.</p>
<p>So do you think, apologize for the ridiculous</p>
<p>romanticized question, but on that line of thought,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll ever be able to build a system</p>
<p>like in the movie Her that you could fall in love with?</p>
<p>So have that kind of deep connection with.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t that already happened?</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t someone in Japan fallen in love with his AI?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be somebody</p>
<p>that does that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I mean at a much larger scale of actually building</p>
<p>relationships, of being deeper connections.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be love, but it&rsquo;s just deeper connections</p>
<p>with artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>So you mentioned explainability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s less a function of the artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and more a function of the individual</p>
<p>and how they find meaning and where they find meaning.</p>
<p>Do you think we humans can find meaning in technology</p>
<p>in this kind of way?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%, 100%.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it&rsquo;s a negative.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s constantly going to evolve.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, but meaning is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s entirely subjective.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be a function</p>
<p>of finding the magic algorithm</p>
<p>that enables everyone to love it.</p>
<p>But maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That question really gets at the difference</p>
<p>between human and machine.</p>
<p>So you had a little bit of an exchange with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Basically, I mean it&rsquo;s a trivial version of that,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a more fundamental question</p>
<p>of is it possible to tell the difference</p>
<p>between a bot and a human?</p>
<p>And do you think it&rsquo;s, if we look into the future,</p>
<p>10, 20 years out, do you think it would be possible</p>
<p>or is it even necessary to tell the difference</p>
<p>in the digital space between a human and a robot?</p>
<p>Can we have fulfilling relationships with each</p>
<p>or do we need to tell the difference between them?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s certainly useful in certain problem domains</p>
<p>to be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>I think in others it might not be as useful.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible for us today</p>
<p>to tell that difference?</p>
<p>Is the reverse the meta of the Turing test?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s interesting is I think the technology</p>
<p>to create is moving much faster</p>
<p>than the technology to detect, generally.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>So if you look at adversarial machine learning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of systems that try</p>
<p>to fool machine learning systems.</p>
<p>And at least for me, the hope is that the technology</p>
<p>to defend will always be right there, at least.</p>
<p>Your sense is that&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ll be right there.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a race, right?</p>
<p>So the detection technologies have to be two</p>
<p>or 10 steps ahead of the creation technologies.</p>
<p>This is a problem that I think the financial industry</p>
<p>will face more and more because a lot of our risk models,</p>
<p>for instance, are built around identity.</p>
<p>Payments ultimately comes down to identity.</p>
<p>And you can imagine a world where all this conversation</p>
<p>around deep fakes goes towards the direction</p>
<p>of a driver&rsquo;s license or passports or state identities.</p>
<p>And people construct identities in order</p>
<p>to get through a system such as ours</p>
<p>to start accepting credit cards or into the cash app.</p>
<p>And those technologies seem to be moving very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Our ability to detect them, I think,</p>
<p>is probably lagging at this point,</p>
<p>but certainly with more focus, we can get ahead of it.</p>
<p>But this is gonna touch everything.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s like security.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never going to be able</p>
<p>to build a perfect detection system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only going to be able to&hellip;</p>
<p>What we should be focused on is the speed of evolving it</p>
<p>and being able to take signals that show correctness</p>
<p>or errors as quickly as possible</p>
<p>and move and to be able to build that</p>
<p>into our newer models or the self learning models.</p>
<p>Do you have other worries?</p>
<p>Like some people, like Elon and others,</p>
<p>have worries of existential threats</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>of artificial general intelligence?</p>
<p>Or if you think more narrowly about threats</p>
<p>and concerns about more narrow artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>like what are your thoughts in this domain?</p>
<p>Do you have concerns or are you more optimistic?</p>
<p>I think Yuval in his book,</p>
<p>21 Lessons for the 21st Century,</p>
<p>his last chapter is around meditation.</p>
<p>And you look at the title of the chapter</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, it&rsquo;s all meditation.</p>
<p>But what was interesting about that chapter</p>
<p>is he believes that kids being born today,</p>
<p>growing up today, Google has a stronger sense</p>
<p>of their preferences than they do,</p>
<p>which you can easily imagine.</p>
<p>I can easily imagine today that Google probably knows</p>
<p>my preferences more than my mother does.</p>
<p>Maybe not me per se, but for someone growing up</p>
<p>only knowing the internet,</p>
<p>only knowing what Google is capable of,</p>
<p>or Facebook or Twitter or Square or any of these things,</p>
<p>the self awareness is being offloaded to other systems</p>
<p>and particularly these algorithms.</p>
<p>And his concern is that we lose that self awareness</p>
<p>because the self awareness is now outside of us</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s doing such a better job</p>
<p>at helping us direct our decisions around,</p>
<p>should I stand, should I walk today?</p>
<p>What doctor should I choose?</p>
<p>Who should I date?</p>
<p>All these things we&rsquo;re now seeing play out very quickly.</p>
<p>So he sees meditation as a tool to build that self awareness</p>
<p>and to bring the focus back on,</p>
<p>why do I make these decisions?</p>
<p>Why do I react in this way?</p>
<p>Why did I have this thought?</p>
<p>Where did that come from?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way to regain control.</p>
<p>Or awareness, maybe not control, but awareness</p>
<p>so that you can be aware that yes, I am,</p>
<p>I am, I am, I am, I am.</p>
<p>Yes, I am offloading this decision to this algorithm</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t fully understand</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t tell me why it&rsquo;s doing the things it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so complex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that the algorithm can&rsquo;t be a good thing.</p>
<p>And to me recommender systems,</p>
<p>the best of what they can do is to help guide you</p>
<p>on a journey of learning new ideas of learning period.</p>
<p>It can be a great thing, but do you know you&rsquo;re doing that?</p>
<p>Are you aware that you&rsquo;re inviting it to do that to you?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the risk he identifies, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfectly okay.</p>
<p>But are you aware that you have that invitation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s being acted upon?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a concern you&rsquo;re kind of highlighting</p>
<p>that without a lack of awareness,</p>
<p>you can just be like floating at sea.</p>
<p>So awareness is key in the future</p>
<p>of these artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>Yeah, the movie WALLY.</p>
<p>WALLY.</p>
<p>Which I think is one of Pixar&rsquo;s best movies</p>
<p>besides RATATOUILLI.</p>
<p>RATATOUILLI was incredible.</p>
<p>You had me until RATATOUILLI, okay.</p>
<p>RATATOUILLI was incredible.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;ve come to the first point</p>
<p>where we disagree, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the entrepreneurial story in the form of a rat.</p>
<p>I just remember just the soundtrack was really good, so.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, sticking on artificial intelligence</p>
<p>a little bit, about the displacement of jobs?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another perspective that candidates</p>
<p>like Andrew Yang talk about.</p>
<p>Yang gang forever.</p>
<p>Yang gang.</p>
<p>So he unfortunately, speaking of Yang gang,</p>
<p>has recently dropped out.</p>
<p>I know, it was very disappointing and depressing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but on the positive side,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s I think launching a podcast, so.</p>
<p>Really, cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, he just announced that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll try to talk you into trying</p>
<p>to come on to the podcast.</p>
<p>I will talk to him.</p>
<p>So. About RATATOUILLI.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe he&rsquo;ll be more welcoming</p>
<p>of the RATATOUILLI argument.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on his concerns</p>
<p>of the displacement of jobs, of automations,</p>
<p>of the, of course there&rsquo;s positive impacts</p>
<p>that could come from automation and AI,</p>
<p>but there could also be negative impacts.</p>
<p>And within that framework, what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about universal basic income?</p>
<p>So these interesting new ideas</p>
<p>of how we can empower people in the economy.</p>
<p>I think he was 100% right on almost every dimension.</p>
<p>We see this in Square&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>I mean, he identified truck drivers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Missouri.</p>
<p>And he certainly pointed to the concern</p>
<p>and the issue that people from where I&rsquo;m from</p>
<p>feel every single day that is often invisible</p>
<p>and not talked about enough.</p>
<p>You know, the next big one is cashiers.</p>
<p>This is where it pertains to Square&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>We are seeing more and more of the point of sale</p>
<p>move to the individual customer&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>in the form of their phone and apps</p>
<p>and preorder and order ahead.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing more kiosks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing more things like Amazon Go.</p>
<p>And the number of workers as a cashier in retail is immense.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s no real answers</p>
<p>on how they transform their skills</p>
<p>and work into something else.</p>
<p>And I think that does lead to a lot</p>
<p>of really negative ramifications.</p>
<p>And the important point that he brought up</p>
<p>around universal basic income</p>
<p>is given that the shift is going to come</p>
<p>and given it is going to take time</p>
<p>to set people up with new skills and new careers,</p>
<p>they need to have a floor to be able to survive.</p>
<p>And this $1,000 a month is such a floor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to incentivize you to quit your job</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not enough,</p>
<p>but it will enable you to not have to worry</p>
<p>as much about just getting on day to day</p>
<p>so that you can focus on what am I going to do now</p>
<p>and what am I going to, what skills do I need to acquire?</p>
<p>And I think, you know, a lot of people point</p>
<p>to the fact that, you know, during the industrial age,</p>
<p>we had the same concerns around automation,</p>
<p>factory lines and everything worked out okay.</p>
<p>But the biggest change is just the velocity</p>
<p>and the centralization of a lot of the things</p>
<p>that make this work, which is the data</p>
<p>and the algorithms that work on this data.</p>
<p>I think that the second biggest scary thing</p>
<p>is just how around AI is just who actually owns the data</p>
<p>and who can operate on it.</p>
<p>And are we able to share the insights from the data</p>
<p>so that we can also build algorithms that help our needs</p>
<p>or help our business or whatnot?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I think regulation could play</p>
<p>a strong and positive part.</p>
<p>First, looking at the primitives of AI</p>
<p>and the tools we use to build these services</p>
<p>that will ultimately touch every single aspect</p>
<p>of the human experience.</p>
<p>And then where data is owned and how it&rsquo;s shared.</p>
<p>So those are the answers that as a society, as a world,</p>
<p>we need to have better answers around,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re currently not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just way too centralized</p>
<p>into a few very, very large companies.</p>
<p>But I think it was spot on with identifying the problem</p>
<p>and proposing solutions that would actually work.</p>
<p>At least that we learned from that you could expand</p>
<p>or evolve, but I mean, I think UBI is well past its due.</p>
<p>I mean, it was certainly trumpeted by Martin Luther King</p>
<p>and even before him as well.</p>
<p>And like you said, the exact $1,000 mark</p>
<p>might not be the correct one,</p>
<p>but you should take the steps to try to implement</p>
<p>these solutions and see what works.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>So I think you and I eat similar diets,</p>
<p>and at least I was.</p>
<p>The first time I&rsquo;ve heard this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I was doing it before.</p>
<p>First time anyone has said that to me, in this case anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s becoming more and more cool.</p>
<p>But I was doing it before it was cool.</p>
<p>So intermittent fasting and fasting in general,</p>
<p>I really enjoy, I love food,</p>
<p>but I enjoy the, I also love suffering because I&rsquo;m Russian.</p>
<p>So fasting kind of makes you appreciate the,</p>
<p>makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow.</p>
<p>But I have, outside the philosophical stuff,</p>
<p>I have a more specific question.</p>
<p>It also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker,</p>
<p>like from the scientific perspective,</p>
<p>to sit there for many hours and focus deeply.</p>
<p>Maybe you were a hacker before you were CEO.</p>
<p>What have you learned about diet, lifestyle,</p>
<p>mindset that helps you maximize mental performance,</p>
<p>to be able to focus for,</p>
<p>to think deeply in this world of distractions?</p>
<p>I think I just took it for granted for too long.</p>
<p>Which aspect?</p>
<p>Just the social structure of we eat three meals a day</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s snacks in between.</p>
<p>And I just never really asked the question, why?</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, in case people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people know,</p>
<p>but you at least, you famously eat once a day.</p>
<p>You still eat once a day?</p>
<p>Yep, I eat dinner.</p>
<p>By the way, what made you decide to eat once a day?</p>
<p>Like, cause to me that was a huge revolution</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to eat breakfast.</p>
<p>That was like, I felt like I was a rebel.</p>
<p>Like I abandoned my parents or something</p>
<p>and became an anarchist.</p>
<p>When you first, like the first week you start doing it,</p>
<p>it feels that you kind of like have a superpower.</p>
<p>Then you realize it&rsquo;s not really a superpower.</p>
<p>But it, I think you realize,</p>
<p>at least I realized like it just how much is,</p>
<p>how much our mind dictates what we&rsquo;re possible of.</p>
<p>And sometimes we have structures around us</p>
<p>that incentivize like, this three meal a day thing,</p>
<p>which was purely social structure</p>
<p>versus necessity for our health and for our bodies.</p>
<p>And I did it just, I started doing it</p>
<p>because I played a lot with my diet when I was a kid</p>
<p>and I was vegan for two years</p>
<p>and just went all over the place just because I,</p>
<p>you know, health is the most precious thing we have</p>
<p>and none of us really understand it.</p>
<p>So being able to ask the question through experiments</p>
<p>that I can perform on myself</p>
<p>and learn about is compelling to me.</p>
<p>And I heard this one guy on a podcast, Wim Hof,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s famous for doing ice baths and holding his breath</p>
<p>and all these things.</p>
<p>He said he only eats one meal a day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, that sounds super challenging</p>
<p>and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p>So I just, I learn the most when I make myself,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say suffer,</p>
<p>but when I make myself feel uncomfortable</p>
<p>because everything comes to bear in those moments</p>
<p>and you really learn what you&rsquo;re about or what you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been doing that my whole life.</p>
<p>Like when I was a kid, I could not,</p>
<p>like I was, I could not speak.</p>
<p>Like I had to go to a speech therapist</p>
<p>and it made me extremely shy.</p>
<p>And then one day I realized I can&rsquo;t keep doing this</p>
<p>and I signed up for the speech club.</p>
<p>And it was the most uncomfortable thing</p>
<p>I could imagine doing, getting a topic on a note card,</p>
<p>having five minutes to write a speech</p>
<p>about whatever that topic is,</p>
<p>not being able to use the note card while speaking</p>
<p>and speaking for five minutes about that topic.</p>
<p>So, but it just, it puts so much,</p>
<p>it gave me so much perspective</p>
<p>around the power of communication,</p>
<p>around my own deficiencies</p>
<p>and around if I set my mind to do something, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>So it gave me a lot more confidence.</p>
<p>So I see fasting in the same light.</p>
<p>This is something that was interesting,</p>
<p>challenging, uncomfortable,</p>
<p>and has given me so much learning and benefit as a result.</p>
<p>And it will lead to other things that I&rsquo;ll experiment with</p>
<p>and play with, but yeah,</p>
<p>it does feel a little bit like a superpower sometimes.</p>
<p>The most boring superpower one can imagine.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s quite incredible.</p>
<p>The clarity of mind is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Speaking of suffering,</p>
<p>you kind of talk about facing difficult ideas.</p>
<p>You meditate, you think about the broad context of life,</p>
<p>of our societies.</p>
<p>Let me ask, sort of apologize again</p>
<p>for the romanticized question,</p>
<p>but do you ponder your own mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about death,</p>
<p>about the finiteness of human existence</p>
<p>when you meditate, when you think about it?</p>
<p>And if you do, what,</p>
<p>how do you make sense of it, that this thing ends?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t try to make sense of it.</p>
<p>I do think about it every day.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a daily, multiple times a day.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not afraid of it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a transformation, I don&rsquo;t know to what,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a tool</p>
<p>to feel the importance of every moment.</p>
<p>So I just use it as a reminder, like I have an hour.</p>
<p>Is this really what I&rsquo;m going to spend the hour doing?</p>
<p>Like I only have so many more sunsets and sunrises to watch.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not going to get up for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make sure that I try to see it.</p>
<p>So it just puts a lot into perspective</p>
<p>and it helps me prioritize.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t see it as something that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that I dread or is dreadful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool that is available</p>
<p>to every single person to use every day</p>
<p>because it shows how precious life is.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s reminders every single day,</p>
<p>whether it be your own health or a friend or a coworker</p>
<p>or something you see in the news.</p>
<p>So to me it&rsquo;s just a question</p>
<p>of what we do with our daily reminder.</p>
<p>And for me, it&rsquo;s am I really focused on what matters?</p>
<p>And sometimes that might be work,</p>
<p>sometimes that might be friendships or family</p>
<p>or relationships or whatnot,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the ultimate clarifier in that sense.</p>
<p>So on the question of what matters,</p>
<p>another ridiculously big question of</p>
<p>once you try to make sense of it,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of it all,</p>
<p>the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What gives you purpose, happiness, meaning?</p>
<p>A lot does.</p>
<p>I mean, just being able to be aware</p>
<p>of the fact that I&rsquo;m alive is pretty meaningful.</p>
<p>The connections I feel with individuals,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re people I just meet</p>
<p>or long lasting friendships or my family is meaningful.</p>
<p>Seeing people use something that I helped build</p>
<p>is really meaningful and powerful to me.</p>
<p>But that sense of, I mean,</p>
<p>I think ultimately it comes down to a sense of connection</p>
<p>and just feeling like I am bigger,</p>
<p>I am part of something that&rsquo;s bigger than myself</p>
<p>and like I can feel it directly</p>
<p>in small ways or large ways,</p>
<p>however it manifests is probably it.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty fun one if we are,</p>
<p>but also crazy and random and wrought with tons of problems.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>Would you have it any other way?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I just think it&rsquo;s taken us way too long</p>
<p>as a planet to realize we&rsquo;re all in this together</p>
<p>and we all are connected in very significant ways.</p>
<p>I think we hide our connectivity very well through ego,</p>
<p>through whatever it is of the day.</p>
<p>But that is the one thing I would wanna work</p>
<p>towards changing and that&rsquo;s how I would have it another way.</p>
<p>Cause if we can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>then how are we gonna connect to all the other simulations?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s the next step is like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the other simulation.</p>
<p>Escaping this one and yeah.</p>
<p>Spanning across the multiple simulations</p>
<p>and sharing in and on the fun.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it.</p>
<p>Jack, thank you so much for all the work you do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably other ways that we&rsquo;ve ended this</p>
<p>and other simulations that may have been better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for talking today.</p>

<p>about Bitcoin from Paul Graham.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very intrigued by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It has all the signs of a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Hackers love it, yet it is described as a toy,</p>
<p>just like microcomputers.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
