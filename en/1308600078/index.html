    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Ido Portal.</p>
<p>Ido Portal is somebody who truly defies formal definition.</p>
<p>He is, however, credited by many</p>
<p>to be the world expert in all things movement.</p>
<p>Movement is one of the more fascinating</p>
<p>and important aspects of our nervous system.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the great Nobel Prize winner,</p>
<p>Sherrington, that said movement is the final common path.</p>
<p>And what he was referring to is the fact</p>
<p>that so much of our nervous system</p>
<p>is dedicated to movement,</p>
<p>and in particular, that the human nervous system</p>
<p>can generate the greatest variety of forms of movement.</p>
<p>We can run, we can jump, we can crawl,</p>
<p>we can move at different speeds.</p>
<p>Far more variation in movement</p>
<p>and different types and speeds of movement</p>
<p>than any other animal in the animal kingdom can perform.</p>
<p>My interest in bringing Ido Portal onto this podcast</p>
<p>stemmed from a discussion about just that,</p>
<p>about Sherrington and the enormous range of movements</p>
<p>that humans can engage in.</p>
<p>Ido is both a practitioner and an intellectual.</p>
<p>We all know what a practitioner is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somebody who walks the walk,</p>
<p>who actually performs the thing</p>
<p>that they are knowledgeable about.</p>
<p>And indeed, Ido has studied capoeira,</p>
<p>a number of other martial arts, dance, gymnastics,</p>
<p>various forms of sport.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trained top athletes like Conor McGregor,</p>
<p>and he has many, many other credits to his name</p>
<p>as a practitioner and teacher.</p>
<p>However, he is also a true intellectual of movement.</p>
<p>I define an intellectual as somebody</p>
<p>who can both think about and talk about a subject</p>
<p>at multiple levels of granularity,</p>
<p>that is with exquisite detail and with exquisite simplicity,</p>
<p>depending on their audience</p>
<p>and depending on the topic at hand.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon hear from my discussion with Ido,</p>
<p>he is both a practitioner</p>
<p>and a true intellectual of all things movement.</p>
<p>Today, through our discussion,</p>
<p>you will learn how the nervous system generates movement</p>
<p>and the different forms of movement,</p>
<p>the different speeds of movement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going to get an incredible insight</p>
<p>through Ido&rsquo;s mind and eyes of how movement can serve us</p>
<p>in the various contexts of life,</p>
<p>not just in sport, not just in exercise,</p>
<p>but in every aspect of our lives</p>
<p>from the time we get up in the morning</p>
<p>until the time we go to sleep at night,</p>
<p>how we engage with others, how we engage with ourselves,</p>
<p>indeed, how movement even informs relationships</p>
<p>of different kinds.</p>
<p>I found our discussion to be one of the most enlightening</p>
<p>and interesting discussions that I&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<p>not just about movement, but about the nervous system.</p>
<p>I can assure you that by the end of this episode,</p>
<p>you will not only learn a tremendous amount about movement</p>
<p>through the eyes and mind of the one and only Ido Portal,</p>
<p>but you also will learn a tremendous amount of neuroscience</p>
<p>about how the cells and circuits and hormones</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters of your body</p>
<p>assist in creating the various forms of movement</p>
<p>that you can generate,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to learn and generate,</p>
<p>and that perhaps you should think about</p>
<p>trying to learn and generate.</p>
<p>And indeed, you&rsquo;ll learn some protocols and tools</p>
<p>for how to do that.</p>
<p>In science, we have a phrase, actually, it&rsquo;s a title</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s reserved for only the rarest of individuals.</p>
<p>We say that somebody is an N of one,</p>
<p>meaning a sample size of one.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon learn, Ido Portal is truly an N of one.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>

<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise.</p>
<p>Our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Ido Portal.</p>
<p>Ido, thank you for coming here today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to sitting down with you</p>
<p>to talk for a very long time.</p>
<p>I was first exposed to your work,</p>
<p>my post or a podcast, I believe,</p>
<p>of you had a group of people walking down handrails,</p>
<p>literally the handrails along stairwells,</p>
<p>and as a, I don&rsquo;t want to say former skateboarder,</p>
<p>once a skateboarder, always a skateboarder.</p>
<p>As a skateboarder, handrails have a particular meaning,</p>
<p>but I was really struck by, first of all,</p>
<p>the incredible range of skill that people had,</p>
<p>and yet their willingness to do this, right?</p>
<p>I think of handrails and walking on handrails</p>
<p>or skateboarding on handrails as a potential hazard,</p>
<p>and yet some of the incredible proficiency</p>
<p>that some of the people there, including yourself, had.</p>
<p>So like many people, I was drawn to your practice</p>
<p>and your work initially through a wide-eyed, wow,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing some incredible stuff on natural objects,</p>
<p>much as skateboarders or parkour folks do.</p>
<p>But over the years, we&rsquo;ve been in communication,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve come to realize that you&rsquo;re a true intellectual</p>
<p>of the topic of movement.</p>
<p>And I define an intellectual as somebody</p>
<p>who can understand a topic at multiple levels of granularity,</p>
<p>detailed, general, specific connections, et cetera.</p>
<p>So to start off, could you share with us</p>
<p>your conception of this idea of movement?</p>
<p>Obviously, movement involves translation through space,</p>
<p>but when you talk about a movement practice,</p>
<p>what are you really thinking about?</p>
<p>What are we talking about</p>
<p>when we talk about a movement practice?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>I somehow left the definition,</p>
<p>the very tight definition of it out for myself</p>
<p>because I felt it was starting to constrict me</p>
<p>and be around me,</p>
<p>and I let the practice itself really define it.</p>
<p>But I think part of our sense of everything</p>
<p>is actually a sense of movement,</p>
<p>and then the stillness in the background of that.</p>
<p>So for me, this is the entity that I refer to as movement,</p>
<p>and using that perspective for self-evolution, development,</p>
<p>of course, the physical side,</p>
<p>but also movement of emotions, movement of thoughts,</p>
<p>and any other movement streams.</p>
<p>And by switching these layers</p>
<p>and examining it from different places,</p>
<p>you get a better and better sense of it.</p>
<p>And I think the visuals nowadays and media</p>
<p>are what defines for people in the beginning things,</p>
<p>and then little by little with experience,</p>
<p>they can dive deeper, which is good.</p>
<p>There is some aspects, sexy aspects,</p>
<p>or not so sexy aspects,</p>
<p>and then you pull on it</p>
<p>and you start to examine and dive deeper,</p>
<p>and then you receive the gift of finding out more.</p>
<p>I heard you say once</p>
<p>that we are not just a brain with a body,</p>
<p>but we are a body with a brain,</p>
<p>which I absolutely love,</p>
<p>because as a student and a researcher of the nervous system,</p>
<p>I never think about the brain as its own isolated thing.</p>
<p>I think about the nervous system</p>
<p>and the fact that the brain and the spinal cord</p>
<p>are connected to the body,</p>
<p>and the body is connected to the brain in every direction.</p>
<p>Everything truly is connected at the physical level,</p>
<p>physiological level.</p>
<p>Could you just share for a moment</p>
<p>how you think about this body-brain relationship</p>
<p>in terms of, you mentioned movement of emotions,</p>
<p>movement of the body,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t really separate the two.</p>
<p>And for the typical person who&rsquo;s listening to this,</p>
<p>they might not immediately understand what that means.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s something that has to be experienced,</p>
<p>but when we think about the body and the brain</p>
<p>and the whole thing working as one cohesive whole,</p>
<p>what does that mean to you?</p>
<p>Or put simply, when you do a movement practice,</p>
<p>what are you focusing on?</p>
<p>Are you focusing on the movement of your limbs?</p>
<p>I have to imagine that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but are you also focusing on how that makes you feel</p>
<p>or how your feelings make you move?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so some thoughts.</p>
<p>I will try not to answer any of your questions</p>
<p>during this interview,</p>
<p>but I will definitely give some thoughts</p>
<p>and then we can play with it.</p>
<p>I think these definitions and in general,</p>
<p>the limitation of words ends up creating</p>
<p>some kind of a corruptive process.</p>
<p>The words corrupt us and corrupt our understanding.</p>
<p>So I think the brain-body,</p>
<p>this Cartesian state of mind and thinking</p>
<p>brought a lot of good,</p>
<p>but also brought a lot of problems.</p>
<p>And movement for me is the entity</p>
<p>that ties everything together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the magic, is the forza anima.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when the coin spins</p>
<p>and you see both sides appear at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful analogy from a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Dr. Rasmus Olme.</p>
<p>So the mind and body are one of those pairs</p>
<p>and I call it the movement-body-mind system.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s integrated, it&rsquo;s in motion.</p>
<p>There is also a stillness that appears there, of course.</p>
<p>Without it, there can be no motion,</p>
<p>but maybe that is a very good way</p>
<p>to start to think of things.</p>
<p>There is no really pure mental processes,</p>
<p>cognitive processes.</p>
<p>There is no pure physical processes.</p>
<p>Everything touches everything.</p>
<p>There is a wholeness and that wholeness is in motion.</p>
<p>And yeah, the movement practice takes these bits</p>
<p>and examine them.</p>
<p>And here is a pragmatic thing.</p>
<p>The scientist, the cerebral thinking about movement,</p>
<p>this is important.</p>
<p>The emotional side,</p>
<p>coloring, feeling the colors and the textures of motion.</p>
<p>A lot of people who are involved with a movement practice</p>
<p>never end up feeling motions,</p>
<p>really focusing on how it makes you feel</p>
<p>or how it feels itself.</p>
<p>And then the actual movement, the action.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s action, emotion, and thought.</p>
<p>And those are three streams of movement</p>
<p>and they interlace together into this kind of</p>
<p>braided experience and whole experience.</p>
<p>And I try to bring all these aspects into my practice</p>
<p>and the way that I live my life.</p>
<p>I think most people who embark on a movement practice</p>
<p>will first want to know which movements to do, right?</p>
<p>Squats, planks, pushups, pirouettes, right?</p>
<p>Pick your movement.</p>
<p>It could be any movement.</p>
<p>Are there any sort of just basic entry points</p>
<p>that you believe everybody should walk through</p>
<p>as they embrace a movement practice?</p>
<p>The first time and maybe even every time</p>
<p>they do a movement practice.</p>
<p>I mean, earlier today, I had the great privilege</p>
<p>of being guided through a long series of movement practices.</p>
<p>And yet the first practice we did involved,</p>
<p>at first anyway, stillness, not movement.</p>
<p>So if you would, could you inform us</p>
<p>how people should think about</p>
<p>approaching a movement practice?</p>
<p>What is the first layer of any good movement practice?</p>
<p>So you touch the word movements</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important for me to separate it</p>
<p>from the word movement with a capital M.</p>
<p>Movements are the containers and movement is the content</p>
<p>and the content cannot be carried</p>
<p>in any way without containers.</p>
<p>So the first entry point is to choose containers.</p>
<p>And then the second thing to make sure</p>
<p>is to put specific content into those containers</p>
<p>and then enjoy them.</p>
<p>I tell people that it&rsquo;s like a cup of water</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being handed that cup of water.</p>
<p>Nowadays, very often people will start to chew on the cup</p>
<p>instead of drinking the water,</p>
<p>making it yours, discard the cup.</p>
<p>And then maybe later you want to have bone broth or soup.</p>
<p>So you use a different container, a bowl.</p>
<p>So a movement practice to start can start from anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rhizome, it&rsquo;s an open system.</p>
<p>It has no center, it&rsquo;s decentralized</p>
<p>and it can be approached from anywhere.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s its magic and that&rsquo;s the benefit of it.</p>
<p>Some people find the body a good entry point.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t even enter from the body.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can enter from other perspectives</p>
<p>and then inside the body, for example,</p>
<p>where should we enter if we decided</p>
<p>to take the body approach?</p>
<p>The spine can be a nice decision,</p>
<p>but some will choose just the pelvis.</p>
<p>Any one of those points are valid</p>
<p>and then playfulness can be an entry point,</p>
<p>an attribute or, and this is so open.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to limit people and limit their minds</p>
<p>in the way that they engage with a practice,</p>
<p>but I also want to encourage the self-inquiry.</p>
<p>Am I doing movements practice</p>
<p>or am I doing a movement practice?</p>
<p>So could you help me distinguish the two</p>
<p>a little bit further?</p>
<p>I think I understand the difference</p>
<p>between a sort of the noun versus the verbs.</p>
<p>And in some ways here we are dealing with the challenge</p>
<p>of the barriers that language present</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s physical, right?</p>
<p>I mean, indeed there may not be a,</p>
<p>I have to assume there is no perfect verbal language</p>
<p>for movement.</p>
<p>There are certain movements that defy language.</p>
<p>I could say somebody jumped at a particular trajectory</p>
<p>at a particular speed and move this limb and that limb,</p>
<p>but by fractionating it,</p>
<p>something is most definitely lost.</p>
<p>So if someone wanted to, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>get in better touch with their body, in quotes,</p>
<p>in order to explore the infinite space that is movement,</p>
<p>how might they begin to approach that?</p>
<p>Is it, does it begin with an awareness,</p>
<p>with practice or both?</p>
<p>It begins with education.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s probably the most stable point of entry,</p>
<p>awareness to something as a concept,</p>
<p>that it is a concept, that there is a validity or,</p>
<p>because sometimes people look for that,</p>
<p>to looking at this entity, this open entity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why answering questions</p>
<p>is not something I can do or even attempt to do.</p>
<p>I believe in the power of the non-complete process,</p>
<p>like making this table, but leaving something undone,</p>
<p>not perfecting the product.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it offers some kind of a dynamic nature of evolution</p>
<p>that naturally unravels from it.</p>
<p>Almost like sometimes I do it,</p>
<p>I count reps and I&rsquo;ll only count to nine</p>
<p>because it tends to leave people in the count</p>
<p>and it keeps going instead of giving them the 10,</p>
<p>everyone wants to end on 10.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is because of the decimal system, et cetera.</p>
<p>So all kinds of things like that is also important</p>
<p>with the movement idea is to discuss, to examine,</p>
<p>to look, to taste, to try,</p>
<p>but then also not to try to capture,</p>
<p>because if you, like the invisible loop of Hofstadter,</p>
<p>if you look at it too closely, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>But if you look away, it functions</p>
<p>and exists just like us very powerfully</p>
<p>and obviously gives us the experiences that we have.</p>
<p>So when people enter movement practice,</p>
<p>it is about education, bringing some awareness</p>
<p>to the fact that they are living in a body,</p>
<p>that they are living in motion,</p>
<p>that their mind is a type of movement,</p>
<p>that their life is a type of movement,</p>
<p>bringing attention to the movement of the emotions as well,</p>
<p>bringing just attention to the fact</p>
<p>that things are in motion,</p>
<p>the Euroclitus Pantarei, all in flux.</p>
<p>Nothing stops besides something</p>
<p>that is the background of it and allows it to express,</p>
<p>and this is the beauty of things.</p>
<p>And this, for me, is the movement practice,</p>
<p>is this examination and bringing this awareness into things.</p>
<p>As we sit now here, I&rsquo;m also aware of my body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also aware of the way that things make me feel,</p>
<p>the way that your face is communicating to me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not just in some limited</p>
<p>and very verbal, overly verbal state</p>
<p>because it misses a lot of the beautiful flux.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to inject some, or project some ideas,</p>
<p>and perhaps you would tell me if they&rsquo;re ridiculous,</p>
<p>potentially useful or useful.</p>
<p>As I understand what we&rsquo;re talking about now</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;ve discussed earlier is that movement</p>
<p>can and should be incorporated into one&rsquo;s entire life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even heard you say that even before getting out of bed</p>
<p>in the morning, one can experience movement,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be of the intimate kind</p>
<p>with somebody else.</p>
<p>It can be paying attention to the rhythm of one&rsquo;s breath</p>
<p>or how you get out of the bed,</p>
<p>or actually in anticipation of you arriving here today,</p>
<p>I noticed that as I was going up and down the stairs</p>
<p>in this house, that I was injecting</p>
<p>a little bit of playfulness in the way</p>
<p>that I might have many, many decades ago,</p>
<p>but haven&rsquo;t for a very long time.</p>
<p>And I asked myself whether or not</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what Ido is referring to when he talks</p>
<p>about threading this body awareness throughout the day,</p>
<p>as opposed to, but of course, not exclusive</p>
<p>from just saying, I have 45 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do movement practice before I shower</p>
<p>and have some dinner, right?</p>
<p>I have to imagine both are helpful,</p>
<p>but in terms of moving through the day</p>
<p>and having bodily awareness,</p>
<p>clearly there are an infinite number of ways</p>
<p>one could do that.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just share a few.</p>
<p>You mentioned, I mean, one could pay attention</p>
<p>to their breath, could pay attention to posture,</p>
<p>and this notion of play is a very attractive,</p>
<p>or as we say in science, it&rsquo;s a sticky concept,</p>
<p>a concept that kind of draws one in.</p>
<p>Maybe if you would, could you share with us</p>
<p>just some ideas to get people thinking about</p>
<p>or maybe even incorporating movement practice</p>
<p>into their day, and maybe even touch</p>
<p>on the potential role of play or playfulness.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are some good directions.</p>
<p>I think one thing is this, what you call wordlessness.</p>
<p>I have been recommending to people nonverbal experiences</p>
<p>and the awareness of the body,</p>
<p>which is not really the awareness of the body,</p>
<p>as you know, not purely or not fully.</p>
<p>The awareness of motion is a very good way to start</p>
<p>to bring awareness to that layer.</p>
<p>And that layer will start to get clarified</p>
<p>more and more and more, the more you practice.</p>
<p>And then it will enable for most people a safe haven</p>
<p>away from many states and difficulties</p>
<p>and will unlock a lot of potential attributes</p>
<p>and strength and freshness and a lot of beautiful things.</p>
<p>Really, one of the pretty perspectives about who we are</p>
<p>comes from a person who influenced my thinking a lot,</p>
<p>Moshe Feldenkrais, the late Moshe Feldenkrais.</p>
<p>And he talks about the body as the core three elements,</p>
<p>the core nervous system.</p>
<p>Two is the mechanical system of muscle, skeleton, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the third is the environment,</p>
<p>which is a unique way to look at it.</p>
<p>And he talks about how the nervous system</p>
<p>is both receiving information from the outside</p>
<p>and from the inside.</p>
<p>And in the first years of life,</p>
<p>you work a lot on differentiating what is me</p>
<p>and what is not me.</p>
<p>And I think movement, when you feel movement,</p>
<p>you feel the movement of the outside</p>
<p>that is, of course, arriving to you and receiving this</p>
<p>and also your own internal movement.</p>
<p>And the same can be said for stillness.</p>
<p>So bringing the attention into those layers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tricky thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those elusive things to look at,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely of huge benefit to start to train it,</p>
<p>start to practice it, to feel not our thoughts,</p>
<p>not necessarily our body,</p>
<p>but to start to recognize the dynamic nature,</p>
<p>the flux, the motion.</p>
<p>And it occurs in all these layers.</p>
<p>So you will need to find it in multiple locations</p>
<p>before you start to more and more make it your own,</p>
<p>make it really yours.</p>
<p>How, for example, simple pragmatic things.</p>
<p>I used to do this, I spent some time in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I would need to get my practice in,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really turned off from commercial gyms</p>
<p>and there is not a lot of nature accessible there.</p>
<p>So I would just strap on my bag</p>
<p>and I would walk the streets of Hong Kong,</p>
<p>which are very crowded.</p>
<p>And then I would try to avoid touching anyone.</p>
<p>And it would be like two hours of just like moving involved,</p>
<p>fully involved, fully in my body</p>
<p>and experiencing beautiful things</p>
<p>and enjoying and developing myself as well</p>
<p>in all kinds of scenarios, up and down</p>
<p>and in the escalators and off.</p>
<p>So this is an example of a way to practice.</p>
<p>And then the way that we&rsquo;re sitting,</p>
<p>like these chairs, for example,</p>
<p>our chairs are not very dynamic,</p>
<p>but there is rocking chairs, right?</p>
<p>And this is something I recommend for a lot of kids.</p>
<p>Like in schools, I used to rock on the chair,</p>
<p>which is very common.</p>
<p>Yeah, I used to have my skateboard underneath my chair</p>
<p>and roll it back and forth</p>
<p>and the teacher would tell me to stop</p>
<p>and just slowly, little by little,</p>
<p>trying to get the most subtle movement I could</p>
<p>without them telling me that they were going to take it away</p>
<p>or try.</p>
<p>Which is probably horrible,</p>
<p>horrible advice and instruction,</p>
<p>just like sit up straight and chew with your mouth closed</p>
<p>because they remove a lot of the self-education</p>
<p>and a lot of the self-development</p>
<p>and the practicum and discoveries that are necessary</p>
<p>and even will damage focus</p>
<p>and thinking processes in some ways.</p>
<p>So for example, I would make the chairs even more mobile</p>
<p>and I would support more motion</p>
<p>and then I would be able to bring attention there,</p>
<p>but I would also be able to bring attention away from it</p>
<p>into other things and it keeps refreshing me.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t become stale, the water doesn&rsquo;t stand.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of movement.</p>
<p>So you can focus for long periods of time</p>
<p>and do incredible things with the mind,</p>
<p>with focus, with awareness, attention,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s with skin in the game.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not talking as some meditator</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s describing the act of being very focused,</p>
<p>but then I put a stick on the edge of his fingers</p>
<p>and I tell him balance it.</p>
<p>Everyone can do it for 10 seconds</p>
<p>and I tell him, okay, now hold it 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And you see that the skill has,</p>
<p>he has no skin in the game.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t developed in various scenarios,</p>
<p>but so there is a delusion that start to develop.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how movement keeps me very honest</p>
<p>and humble in the way that I view humility</p>
<p>and in a way that protects me</p>
<p>and keeps me, yeah, it keeps me fresh.</p>
<p>I love the example of moving through the crowded street</p>
<p>with a backpack because of the way</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s completely adaptive to the situation</p>
<p>you happen to be in and highlights the fact</p>
<p>that one doesn&rsquo;t need a gym or any specific scenario,</p>
<p>although we will certainly touch</p>
<p>on ideal learning circumstances for movement</p>
<p>and some of the work that you&rsquo;re doing, of course.</p>
<p>The less of your own personal practice</p>
<p>and understanding and knowledge you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>the more toys you need.</p>
<p>The more you&rsquo;ve really worked on yourself,</p>
<p>the more high-tech you are.</p>
<p>The more low-tech are your tools,</p>
<p>the more high-tech you are.</p>
<p>And this is the most advanced technology</p>
<p>by far on this planet.</p>
<p>With all the advancement,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t even start to scratch.</p>
<p>And you know it from the way that we understand the eyes</p>
<p>all the way to, with all due respect to the Boston robotics,</p>
<p>the five-year-old motion movements</p>
<p>or animal motion was very underdeveloped</p>
<p>still relatively to us as systems.</p>
<p>So important to remind ourselves.</p>
<p>A lot can be done with the body and gravity.</p>
<p>Floor, a piece of floor, a piece of wall,</p>
<p>a corner of a room is a beautiful scenario</p>
<p>which you can become discover in and play in.</p>
<p>But we are not so developed.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t see those options.</p>
<p>And this is something that I try to stimulate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I made it a point</p>
<p>to avoid any of the big sponsorship and high-tech tools.</p>
<p>And I on point brought a stick into big conventions</p>
<p>or sometimes I use a shirt with holes in it,</p>
<p>just like I use shirt as a point to make</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m addressing a crowd,</p>
<p>to keep things where it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important, we are important</p>
<p>and our experience is important.</p>
<p>And we have to be very careful.</p>
<p>These habits and these directions,</p>
<p>they come from many times good intention,</p>
<p>but they are the devil many times.</p>
<p>They turn into the devil,</p>
<p>just like our technology nowadays</p>
<p>and what is happening with people,</p>
<p>with depression, with meaninglessness,</p>
<p>with them also with the body in various perspectives</p>
<p>or even I will also flip it into high-performance sports</p>
<p>and their price,</p>
<p>because for me, this is not a movement practice.</p>
<p>It erases the person in the center of it.</p>
<p>And then came places like skateboarding or break dancing</p>
<p>where somebody with a disability</p>
<p>becomes the best in the world,</p>
<p>turns it into the biggest advantage,</p>
<p>but he would never be accepted into gymnastics class.</p>
<p>And I love that.</p>
<p>And that change, to place change in the center,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>You touched on a mention of a few sports.</p>
<p>Maybe it was Charles Polquin</p>
<p>or maybe it was another trainer</p>
<p>that I heard once say that for kids,</p>
<p>one of the worst things they can do</p>
<p>is over-specialize in a particular sport.</p>
<p>The idea being that it leads to improvements</p>
<p>in performance in a very narrow domain,</p>
<p>but they raised the idea</p>
<p>that it perhaps also constrains the development</p>
<p>of the nervous system such that certain emotional states,</p>
<p>certain intellectual abilities will forever be shut off</p>
<p>because of the intense plasticity</p>
<p>that occurs early in life.</p>
<p>The more I learn from you,</p>
<p>the more I&rsquo;m thinking that that statement</p>
<p>really should be extended to all of life.</p>
<p>And I loved to remind people</p>
<p>because I started off as a developmental neurobiologist</p>
<p>that development doesn&rsquo;t start and end.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have childhood and adulthood.</p>
<p>Our life is one long developmental arc</p>
<p>from birth until death, however long that might be.</p>
<p>So if one is going to be anti-specialist,</p>
<p>maybe even we call that a generalist,</p>
<p>what does that look like?</p>
<p>What are the different domains of movement practice?</p>
<p>And as I asked this, I realized I am in serious danger</p>
<p>of fractionating movement into a list of words</p>
<p>like strength and speed and explosiveness and suppleness,</p>
<p>a word that I&rsquo;ve heard you use before.</p>
<p>And yet I think for most people,</p>
<p>because we think in words often,</p>
<p>some of those categories can be useful.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I was going to embark on a movement practice</p>
<p>or a child was going to embark on a movement practice</p>
<p>either throughout the day or for a dedicated period of time.</p>
<p>What are the sorts of categories of movement</p>
<p>that I might want to think about?</p>
<p>Ballistic movement, smooth movement.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just enrich us</p>
<p>with some of the landscape around that.</p>
<p>Okay, first I&rsquo;ll address the first part that you mentioned.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned from you about certain changes</p>
<p>in the way that things develop later in life</p>
<p>versus earlier in life.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, it is something</p>
<p>that Charles Poliquin also mentioned</p>
<p>and I learned from back in the day as well from him,</p>
<p>which can seem dark a bit and kind of hopeless,</p>
<p>but then you should go beyond that.</p>
<p>One thing that does seem to appear for me</p>
<p>when I look around is the concept of unique postures.</p>
<p>And I think this is true for postures of thought,</p>
<p>emotional postures and movement postures.</p>
<p>Truly earlier in life,</p>
<p>we are creating these unique postures</p>
<p>and they get into these drawers or like a language, letters.</p>
<p>Later in life, the process moves more</p>
<p>towards integration of these unique postures</p>
<p>into all different organizations.</p>
<p>The beauty of it is that you can use very few postures</p>
<p>to create many possibilities,</p>
<p>just like a Leibniz search for a language</p>
<p>that contain one symbol only versus two,</p>
<p>which he discovered.</p>
<p>And this is something that is often seen.</p>
<p>Like you take someone who moves in a certain way</p>
<p>and you teach him all these new sports or techniques,</p>
<p>but essentially, if you look deeply and you&rsquo;re sensitive,</p>
<p>you see it&rsquo;s the same postures</p>
<p>that he will have to work with till the end of his life.</p>
<p>The same thinking postures.</p>
<p>And this is really problematic</p>
<p>where we are not freeing the mind</p>
<p>beyond this, how would I say,</p>
<p>a scaffolding of thinking.</p>
<p>And we are actually letting go of the content.</p>
<p>We get more and more focused on the way of thinking</p>
<p>versus the thinking itself or habitual ways</p>
<p>and forms of thinking, associative thinking, et cetera.</p>
<p>And emotionally, the same.</p>
<p>We are constructing these emotional postures</p>
<p>and then we have to go through the rest of our lives</p>
<p>working with that.</p>
<p>So this is the dark side.</p>
<p>But of course, there are always possibilities,</p>
<p>both, I think, invading this early system to some extent,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s 5% or 7% or whatever percent,</p>
<p>and also on the freeing yourself</p>
<p>of going beyond all postures, period.</p>
<p>Working with the postures you have,</p>
<p>but towards a posture-less way of doing things.</p>
<p>So this is something interesting to work</p>
<p>when people work with movements,</p>
<p>but finally are able to go into movement.</p>
<p>And this magic starts to happen.</p>
<p>And then the techniques fall apart and something appears.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a phase change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transformation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a, it&rsquo;s a binary moment.</p>
<p>There is a jump there, for sure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very rare to see,</p>
<p>both in thinking and emotionally and other ways.</p>
<p>We have many names for it.</p>
<p>And some talk about enlightenment</p>
<p>and some talk about all kinds of processes related to it.</p>
<p>And I think most of them are shadows of the sun,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the sun itself, really.</p>
<p>And then talking about ways of thinking about movement.</p>
<p>And this is where I use something</p>
<p>I call my slice and dice.</p>
<p>Because of the problem of using words</p>
<p>and definitions and categories,</p>
<p>I try to create a lot of them.</p>
<p>And I write them on the paper,</p>
<p>and then I crumble them, throw them into the bin.</p>
<p>And I keep doing it all my life.</p>
<p>The writing them down and the geeking on it</p>
<p>is very important, also very important to let it go.</p>
<p>I tell people, what you forgot is not the same,</p>
<p>forgetting is not the same as never knowing it.</p>
<p>The crumbling and throwing away is a form of forgetting,</p>
<p>but it leaves some kind of a homeopathic trace behind.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take some slice and dice and try to look at it.</p>
<p>Here is a physical one, contraction, relaxation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a spectrum.</p>
<p>And pretty much everything falls on this spectrum.</p>
<p>Also in terms of analyzing a person or yourself,</p>
<p>you can tell me if you feel closer to this side</p>
<p>or closer to that side.</p>
<p>And then it allows you to examine your practices.</p>
<p>How many of the practices are moving you towards balance?</p>
<p>And how many are it&rsquo;s your addiction</p>
<p>of just doing what you&rsquo;re good at versus what you need?</p>
<p>Here is another example, physical culture.</p>
<p>So we have the dense reality,</p>
<p>working with internal concepts and expressing them,</p>
<p>abstract concepts, expression.</p>
<p>Second perspective, the martial concept,</p>
<p>but not in the sense of just fighting,</p>
<p>but also partnering, working with another person,</p>
<p>a dynamic entity that is communicating with you.</p>
<p>That is communicating with you.</p>
<p>The third one is I call the elements,</p>
<p>working with the environment.</p>
<p>The next one is a somatic one, is the internal practice.</p>
<p>And of course they are all gray zones.</p>
<p>And another one is object manipulatory,</p>
<p>which you can think of it also as the environment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more small objects, heavy objects,</p>
<p>many objects, few objects.</p>
<p>And then you can look at these way of thinking</p>
<p>and you can say,</p>
<p>I have many of my practices in this direction,</p>
<p>but not say, and you can draw it for yourself.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another perspective.</p>
<p>And this way I use dozens of perspectives.</p>
<p>And with the years,</p>
<p>it gives people a sense of where they want to go,</p>
<p>how they want to do it and what they need to address</p>
<p>versus what they like to address, et cetera.</p>
<p>Is it helpful?</p>
<p>Very helpful.</p>
<p>Those different bins are very helpful.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that you mentioned</p>
<p>that people will often practice what they&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>as opposed to what they need.</p>
<p>In gym culture, we refer to this as</p>
<p>the guy that always skips leg day type person, right?</p>
<p>You know, big upper body, skinny legs,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll see people that have these enormous thick torsos</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re bench pressing all day,</p>
<p>but they clearly need to pull on an object</p>
<p>every once in a while to create some balance,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t do it because they, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>they have an obsession with moving</p>
<p>greater and greater poundage or something like that,</p>
<p>which in certain sports like powerlifting,</p>
<p>where aesthetics aren&rsquo;t the goal,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s simply to push more weight off one&rsquo;s chest,</p>
<p>you could imagine that there&rsquo;s something beneficial there.</p>
<p>However, I think that it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>in intellectual endeavors and in movement endeavors,</p>
<p>if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>to bring oneself to a place of real challenge</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier today,</p>
<p>I was in a state of constant challenge</p>
<p>because it was all new to me.</p>
<p>And as much as I told myself,</p>
<p>beginner&rsquo;s mind, beginner&rsquo;s mind, beginner&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard, I confess, to not want to do well,</p>
<p>to perform well, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a natural and healthy thing.</p>
<p>Not only natural, it is necessary.</p>
<p>But I want you to keep it on that side</p>
<p>and to bring something to balance it.</p>
<p>If there is not this challenge, the process will not work.</p>
<p>It has to be the scale.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about scales of pain, pleasure,</p>
<p>and this is another scale.</p>
<p>And this discomfort, again, is necessary</p>
<p>and should be recognized as I&rsquo;m in the right place.</p>
<p>When it becomes too high and I&rsquo;m unable to resolve,</p>
<p>to make any progress, I went overboard.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s not present, I don&rsquo;t do nothing here,</p>
<p>nothing that I&rsquo;m truly interested in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gratifying myself.</p>
<p>Wankery.</p>
<p>In essence, it&rsquo;s not about searching for the discomfort,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a marker.</p>
<p>And I think the question should be, who am I serving?</p>
<p>Because people do not serve themselves in essence.</p>
<p>They serve part, parts of it,</p>
<p>some kind of a fraction of themselves.</p>
<p>And this separation of oneself from oneself,</p>
<p>and this is also a result of the practice, a good practice.</p>
<p>I think maybe the biggest gift I received</p>
<p>from the practice is I can say,</p>
<p>although it will take maybe a certain context,</p>
<p>I am not my friend.</p>
<p>At times I am, but many times I am not my friend.</p>
<p>And by creating this separation,</p>
<p>I can assume a certain stability</p>
<p>in the face of everything,</p>
<p>all the way up to our own mortality and death,</p>
<p>which is, and maybe beyond, who knows?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a striking moment for me earlier today</p>
<p>when I was really challenged</p>
<p>with one of the practices we were doing.</p>
<p>And you said, this is exactly</p>
<p>what I experienced this morning, Andrew.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you said.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t imagine that you were having challenges</p>
<p>doing what I was attempting to do.</p>
<p>And of course you weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I believe what you were referring to</p>
<p>is that you had put yourself at that edge</p>
<p>earlier in the day in which you were making failures.</p>
<p>You were failing to execute the way</p>
<p>that you were attempting to execute movement.</p>
<p>I should just, to inject some neuroscience</p>
<p>and neuroplasticity there, I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>That is what I do after all.</p>
<p>There are beautiful data in animals and humans</p>
<p>showing that in the seconds and minutes</p>
<p>after a failed attempt at a motor execution of something,</p>
<p>the forebrain is in a heightened state of focus.</p>
<p>And when you hear it, it suddenly makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Of course, why would the nervous system change</p>
<p>unless it got a cue to change?</p>
<p>And the cue almost always comes in the form of frustration.</p>
<p>The eh, or as we said earlier, nah.</p>
<p>The nah signal is the one that preps you</p>
<p>to extract more learning from the subsequent trials.</p>
<p>And yet for a lot of people, they feel that ugh,</p>
<p>that failure to execute or even to approximate execution.</p>
<p>And they feel and experience the eh negative signal</p>
<p>and they lean out of the practice.</p>
<p>They start to depart either mentally or physically or both.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s anything I think that perhaps we can offer</p>
<p>is this understanding that that edge,</p>
<p>as some people call it,</p>
<p>or that failures aren&rsquo;t just necessary.</p>
<p>They are part of the learning process.</p>
<p>They are the entry gate to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Yes, contextualizing or recontextualizing</p>
<p>that sensation is something I work a lot with.</p>
<p>And I just reminded people and I also reminded to myself.</p>
<p>And if it wasn&rsquo;t difficult</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t need to redo it again and again,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be again on this correct scale,</p>
<p>which is dynamic and moving, just like rolling downhill.</p>
<p>So there is definitely a necessity to succeed, to orient.</p>
<p>There is certain aspects that you want to achieve,</p>
<p>but then there is also the letting go of it</p>
<p>and the de-ambitioning of it.</p>
<p>And within that tension,</p>
<p>the plus and the minus comes movement.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the,</p>
<p>and again, if I stretch it too far away,</p>
<p>or if I increase one of them too much,</p>
<p>then I would have some issues,</p>
<p>but you will, with practice,</p>
<p>learn to recognize the optimal point of progression.</p>
<p>Of course, it takes many years</p>
<p>and a lot of play and exposure to get a sense of it,</p>
<p>regardless of the layer in which it is applied.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure in your field and in your pursuits,</p>
<p>you are already aware of it and applying it in your life,</p>
<p>talking about focus,</p>
<p>talking about ways of thinking, creativity, et cetera.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s enough that I pull into another perspective</p>
<p>and you will see that people are specialists</p>
<p>and then they don&rsquo;t have really</p>
<p>the real essence of the concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not theirs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s applied specifically.</p>
<p>The one who changes all the time gets the general component</p>
<p>because what appears when everything changes,</p>
<p>that is that new entity.</p>
<p>Everything changes, something stays.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we want to get,</p>
<p>this concept and this understanding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the statement before,</p>
<p>we are just a meat vehicle, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just a sack of cells.</p>
<p>And I truly despise that statement</p>
<p>because first of all,</p>
<p>it deprives us of all meaning of our lives.</p>
<p>And we can go down the route of philosophy</p>
<p>as to whether or not there&rsquo;s meaning or not,</p>
<p>but more importantly,</p>
<p>it divorces us from the idea</p>
<p>that the body and brain are interconnected</p>
<p>and have at least equal value at any one moment</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re informing each other.</p>
<p>Emotions inform movement, movement informs emotions.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve heard you say before,</p>
<p>and I really love to hear you embellish on,</p>
<p>is this important principle that human beings</p>
<p>are truly unique in terms of the enormous range</p>
<p>of movements that we can perform.</p>
<p>And yet we are excellent,</p>
<p>maybe superior to all other species</p>
<p>at certain types of movement.</p>
<p>The one that comes to mind is walking, stride, striding.</p>
<p>So maybe we could just explore that idea</p>
<p>because obviously a cheetah is very fast.</p>
<p>The gibbon seems to have a lot of proficiency</p>
<p>at grabbing and swinging from branches.</p>
<p>But human beings perform an enormous</p>
<p>or can potentially perform an enormous array of movements.</p>
<p>Do you think all human beings are potentially able</p>
<p>to explore all the different types of movement?</p>
<p>And if so, how does one approach that?</p>
<p>So basically what I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m tabling a concept</p>
<p>which is not range of motion, right?</p>
<p>For the gym rats, discard with range of motion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the variety of movements.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s not important what I think,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s possible or not possible,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s even possible for you or not possible for you.</p>
<p>What is important is what you truly want to do,</p>
<p>what you truly are after.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important for me because many times</p>
<p>this way of thinking about things is already limited.</p>
<p>I like to say a man doesn&rsquo;t go to the ocean</p>
<p>to empty it with a spoon.</p>
<p>A lot of the types of dressing up of the concepts nowadays</p>
<p>is trying to fit an elephant into the hole in the needle.</p>
<p>Like for example, the concept of practice</p>
<p>and then our lives as if we have a life.</p>
<p>We have some kind of a stream of behaviors.</p>
<p>We have, there is an argument of free will, et cetera.</p>
<p>There is a multiplicity.</p>
<p>Definitely a man is a legion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real meaning of that phrase.</p>
<p>One day you wake up like this.</p>
<p>I say, Andrew, let&rsquo;s meet tomorrow at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s gonna wake up tomorrow.</p>
<p>And then you send me a text message.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m feeling off, right?</p>
<p>At 6.55 and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>So examining that and seeing that,</p>
<p>I think frees you up eventually</p>
<p>and start to orient you in a better direction.</p>
<p>So what do you want to do and what,</p>
<p>but in the orientation of also what you need to do,</p>
<p>what you sense and what you are developing</p>
<p>as a evolutionary direction for you,</p>
<p>this is the important bit.</p>
<p>Is it possible for everyone to engage</p>
<p>in certain specific physical movement?</p>
<p>For example, in Scandinavian countries,</p>
<p>the squat is not very approachable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more built for dragging heavy things.</p>
<p>And also in this climate, I guess it makes less sense</p>
<p>to squat because you&rsquo;re gonna freeze there.</p>
<p>So this is, and then you see the squat in warm climates</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like so open and accessible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very good deadlifters usually, not good squatters.</p>
<p>They want to get away from the ground.</p>
<p>Yeah, the shallow hip socket, which allows one activity,</p>
<p>but then the stability of the deep hip socket,</p>
<p>the architecture of the hip, the femur heads,</p>
<p>the Q angles, the shapes, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we are all unique and there are certain elements,</p>
<p>which like, for example, my squat challenge is like,</p>
<p>for most people, there is something there.</p>
<p>But do you remind people what the squat challenge is?</p>
<p>The squat was my attempt to bring a new fresh state of mind</p>
<p>into the word squat, not as a strength element,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fundamental resting position really,</p>
<p>actually should be one of the most abundant ones.</p>
<p>We replaced it with sitting,</p>
<p>which is not really, doesn&rsquo;t work well</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a natural environment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very comfortable actually to sit</p>
<p>for long periods of time, rocks and different terrain.</p>
<p>So you end up lying down, standing and squatting a lot.</p>
<p>Also, when you&rsquo;re moving low and dynamic,</p>
<p>like even collecting berries,</p>
<p>the squat is much more dynamic and open.</p>
<p>And then elimination is happening there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s such a fundamental thing</p>
<p>and we totally eliminated it.</p>
<p>We eliminated many other things, overhead movements,</p>
<p>behind the back, all kinds of back realm,</p>
<p>what they call the back realm is totally absent</p>
<p>in people&rsquo;s awareness.</p>
<p>So that was my attempt to bring it back into people.</p>
<p>And I recommend it in order to really get the transformation</p>
<p>going to accumulate 30 minutes a day in the squat position,</p>
<p>unloaded, just resting down, not correct, not erect.</p>
<p>Many people make this mistake.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t read through the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just resting down there.</p>
<p>And of course you have to be mindful of dosages.</p>
<p>Some people will get hurt if they try to do it too quickly.</p>
<p>So they might need a buildup process towards it.</p>
<p>And also I&rsquo;m not talking about 30 minutes straight,</p>
<p>but accumulation throughout the day.</p>
<p>And this does a lot of good for digestive problems,</p>
<p>for lower back pain, for hip pains, for knees,</p>
<p>and generally for aging,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically folding your body</p>
<p>in the most basic way.</p>
<p>Are you folding your body?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not folding your body,</p>
<p>you will lose the foldability of your body.</p>
<p>And this is probably the easiest</p>
<p>and the most abundant way to fold the body.</p>
<p>But this is an example of something</p>
<p>that can be very useful with many, many people,</p>
<p>but there will always be unique individuals</p>
<p>which need something else.</p>
<p>And there are benefits in examining things,</p>
<p>and also there are benefits in getting hurt,</p>
<p>which is not often discussed, especially not in these parts.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m one of the only ones as a teacher</p>
<p>that says I injured many of my students.</p>
<p>And if I did not do that,</p>
<p>I would be totally useless for them as well.</p>
<p>The totally safe system has nothing to offer, practically.</p>
<p>Nothing is totally safe.</p>
<p>And we can, of course,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t approach it with a ballsy or machoistic thing,</p>
<p>but we are aware that sometimes</p>
<p>we have to go beyond the boundaries.</p>
<p>And hopefully those would be the small injuries</p>
<p>that will help us avoid the big injuries.</p>
<p>But if you try to avoid the small injuries,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll get those big injuries in there.</p>
<p>So examining which types and forms of movement,</p>
<p>the location of the body, speed of execution,</p>
<p>the type of organization of the body,</p>
<p>which is a whole thing that we can discuss.</p>
<p>All of this is up for the grabs</p>
<p>and is something that we have to create</p>
<p>individual relationship with,</p>
<p>hopefully with good guidance,</p>
<p>where we can get the right scenarios,</p>
<p>a facilitator of good scenarios for our learning,</p>
<p>which is what I try to do,</p>
<p>and less of a technical state of mind,</p>
<p>do this A, B, C, or, yeah, like chunking</p>
<p>what I really dislike from a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like many people, they tell me,</p>
<p>have you met this guy?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing teacher</p>
<p>because he chunked the process into these bits</p>
<p>and not even in the correct places to chunk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and it doesn&rsquo;t offer,</p>
<p>it locks us this state of mind.</p>
<p>I talk about the chemistry model.</p>
<p>I call it my chemistry model,</p>
<p>where an atom, a molecule,</p>
<p>and then a compound is conceptualized</p>
<p>versus just chunking.</p>
<p>So there is an actual evolution,</p>
<p>like I call it also sketch learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to draw you.</p>
<p>If I know anything about art and drawing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start by capturing something very rough.</p>
<p>And I need to practice that first</p>
<p>that dynamic entity before I go into the rendering</p>
<p>and the shading, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the same way to learn things.</p>
<p>So big picture to small details.</p>
<p>And unlike many of my teachers that I ran into,</p>
<p>and I say with the greatest respect</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know who taught me more,</p>
<p>my good teachers or my worst teachers,</p>
<p>but some of them just teach from the small details</p>
<p>into a big picture that never arrives.</p>
<p>Given that humans can generate</p>
<p>such a broad array of types of movement,</p>
<p>run, jump, duck, squat, leap,</p>
<p>all these types of movements,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s value in observing</p>
<p>the movements of other animal species?</p>
<p>I know I certainly enjoy watching other animals move.</p>
<p>I think one of the more spectacular animal facts</p>
<p>that was shared with me is when I was a graduate student,</p>
<p>someone down the hall was working</p>
<p>on the little pedals of the chameleon</p>
<p>which can walk up walls.</p>
<p>And it was a great mystery</p>
<p>is whether or not they were suction,</p>
<p>but it turns out they can do it in a vacuum.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not suction.</p>
<p>Whether or not there was some sticky substance</p>
<p>and it turned out,</p>
<p>I feel compelled to share this with you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna do it because I have a feeling</p>
<p>it will lead us to an insight of some sort</p>
<p>that those little tiny pedals are so thin</p>
<p>and so close together that the chameleon</p>
<p>actually sticks to the wall</p>
<p>by what are called van der Waals forces.</p>
<p>Meaning it&rsquo;s a very weak molecular force,</p>
<p>but strong enough to stick to the wall</p>
<p>because they are actually exchanging molecules</p>
<p>with the surface they&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>So obviously we can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And yet I spent hours</p>
<p>because they were in the lab next door</p>
<p>watching videos of these little chameleons walk.</p>
<p>And the articulation of these feet is incredible</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re literally rolling</p>
<p>those little pedals along</p>
<p>in a way that defies anything else I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>I told myself this was useful,</p>
<p>A, because I thought it was interesting,</p>
<p>but B, because I never really thought about</p>
<p>how I articulate my foot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about being a heel striker</p>
<p>or a toe striker when I run,</p>
<p>and no one can tell me which one I&rsquo;m supposed to be.</p>
<p>Maybe you can tell me.</p>
<p>But the point is, or I suppose the question is,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s value in observing</p>
<p>the extremes of animal kingdom movement</p>
<p>as a way to inform the play space</p>
<p>and the exploration space</p>
<p>of our own human movement practice?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, first, it&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>It opens up, but I will take it away</p>
<p>from the romantic point of view.</p>
<p>And I would offer another way to examine</p>
<p>all these movements exist in us in ways, in certain ways.</p>
<p>Like the work of Grokovetsky on the spine,</p>
<p>the spinal engine.</p>
<p>And to see how these old ways of moving,</p>
<p>even all the way up to exoskeletons</p>
<p>and like primary, very ancient,</p>
<p>or even single cell things are still within us</p>
<p>to a certain extent.</p>
<p>And then, of course, this gets developed</p>
<p>and like the Darwinian state of mind</p>
<p>got stuck for many years on the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>But actually, I believe, I always believed,</p>
<p>and I saw some information about it lately</p>
<p>that mutation is the heart of the model,</p>
<p>not survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Yeah, people often hear the word mutation</p>
<p>and they think, oh, mutations are bad.</p>
<p>There are maladaptive mutations</p>
<p>and then there are adaptive mutations, for sure.</p>
<p>And it displaces the word change in the heart of it.</p>
<p>What it wants to do, change.</p>
<p>So it does not want to become better.</p>
<p>There is an inherent change in it.</p>
<p>And then, of course, they become better at X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>Fittest is the secondary perspective</p>
<p>that arrives in relation to certain things,</p>
<p>but there is still a stronger,</p>
<p>more ancient driving force into the process.</p>
<p>So for me, this is cool to see these animals</p>
<p>take it all the way to this extreme,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also still reflecting within us.</p>
<p>So I love to do like, for example,</p>
<p>I introduce with people spinal waves.</p>
<p>And by bringing these waves into the body,</p>
<p>sometimes you get weird experiences like emotional releases</p>
<p>and other times it can become an incredible tool</p>
<p>to help an athlete which specialized</p>
<p>and reached the top of the top.</p>
<p>And then you defrag his system a little bit</p>
<p>and offer him some freshness and some segmental movement.</p>
<p>And first you fuck him up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually the case.</p>
<p>Technically he&rsquo;s off, his coordination is off,</p>
<p>but later the growth will arrive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of playfulness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of examining things</p>
<p>regardless of their success or failure.</p>
<p>More understanding that change is important.</p>
<p>And then after that,</p>
<p>we can also look at the more competitive state of mind</p>
<p>and the more success and failure orientation.</p>
<p>But there is no game without change.</p>
<p>So this is the primary one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I say, okay,</p>
<p>you want to succeed in the tasks like we did earlier,</p>
<p>but you stayed within the game to sustain the game,</p>
<p>the infinite versus finite game, right?</p>
<p>Perspective.</p>
<p>To sustain the game means to continue to change,</p>
<p>continue to transform and then to win the game</p>
<p>sometimes mean game over.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, yeah, within that tension,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beautiful to play and to exist and to be.</p>
<p>You mentioned something that for me</p>
<p>is an incredibly important concept for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>And you mentioned these spinal waves, right?</p>
<p>I have to assume that&rsquo;s taking the torso for us,</p>
<p>you know, movement morons that are,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just refer to in course terms</p>
<p>instead of thoracic spine.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll stay away from the technical anatomy</p>
<p>and the torso and creating movement either side to side,</p>
<p>undulation or arching and extension of the spine.</p>
<p>Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side to side, rotational,</p>
<p>spiraling.</p>
<p>Have you ever had the experience that of yourself</p>
<p>or other people engaging in those types of movements</p>
<p>and experiencing particular categories of emotions?</p>
<p>And I have a particular reason for asking this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong answer, of course,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just curious whether or not movement of the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it the core of the body,</p>
<p>things close to the midline,</p>
<p>as opposed to far away from the midline,</p>
<p>like the digits far, is there any,</p>
<p>do you have any evidence that that can evoke</p>
<p>a certain category of emotional states?</p>
<p>Evidence, I have none,</p>
<p>but I have experience and I have some thoughts about it.</p>
<p>Ida Rolfe, who is known to have created rolfing</p>
<p>or structural integration,</p>
<p>said the issues are in the tissues.</p>
<p>And around the spine, the spine is us, as you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you can take an arm off a limb,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s been attempts,</p>
<p>but there is no brainy alone,</p>
<p>this cerebral thing alone,</p>
<p>that the spine and maybe more parts and systems</p>
<p>inside the torso are important.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I like to start from that core entity.</p>
<p>And then these little fluctuations, they create,</p>
<p>they unblock things, that they start to move things.</p>
<p>And you can avoid, funny enough,</p>
<p>mobilizing those areas by doing big frame motions</p>
<p>and competitive motions and techniques all your life.</p>
<p>So even someone, most yogis, for example,</p>
<p>they look extremely mobile,</p>
<p>but then when you&rsquo;re actually going into the small,</p>
<p>what I call the small frame,</p>
<p>I borrowed this from Chinese martial arts,</p>
<p>small frame, big frame.</p>
<p>The big frame is these big changes</p>
<p>of our total body in space posture.</p>
<p>And then the small frame is barely moving,</p>
<p>but mobilizing the little bits</p>
<p>that comprise the same pretty much posture.</p>
<p>So these are very beneficial</p>
<p>and it has totally disappeared from our physical culture.</p>
<p>When you introduce it back,</p>
<p>the small frame offers the big frame,</p>
<p>but the big frame doesn&rsquo;t offer the small frame,</p>
<p>because of course the small detail</p>
<p>come together into the big picture.</p>
<p>So if I want to place my body in a specific position</p>
<p>and I have all these bits moving well,</p>
<p>I can construct it in whatever way I want.</p>
<p>But if I just work on the big one,</p>
<p>most chances are I just mobilize certain areas</p>
<p>while other areas are totally held or blocked.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m specialized one more time,</p>
<p>take me out of this realm and I&rsquo;ll have difficulties.</p>
<p>What will sit there in this stagnation?</p>
<p>Emotion, material, thoughts, traumas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people get discharges.</p>
<p>And the body, memory is not what we think it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I believe it is stored everywhere.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had those experiences.</p>
<p>A lot of people have the opposite.</p>
<p>When a certain emotion is evoked,</p>
<p>they start to undulate the spine.</p>
<p>So this can be worked from this direction</p>
<p>or from this direction.</p>
<p>And I believe by applying such a practice,</p>
<p>it is wise.</p>
<p>You basically turn over the land</p>
<p>and you are allowing things to shift</p>
<p>and to move and to adapt.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>And we teach it in a very elaborate and gradual way.</p>
<p>And this is needed really because people,</p>
<p>when they just go into like some general recommendation,</p>
<p>they usually just get stuck into a new pattern.</p>
<p>Ah, that spinal wave, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been using, again,</p>
<p>these slice and dice like teaching.</p>
<p>Dozens of systems of moving the torso</p>
<p>until a person is freed to really move the torso.</p>
<p>Like the language is created,</p>
<p>the small enough units are created in your understanding</p>
<p>from all these systems.</p>
<p>And then you improvise,</p>
<p>you reach the highest level of the practice.</p>
<p>I love the answer.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a bit of why I asked.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a principle in neuroscience,</p>
<p>but especially in neuro evolution,</p>
<p>they call it evo-devo,</p>
<p>sometimes evolution and development, how those link.</p>
<p>If you look at, so we have motor neurons, as you know,</p>
<p>but for the audience that live in our spinal cord</p>
<p>that cause transmission and contraction of the muscles,</p>
<p>allow us to move our limbs.</p>
<p>And then we have motor neurons up here</p>
<p>called upper motor neurons</p>
<p>that control the motor lower ones.</p>
<p>So when something is reflexive or learned,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not thinking about it, so to speak.</p>
<p>We mainly use the lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>We know this because you can do an experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rather barbaric experiment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been done many times</p>
<p>called creating a decerebrate cat.</p>
<p>You actually remove the neocortex</p>
<p>and these cats will walk on a treadmill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called fictive motion.</p>
<p>No problem at all.</p>
<p>There are human beings who don&rsquo;t have a neocortex</p>
<p>or much of their neocortex is missing.</p>
<p>They generate perfectly fine movement.</p>
<p>The pattern has been downloaded.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s truly downloaded into the spine</p>
<p>and the connection between the spine and muscles.</p>
<p>Now, the motor neurons that control the spinal waves,</p>
<p>as you call them, are of a particular category.</p>
<p>They have a molecular signature, a physiological signature.</p>
<p>They were identified by, he&rsquo;s dead now,</p>
<p>but a biologist at Columbia University named Tom Jessel</p>
<p>and many of his scientific offspring.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>In fish or in animals that really only have the opportunity</p>
<p>to undulate and flap their little, you know, fins,</p>
<p>the motor neurons that control undulation in those animals</p>
<p>are identical molecularly to the motor neurons</p>
<p>that control the spinal undulation in humans.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been added in human evolution are extra rows,</p>
<p>literally categories of molecularly distinct neurons</p>
<p>so that as you move from the center of the body outward,</p>
<p>unlike a fish, which can move its fins,</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t actually articulate, it doesn&rsquo;t have digits.</p>
<p>We have special motor neurons to move these little bits,</p>
<p>these bits, these bits, and I can&rsquo;t do a spinal wave,</p>
<p>but I can do the mudras thing, like the belly thing.</p>
<p>That comes from seeing the movie E.T. when I was a kid</p>
<p>and puffing out my stomach and then realizing</p>
<p>that I could wave it, but only in one direction,</p>
<p>apparently not up.</p>
<p>Anyway, the yogis out there can chuckle at that, but-</p>
<p>The yogis actually do it to the side.</p>
<p>Oh, do they?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can do that.</p>
<p>Anyway, my spinal wave is weak, but I&rsquo;ll work on it.</p>
<p>But what I find so interesting about these layers of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say sophistication, but these,</p>
<p>with evolution came the addition</p>
<p>of more pools of opportunity.</p>
<p>These motor neuron pools, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>are opportunity to engage in new,</p>
<p>more elaborate types of movement.</p>
<p>But with each new pool became the opportunity</p>
<p>to create combinations of new movement.</p>
<p>The reason I asked you why spinal waves</p>
<p>create one category of movement is that</p>
<p>if you touch a fish on one side of its body,</p>
<p>it moves to the opposite side.</p>
<p>It never moves toward it.</p>
<p>But earlier we were doing a practice somewhat similar</p>
<p>of testing this similar reflex.</p>
<p>And sometimes I or someone will move toward a touch.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t deviate to the opposite side.</p>
<p>I have this untested, at least formally tested hypothesis</p>
<p>that movements of small digits and portions of our distal,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called, far from the midline body parts</p>
<p>evoke different sensations,</p>
<p>maybe even far more subtle sensations</p>
<p>than movements of the core of our body</p>
<p>and the stuff closer to the spine.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s just a theory,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m grateful for your answer</p>
<p>because it lands at least in the general vector direction</p>
<p>of my idea here.</p>
<p>The central orientation is mostly gone from our culture.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even walk basically these days.</p>
<p>If you look at traditional culture,</p>
<p>the amount of walking you do on a rest day, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>So we started to create technologies</p>
<p>to bring everything into the periphery,</p>
<p>controlling it with the fingertips, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we have incredible neurological development</p>
<p>relating to this,</p>
<p>but our central patterns, swimming, running,</p>
<p>jumping, throwing, throwing is not pushing away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example, right?</p>
<p>Some people, when you give them a ball to throw,</p>
<p>you can tell if they&rsquo;ve never thrown a ball before.</p>
<p>Yeah, they throw like a girl.</p>
<p>That is often said here in the U.S.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s of course unfair,</p>
<p>but it relates to experience, right?</p>
<p>That is less maybe promoted or offered for females.</p>
<p>So you get this peripheral pattern</p>
<p>instead of a central generated pattern</p>
<p>that progresses towards the extremities.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted to ask you is,</p>
<p>I know an area that is not often mentioned</p>
<p>is that some of these ancient patterns and systems</p>
<p>are primary in many ways.</p>
<p>Hence, those newer developments inside of us</p>
<p>are constrained by using the connections</p>
<p>running through these ancient systems.</p>
<p>Hence, we are much more limited by the gene pool.</p>
<p>We are hitchhikers on a piece of DNA, I like to say.</p>
<p>And that gene pool is driving something so primary</p>
<p>that even when you are in kind of the driver&rsquo;s seat</p>
<p>in your eyes, you&rsquo;re actually not,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re being totally constrained by that.</p>
<p>And I wanted to hear about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, recently we had a guest on the podcast</p>
<p>named Eric Jarvis.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at Rockefeller</p>
<p>who was offered a position to dance</p>
<p>with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company.</p>
<p>So an accomplished dancer and comes from a musical family,</p>
<p>chose to become a neuroscientist instead</p>
<p>and study speech and language.</p>
<p>But he said something incredible,</p>
<p>several incredible things.</p>
<p>Really looking forward to getting your reflections on.</p>
<p>First of all, he said that when you look at the species</p>
<p>in the kingdom of animals, including us,</p>
<p>that have elaborate language and true song,</p>
<p>they all also have the capacity to dance.</p>
<p>All of them, it turns out hummingbirds</p>
<p>actually have a dance and a song capacity</p>
<p>that perhaps, and this is the going idea now</p>
<p>in neuroscience and evolution of the brain,</p>
<p>that singing actually came before</p>
<p>finely articulated speech and language.</p>
<p>That voice evolved first to sing to communicate.</p>
<p>I mean, to enunciate, uh, or uh, or you know, or mm.</p>
<p>But then song may have come first.</p>
<p>Where you have song, you have dance</p>
<p>and the capacity to dance,</p>
<p>which of course is movement of the body.</p>
<p>And where you have song and dance,</p>
<p>you always find that those species</p>
<p>can generate elaborate language.</p>
<p>Now, the simple version of this is, okay,</p>
<p>sophisticated brains tend to create clusters</p>
<p>of sophisticated capabilities.</p>
<p>But the other possibility,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the one that Jarvis proposes,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s in line with what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>perhaps raising here, is the idea that movement of the body</p>
<p>and range and sophistication of movement of the body</p>
<p>through all these different systems</p>
<p>may have actually promoted or even driven the evolution</p>
<p>of the things that we think of as, you know,</p>
<p>speech and language and the ability to have multiple, uh,</p>
<p>words for the same concept</p>
<p>or to have elaborate articulation of speech.</p>
<p>I find this incredibly attractive as an idea</p>
<p>because certainly from, as a hierarchy of needs,</p>
<p>we needed to move first to survive and to mate</p>
<p>and to flee and to attack.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense to me that the layers</p>
<p>would be built up fundamentally from the body to the mind</p>
<p>and not the other way around.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one piece.</p>
<p>And then the other piece, which I&rsquo;ll just share</p>
<p>for any reflections you might have</p>
<p>that just blew me away was,</p>
<p>Jarvis told me that when we read,</p>
<p>if, and this has been done experimentally,</p>
<p>if one records the EMG, the low-level muscular activity</p>
<p>in the larynx and pharynx,</p>
<p>we are actually repeating the words that we read,</p>
<p>but so subtly so that we don&rsquo;t actually speak them out</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s some sort of neurologic deficit,</p>
<p>which some people have.</p>
<p>Some people mumble why they read,</p>
<p>but what that tells me is that language is movement</p>
<p>and movement is language.</p>
<p>So again, we have this convergence,</p>
<p>but at a very basic level, I&rsquo;d love your reflections on,</p>
<p>those are all his ideas.</p>
<p>I want to say, I&rsquo;m just repeating what he said</p>
<p>and not nearly as precisely as he did,</p>
<p>but how do you think of movement</p>
<p>as either the foundation of language</p>
<p>or as its own language that perhaps even defies words?</p>
<p>Wow, those are beautiful perspectives</p>
<p>and I definitely feel the same.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to say about singing and dancing as well</p>
<p>as also as a form of ancient programs of transmission.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is this in some ancient practices,</p>
<p>the mantras and the people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that they are tantric practices.</p>
<p>They contain a form of vibrating and breathing</p>
<p>all tied together into very elaborate way</p>
<p>to promote a certain effect.</p>
<p>And how would you do something like this in ancient times?</p>
<p>This is ingenious.</p>
<p>We, even until today, we need a full book</p>
<p>to describe something and it wouldn&rsquo;t work as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a very ancient form of transmission.</p>
<p>The more accurate we became with the language,</p>
<p>the more dead it became</p>
<p>because it is less of a movement entity.</p>
<p>It is less of a dynamic entity from its nature.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why Yukio Mishima says it&rsquo;s corrupting.</p>
<p>It corrupts us.</p>
<p>So definitely, definitely the conducing force</p>
<p>or the primary force for me is movement that is experienced.</p>
<p>Every time we talk about movement,</p>
<p>basically even now we are spilling it into a container</p>
<p>to call it what it is, but it is beyond that.</p>
<p>So then it is applied into dancing,</p>
<p>into singing, into language.</p>
<p>There is no other language that I see as a primary mode.</p>
<p>And this is a nature of space, time, things moving.</p>
<p>So I think everything moves into the direction</p>
<p>of understanding that more and more.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s not so popular to call it movement.</p>
<p>People have some connotations and it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You can throw away this word and put another word.</p>
<p>And we probably need to do that also, like regularly.</p>
<p>Like I start to see the end of this word for me.</p>
<p>Things get corrupted again, overused, abused.</p>
<p>And then we need a new word.</p>
<p>And even that word is only needed for communication</p>
<p>and for specific processes of education, exchange.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to stay within the experiences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to continue to promote scenarios</p>
<p>in which the experience is primary,</p>
<p>more open experience, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>and not try to hold down and define overly accurately</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s done, throwing it away and starting again.</p>
<p>So there is no winning concept.</p>
<p>You got to the winning concept, you got nothing.</p>
<p>You were able to grab it.</p>
<p>You were able to, this is very science, right?</p>
<p>Like we got it, we got it.</p>
<p>And then it turns out to be nothing.</p>
<p>And more and more time passes,</p>
<p>I feel science is becoming more humble</p>
<p>and things are being discussed in this way.</p>
<p>And because really what the science do,</p>
<p>report the sun came up a certain amount</p>
<p>of billions of times,</p>
<p>and then tomorrow it will come up again, statistics.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good prediction.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but we can go beyond.</p>
<p>There is something inside of us that can go beyond.</p>
<p>Hard to communicate, I can&rsquo;t offer it right now here,</p>
<p>but I have the experience and thankfully I have a practice</p>
<p>and a way to sense it, to feel it and to re-examine it.</p>
<p>And then we can talk about it</p>
<p>and have something from that.</p>
<p>Edward Wilson, the great sociobiologist,</p>
<p>he actually founded the field of sociobiology, E.O. Wilson,</p>
<p>they call him Edward Wilson,</p>
<p>had this beautiful word and indeed named a book.</p>
<p>Actually, the word was better than the book, sorry, Wilson,</p>
<p>but the book was a little bit meandering for my taste.</p>
<p>But then again, he&rsquo;s the Harvard professor, not me.</p>
<p>Well, Stanford&rsquo;s pretty darn good.</p>
<p>This word is conciliants,</p>
<p>this idea of a leaping together</p>
<p>of divergent forms of knowledge</p>
<p>to create a truly valuable concept, which I love.</p>
<p>I love it because, of course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m formally trained as a scientist,</p>
<p>I look at things mainly through the lens of neuroscience,</p>
<p>but experience is real and observation is real.</p>
<p>And even in the field of medicine,</p>
<p>you have double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials,</p>
<p>and then you have case studies,</p>
<p>and of one, right?</p>
<p>Not often discussed, right?</p>
<p>I mean, H.M., the most famous example in neuroscience</p>
<p>of a patient that had no hippocampus,</p>
<p>informed us more about the process of memory</p>
<p>and indeed the function of the hippocampus</p>
<p>than thousands of independent experiments that followed.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t have one,</p>
<p>you need all these different forms of exploration,</p>
<p>which is, I think we share the belief, if I may,</p>
<p>that convergent forms of knowledge,</p>
<p>eventually, this process of concealance,</p>
<p>can eject a new concept.</p>
<p>And yet the challenge, again,</p>
<p>is that if we don&rsquo;t have a language for it,</p>
<p>it becomes hard to transmit.</p>
<p>One of the things that I find incredibly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use this word again, sticky,</p>
<p>is this notion of movement culture.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who coined that phrase,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve seen it in the circles and accounts</p>
<p>around your Instagram account and others.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a phrase that you coined,</p>
<p>but this idea of engaging in movement practice with others,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s dance or other movement practices,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so dynamic, there&rsquo;s the unpredictability of it.</p>
<p>Even to, like today, two practitioners</p>
<p>at vastly different levels of knowledge and experience</p>
<p>in movement practice,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s information, I like to think,</p>
<p>to be gained from both sides.</p>
<p>So one thing that I&rsquo;ve heard you say before,</p>
<p>which really resonated with me,</p>
<p>is this idea that people have,</p>
<p>maybe in particular in the US,</p>
<p>have this concept of, oh, I have my yoga friends,</p>
<p>or the people I dance with are distinct</p>
<p>from my family friends, are distinct from,</p>
<p>but as you pointed out,</p>
<p>gathering around movement is an age-old tradition,</p>
<p>and that perhaps we&rsquo;d be better off</p>
<p>not thinking about people we exercise with or train with,</p>
<p>but that friendship and connection made through movement</p>
<p>is perhaps the most valuable form of connection.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a product of those practices</p>
<p>that are maybe not so aware</p>
<p>or not so movement-oriented in the open sense.</p>
<p>And then you get this sensation with people,</p>
<p>but alone we do nothing.</p>
<p>So much so that we&rsquo;re never alone also on the inside,</p>
<p>and we will manufacture and produce entities inside.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re constantly in a dynamic exchange,</p>
<p>cultural exchange.</p>
<p>And practically, I learned this lesson in Capoeira.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cultural manifestation.</p>
<p>Things happen within this context.</p>
<p>We rub against reality.</p>
<p>We rub against each other.</p>
<p>And their movement occurs,</p>
<p>and their insight is to be gained,</p>
<p>and development happens.</p>
<p>And then comes other thoughts,</p>
<p>collective knowledge versus self-knowledge.</p>
<p>We are transmitting knowledge.</p>
<p>If we go on top of some mountain,</p>
<p>20 people, 20 normal individuals,</p>
<p>and we spend 20 years just fighting,</p>
<p>four hours in the morning, four hours in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We do it for 20 years,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re isolated from any other source of knowledge.</p>
<p>We would still not reach anything</p>
<p>that a very young fighter these days has.</p>
<p>We will be unable to develop those techniques,</p>
<p>those insights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where collective knowledge comes in</p>
<p>and transmission jumps us forward.</p>
<p>But what is the problem with that?</p>
<p>Staying within just those technical constraints</p>
<p>and never making it yours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part of self-knowledge.</p>
<p>The digestion of this collective information</p>
<p>until it becomes digested</p>
<p>and becomes part of yourselves,</p>
<p>and then you are it versus you are doing it.</p>
<p>And this is a clear separation</p>
<p>that you can see in sports on a very high level</p>
<p>and on a not so high level.</p>
<p>Even though I would be honest if I say</p>
<p>that some people reach very far</p>
<p>just with collective knowledge</p>
<p>and a very technical approach,</p>
<p>and others reach extremely far with very little of it.</p>
<p>And there is always outliers.</p>
<p>There are always the outliers in that case.</p>
<p>Another thought I had when you mentioned evo-devo,</p>
<p>evolution development is also the Greek concepts</p>
<p>of poiesis and pisces.</p>
<p>The growing of the seed into the tree</p>
<p>and the other process of the manufacturing</p>
<p>of the chair from the tree.</p>
<p>Two processes of development evolution, very different.</p>
<p>One from everything to something,</p>
<p>the other from nothing to something.</p>
<p>One is accumulation based, one is subtraction based.</p>
<p>Both of these processes relate to collective knowledge,</p>
<p>self-knowledge, but they&rsquo;re not exactly just that.</p>
<p>And what is, what should we do?</p>
<p>This is a question that my friend Rasmus,</p>
<p>he asks in his thesis and thoughts.</p>
<p>What is the ultimate for us?</p>
<p>Should we manufacture our chair</p>
<p>or should we grow like into the tree?</p>
<p>Civilize the mind, leave savage the body.</p>
<p>Is it in this way?</p>
<p>Or should the mind also be left wild?</p>
<p>Wild and wise is a nice combination of words</p>
<p>that I like to place together, wild wise.</p>
<p>So this is something that I try to bring</p>
<p>into the way that I live my life and my practice.</p>
<p>And I try to bring the information and the wisdom</p>
<p>and the collective knowledge.</p>
<p>But I also try to let go of more and more</p>
<p>until an essence is gleaned, until something is appearing.</p>
<p>And because everything was already there.</p>
<p>For example, if I&rsquo;m sitting here,</p>
<p>all the movements are already occurring.</p>
<p>All the possibilities are, so it&rsquo;s just about,</p>
<p>I need to open, I open this window,</p>
<p>the air would come from here.</p>
<p>If I open this window, the air would come.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to drive my emotion.</p>
<p>I need to discover what is stopping it from happening.</p>
<p>Something is constantly holding.</p>
<p>And when we remove this, immediately movement appears.</p>
<p>This is real deep movement versus the driven movement</p>
<p>that is very wasteful at times.</p>
<p>Like walking, you see people pushing through the walk</p>
<p>instead of the controlled falling that it should be.</p>
<p>Fighting, punching, to manufacture the strength.</p>
<p>And then to have someone who knows</p>
<p>how to facilitate the conditions</p>
<p>in which you are knocked out.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t knock you out.</p>
<p>It hits versus I hit, like Bruce Lee said.</p>
<p>So this is a beautiful thing to examine</p>
<p>and to work within that.</p>
<p>So to see, am I skateboarding?</p>
<p>Am I using this perspective?</p>
<p>Or am I trying to control because of risk and danger?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to overly control something</p>
<p>that actually can never be controlled.</p>
<p>The way to control it is to let go of the control.</p>
<p>And then, okay, but what about all this collection</p>
<p>of information knowledge that I can bring in?</p>
<p>Where do I wanna play?</p>
<p>I can play down here or I can play up here.</p>
<p>The collective knowledge is maybe take you further in</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re still gonna need</p>
<p>to do your individual work.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to romanticize on that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t need teachers.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need nothing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fully honest.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need, but depends on where you wanna function</p>
<p>and how you wanna function.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t be demonized,</p>
<p>but they shouldn&rsquo;t be overly glorified as well.</p>
<p>You mentioned about the opportunity for movement,</p>
<p>perhaps even all forms of movement coming from deep within.</p>
<p>It raises to mind in the neuroscience of motor systems,</p>
<p>we talk about motor neurons, as I described,</p>
<p>the ones that actually evoke contraction of muscles.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this category of neurons</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t often discussed, but certainly exist,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t often discussed in kind of popular nomenclature</p>
<p>of neuroscience, which is the premotor system.</p>
<p>Most of our movements are the reflection</p>
<p>of certain patterns of transmission breaking through</p>
<p>from the premotor to the actual motor.</p>
<p>In other words, we are always</p>
<p>in a anticipatory mode of movement.</p>
<p>And I think you, the way you describe it,</p>
<p>you clearly intuitively understand this.</p>
<p>You feel it and you recognize it.</p>
<p>Think of it as, it&rsquo;s like a layer of neurons</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly humming, ready to go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the release of these gates</p>
<p>that allows movement to occur in a particular way.</p>
<p>Could be very smooth, could be very ballistic.</p>
<p>Which is DNA, the same, turning off and on.</p>
<p>But all the information is already there.</p>
<p>And then the possibilities are just allowed.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m allowed, I don&rsquo;t do free will already,</p>
<p>but I am allowed to do, I am, there are possibilities</p>
<p>and I am dancing within that dance,</p>
<p>but I am not the only dancer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my sensation, at least with most states</p>
<p>of being, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Maybe there is other states that could be reached,</p>
<p>a stability that will arrive from the waters,</p>
<p>from the movement of the waters.</p>
<p>This humming, these potential possibilities</p>
<p>to be in that state, to vibrate like this</p>
<p>is very powerful for our lives.</p>
<p>To wake up in the morning and feel that living thing</p>
<p>is the feeling of movement.</p>
<p>And for me, it&rsquo;s a result of the practice.</p>
<p>And so then it&rsquo;s easy not to stagnate</p>
<p>and then the mind can stay focused for hours</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve done today.</p>
<p>And I can listen and tune in and I won&rsquo;t lose you,</p>
<p>which is very difficult.</p>
<p>Like I haven&rsquo;t had a good conversation here in the U.S.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult and I&rsquo;ve had your attention</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re listening, but it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that somebody can do that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a struggle, always a struggle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely my trick, my dirty trick.</p>
<p>You said you&rsquo;re allowed.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m taking some of the language</p>
<p>and what you report about your experience</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to map it to some concepts</p>
<p>that relate to neural circuits.</p>
<p>In the principles of neuroscience,</p>
<p>we talk about instructiveness versus permissiveness.</p>
<p>There are instructive cues, like for instance,</p>
<p>the ability to pick up this pen, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an instruction clearly, there&rsquo;s a motor command,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just one way of looking at it.</p>
<p>The way it actually works is that there&rsquo;s a premotor system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already generating that movement.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve done is we flung open the gate</p>
<p>and allowed that movement to occur precisely.</p>
<p>Surfing it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Surfing that current or this current or another current</p>
<p>or opening the window.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And if you look at the formal study</p>
<p>of movement and improvement of movement,</p>
<p>the most basic example I can give is like a tennis serve.</p>
<p>And they, if you just, they&rsquo;ve done this many times over,</p>
<p>you map the trajectories and in a novice,</p>
<p>the lines are all over the place.</p>
<p>It ends up looking more like a tangle of rubber band ball.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Whereas in the fetter or the expert,</p>
<p>you almost wonder if it&rsquo;s just one line being drawn,</p>
<p>but the trajectories are incredibly stereotyped.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reflection of one little narrow gate opening</p>
<p>again and again and again.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Let me inject something here from an old neurologist,</p>
<p>you can say, Bernstein, the Soviet.</p>
<p>And he talked about degrees of freedom</p>
<p>and they did in order to increase productivity</p>
<p>in Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard this story.</p>
<p>He was brought in to examine the movement habits</p>
<p>of the workers and he collected some information.</p>
<p>He placed, he was one of the first kinetic,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s called in English,</p>
<p>the kinetic capturing of motion with moving pictures</p>
<p>in that time.</p>
<p>And so he placed these thoughts and they took these photos,</p>
<p>which became kind of moving.</p>
<p>And what he discovered was something very interesting.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the heat of the sledgehammer</p>
<p>increased while the variance in the various points</p>
<p>became more, not less.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a fixed pattern.</p>
<p>It was a meta pattern.</p>
<p>And this pattern is adjusted in this way</p>
<p>to achieve the perfect execution.</p>
<p>Those were very early findings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how does that sit with everything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure there is some truth to it from my experience.</p>
<p>Basically, the self-adjusting dynamic nature of the system</p>
<p>allows you to reach a very constant and stable end result</p>
<p>by being so open and letting go of your control.</p>
<p>The example you give fits very well</p>
<p>with the one that I described before,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m recalling the experiment.</p>
<p>If people want to look this up, it&rsquo;s a paper.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put it in the show note caption.</p>
<p>A guy also happens to be at Harvard named Bence Olevski,</p>
<p>a Hungarian, I&rsquo;m clearly pronouncing his name wrong,</p>
<p>but I know Bence.</p>
<p>And I remember the slide in my mind&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p>and the trajectory that was mapped</p>
<p>was the movement of the tennis racket,</p>
<p>not of the limbs themselves in the Federer case.</p>
<p>So that I think aligns well with what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>Yeah, that exploration of degrees of freedom</p>
<p>is where the opportunity for real advancement</p>
<p>and expansion of skill shows up.</p>
<p>I think the way it&rsquo;s been described to me</p>
<p>is that we go from unskilled to skilled,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s mastery, and then there&rsquo;s this top tier,</p>
<p>which is this beautiful thin layer</p>
<p>that so few people occupy, which is virtuosity,</p>
<p>in which the practitioner invites variability</p>
<p>and chance back in as an opportunity to do truly new things.</p>
<p>It made me think many years ago,</p>
<p>this kind of thinking about, so what is that entity?</p>
<p>Because obviously it&rsquo;s not technique.</p>
<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t even be honest to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a movement pattern.</p>
<p>There is too much diversity there.</p>
<p>I started to talk about, I called it movement sleeves</p>
<p>or meta-technique.</p>
<p>But the word technique is already misleading.</p>
<p>So there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve</p>
<p>in which you can move.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re not out of this sleeve,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still within the boundaries</p>
<p>of achieving the result that you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>And then there is all this adaptation</p>
<p>of all these elements inside to keep you in the sleeve.</p>
<p>The sleeve is not constricted as we once thought.</p>
<p>Oh, beautiful technique.</p>
<p>There are many ways to skin a cat.</p>
<p>And that experience and that variety,</p>
<p>that diversity goes into virtuosity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true freedom because your focus is on the right thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t point at the moon, look at your finger.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really in essence,</p>
<p>being a virtuoso for me, like mastery.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>I do believe there is such a thing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll flatter and attempt to embarrass you</p>
<p>by saying I think that I&rsquo;m not alone</p>
<p>in viewing you as a virtuoso of movement.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what comes to mind</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this notion</p>
<p>that not everything is pre-planned,</p>
<p>that even you might not know what you&rsquo;re going to do next</p>
<p>until the moment of execution.</p>
<p>But that here I&rsquo;m projecting my own assumptions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about mindsets</p>
<p>in approaching practice a little bit more,</p>
<p>but I want to wade into that territory</p>
<p>by talking about vision in the eyes,</p>
<p>something that we both share a deep interest in.</p>
<p>From the background of visual neuroscience,</p>
<p>but also from the realization</p>
<p>that we have this incredible ability</p>
<p>to adjust the aperture of our visual window.</p>
<p>We can focus very narrowly or we can focus very broadly.</p>
<p>So something I encountered, I think first as a child,</p>
<p>realizing that I could spend all day</p>
<p>watching ants play in a very fine domain</p>
<p>and then look up and go inside</p>
<p>and realize there&rsquo;s a whole world</p>
<p>and realizing, wow, I&rsquo;ll never be able</p>
<p>to consume the full range of experiences.</p>
<p>At any one moment,</p>
<p>there are ants probably in the corner of this room</p>
<p>doing their thing.</p>
<p>And so too, our approach to movement can be,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, very big and dynamic</p>
<p>in terms of the broad movements of our limbs</p>
<p>or fine articulation.</p>
<p>When you begin a practice</p>
<p>and as you move through a practice,</p>
<p>do you apply a regimented way of focusing your vision?</p>
<p>Are you in panoramic vision?</p>
<p>Are you in a very narrow field of view?</p>
<p>Or does it entirely depend?</p>
<p>And for the person who&rsquo;s a true beginner,</p>
<p>a true novice like myself,</p>
<p>how should I show up to the practice with my eyes?</p>
<p>The eyes are a good starting point</p>
<p>as you help a lot of people to understand.</p>
<p>And when you encounter difficulties with other layers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very powerful to start with the eyes.</p>
<p>Another thing important to understand and to experience,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t believe me or you got to examine it for yourself.</p>
<p>We do not move the eyes as well as we think we do.</p>
<p>Because as long as you can see and move the eyes,</p>
<p>people never think about it,</p>
<p>that it can be trained, that it can be improved, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the effects of it are far reaching.</p>
<p>The eyes lead to the inner eye.</p>
<p>You can think of it in a beautiful metaphorical way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a representation of the way</p>
<p>that we use various cognitive and mind processes.</p>
<p>And also, of course, affect the body.</p>
<p>The eyes lead in many ways.</p>
<p>And the head is also a very,</p>
<p>because all of these inputs are coming in here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very easy to lead the body</p>
<p>if you look at the centered way from the head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very powerful and easy thing.</p>
<p>For example, when you teach boxers how to bob,</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s not done in the way</p>
<p>that I believe it should be done.</p>
<p>You teach it with the periphery.</p>
<p>They teach it from the feet.</p>
<p>Because they have the idea, which is correct,</p>
<p>that you need to do it in spatial conditions,</p>
<p>in movement, in space.</p>
<p>But in reality, the head will organize the feet for you.</p>
<p>Instead, you are now putting two elements together.</p>
<p>And then with years of practice,</p>
<p>you hope of tying them together well.</p>
<p>I prefer to do something else</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;ll pull your head now to the side,</p>
<p>you will immediately start to organize your feet under you.</p>
<p>So I give you just one element to manipulate the system from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I would teach someone something like this.</p>
<p>Many animals hunt with the head.</p>
<p>So you can see the body running forward</p>
<p>while the head is turning to the side.</p>
<p>The whole thing follows afterwards.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very powerful way to address movement.</p>
<p>Not the only one.</p>
<p>There are many modes, thankfully,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re very adaptable in that.</p>
<p>But definitely a primary one.</p>
<p>And then the use of the eyes is, of course,</p>
<p>maybe the most important element with that, usually.</p>
<p>Yeah, what else can I say about the eyes?</p>
<p>How do you come in?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on the practice.</p>
<p>You need to start to have some kind of a checklist</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re looking to do.</p>
<p>And then by this,</p>
<p>you can start to tailor the way that you use your eyes.</p>
<p>The same thing I do for posture.</p>
<p>The same thing I do for stance.</p>
<p>The same thing eventually I do for state.</p>
<p>And there is different flavors.</p>
<p>There is no correct way to use the eyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s very peripheral,</p>
<p>soft, open, awareness, orientation.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s very focused.</p>
<p>Notice that I&rsquo;m pulling these two opposites,</p>
<p>awareness and focus,</p>
<p>which is often put together and confused.</p>
<p>And then the eyes are the immediate</p>
<p>and the easiest entry point into that.</p>
<p>Another thing is the placement of the head and the eyes.</p>
<p>Like, for example, when we lower our chin,</p>
<p>we seem to see better.</p>
<p>When we raise the eyebrows,</p>
<p>there is too much exposure of top light sources.</p>
<p>And so people would usually,</p>
<p>when looking into the distance,</p>
<p>will tilt their chin in.</p>
<p>And in many scenarios,</p>
<p>tilting of the chin to the side</p>
<p>or placing just like listening with the ear,</p>
<p>placing a certain eye or dominant eye,</p>
<p>depending on various scenarios.</p>
<p>And this is all like information</p>
<p>that I can come in cerebrally</p>
<p>and think about and jump my practice forward,</p>
<p>instead of just letting the experience teach me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m using some kind of a thinking process to improve.</p>
<p>And this is not cheating.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Will it work?</p>
<p>We got to try.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>Those are some thoughts to start to play with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love that you mentioned chin down</p>
<p>because we all have a natural reflex.</p>
<p>When chin goes down, eyes goes up.</p>
<p>And the opposite is true.</p>
<p>When head goes up, eyes go down.</p>
<p>And there are two separate clusters of neurons</p>
<p>in these cranial nerve nuclei that, as we call them,</p>
<p>when eyes are up,</p>
<p>it increases our level of alertness overall.</p>
<p>This is not, you know, this is not woo science.</p>
<p>This is the function of these cranial nerve nuclei.</p>
<p>When our eyes are down,</p>
<p>we go into states of more calm and quiescence.</p>
<p>And this makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And then the eyelids usually go down</p>
<p>and then people fall asleep.</p>
<p>Eyes up does not mean head up.</p>
<p>Because as you said, there&rsquo;s a very dynamic control</p>
<p>over the amount of luminance, depending on the environment.</p>
<p>So that, and then as you mentioned,</p>
<p>this difference between focus and awareness,</p>
<p>I think is a really important one.</p>
<p>When we are in this more panoramic soft gaze</p>
<p>and broad awareness, big swaths of visual field, as we say,</p>
<p>the neurons that control that come through a pathway</p>
<p>called magnocellular pathway.</p>
<p>In any event, those neurons are much thicker,</p>
<p>thicker cables.</p>
<p>They transmit much faster,</p>
<p>just like thick pipes can carry more water more quickly.</p>
<p>And your reaction time is at least four times</p>
<p>what it is in this awareness mode</p>
<p>than it is when you&rsquo;re narrowly focused on something.</p>
<p>And this is counterintuitive, I think, to a lot of people.</p>
<p>But the person who is running to catch the ball</p>
<p>is not tracking the ball in a smooth movement.</p>
<p>Most of their vision is in peripheral vision.</p>
<p>When we drive, we&rsquo;re in this peripheral vision</p>
<p>and our reaction times are much, much faster.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m reluctant to encourage people</p>
<p>to shift toward a particular type of practice,</p>
<p>toward a particular type of vision.</p>
<p>I think what you and I, I hope agree on,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>is that exploring these different extremes</p>
<p>and everything in between is where the real value is.</p>
<p>Panoramic, focused, eyes, head up, eyes down,</p>
<p>head down, eyes up, playing with it and exploring it</p>
<p>as opposed to, for the first 10 minutes of practice,</p>
<p>be in panoramic vision.</p>
<p>You know, the sort of, earlier today we were joking about</p>
<p>and kind of lamenting the fact</p>
<p>that this word biohacking exists</p>
<p>or that the optimal performance,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re unfortunate terms</p>
<p>because they suggest that if you just plug it in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be like two plus two equals four</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna get it right every time.</p>
<p>Another pragmatic beat here, if I can offer,</p>
<p>is since our culture has been more geared</p>
<p>and pushing us towards focus,</p>
<p>the focus use of the eyes and primary language,</p>
<p>reading and other things,</p>
<p>we have less opportunities to work</p>
<p>with the more open panoramic one.</p>
<p>So it would be smart to start</p>
<p>to balance things out a bit more.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in nature, you don&rsquo;t look at each leaf.</p>
<p>Everything is moving and you are kind of immersed in that.</p>
<p>And then something attracts your attention.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a bird.</p>
<p>And you focus and you go back into the general state,</p>
<p>the basic state, which is open awareness.</p>
<p>Here, we switch things around.</p>
<p>In our modern culture, we are mostly focused</p>
<p>and then we sanitize daydream,</p>
<p>which is maybe some kind of a balancing act</p>
<p>that comes from deep within.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can share</p>
<p>some information about that.</p>
<p>But I see that many times people need to,</p>
<p>the focus is overly done by far in our lives.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of, I&rsquo;ll even venture so far as to say</p>
<p>that a lot of the visual deficits</p>
<p>that we now see in young people,</p>
<p>myopia, literally nearsightedness,</p>
<p>occurs because if we look at things</p>
<p>that are too close to us as children or as adults,</p>
<p>the eyeball actually gets longer.</p>
<p>The lens focuses the visual image in front</p>
<p>of nearer to the lens, nearsighted,</p>
<p>than in front of where it should land.</p>
<p>And basically, it&rsquo;s a lack of panoramic vision</p>
<p>that is, or open awareness that&rsquo;s driving these changes.</p>
<p>And nowadays, we are essentially,</p>
<p>most people are 90% of the time in this narrow focus mode.</p>
<p>You know, right before recording,</p>
<p>we took a break and went up to look at a vista</p>
<p>and to look off to the distance.</p>
<p>Incredibly useful, easy practice at some level,</p>
<p>but I think most people are not doing this sort of thing.</p>
<p>And the way that it shapes the mind</p>
<p>and the perception of time, of course,</p>
<p>is a whole other kingdom of ideas.</p>
<p>But one thing I&rsquo;d like to relate this element of vision to</p>
<p>and open awareness is earlier,</p>
<p>you mentioned the cone of auditory attention,</p>
<p>the other sense that we can play with in our practice</p>
<p>and throughout the day.</p>
<p>Do you see any value to both paying attention to things</p>
<p>in a very narrow cone of auditory attention,</p>
<p>but also just walking and listening</p>
<p>to all the sounds at once?</p>
<p>I could imagine that could be useful.</p>
<p>And in terms of physical movement practices,</p>
<p>I was gonna say, where are your ears?</p>
<p>Your ears are always more or less in the same place,</p>
<p>but where is your hearing when you approach your practice?</p>
<p>Another set of parameters to think about</p>
<p>and to play with and to be aware of.</p>
<p>And also I have the experience that some people</p>
<p>are better at using this system or that system.</p>
<p>And you would be amazed how differently</p>
<p>the same results, seemingly outside results</p>
<p>are done by different practitioners</p>
<p>and in different scenarios.</p>
<p>This goes into this mutation and change ideas.</p>
<p>What really jumps us forward eventually</p>
<p>is some kind of a mutation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like all of our culture and practices</p>
<p>and success puts us closer and closer to each other.</p>
<p>So we have the same opinions everywhere around the world</p>
<p>becoming more and more the same, less and less different,</p>
<p>but the real hope comes from the different.</p>
<p>So, and we have a difficulty in promoting that.</p>
<p>And so this is another thing that can be promoted</p>
<p>with the right practices, the right, for example,</p>
<p>I work with corporates or even worked with governments</p>
<p>before to bring in some of that freshness</p>
<p>with simple habits in the workday</p>
<p>or in the education of children or in companies,</p>
<p>increasing productivity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really give a fuck,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m there to give what I view is important.</p>
<p>And what is important maybe increases productivity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more important to me that it improves</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s lives who are involved and improves,</p>
<p>yeah, being and becoming.</p>
<p>Being and becoming is two, these two entities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on my way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a process.</p>
<p>So thinking about here,</p>
<p>the way that people use their ears,</p>
<p>the way that people use listening,</p>
<p>again, we can talk about placement of the head and posture</p>
<p>sometimes angling as well, sharper angle, chin down.</p>
<p>Some people tend to use the shape of the ear,</p>
<p>people with different ears closer or further out.</p>
<p>This is, if you&rsquo;re very sensitive</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking around,</p>
<p>you would see this is affecting people&rsquo;s motion.</p>
<p>Even the shape of our face,</p>
<p>like the development of the vocal cords and speaking</p>
<p>will totally change how we look,</p>
<p>but how we listen also will do the same.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any proof of it,</p>
<p>but it is something I believe in.</p>
<p>Well, people will even make their ears bigger, right?</p>
<p>We try and become like little fennec foxes</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually why we do this</p>
<p>is to capture more sound waves, right?</p>
<p>And the leaning is that the localization of sound</p>
<p>is based on a simple brainstem calculation</p>
<p>of interaural time differences,</p>
<p>the time in which something,</p>
<p>the brain intuitively just knows</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a pretty hardwired circuit</p>
<p>that if a sound arrives first to this ear, then that ear,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s likely coming from over here.</p>
<p>Whereas if it&rsquo;s dead center arrives</p>
<p>at the two of the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost, you know, ridiculously simple</p>
<p>when one hears it, no pun intended,</p>
<p>but it is an incredibly valuable way of thinking</p>
<p>about how the architecture of the body</p>
<p>changes our experience.</p>
<p>I want to, along those lines,</p>
<p>earlier you mentioned something</p>
<p>and it flagged an important question for me.</p>
<p>When I see people walking,</p>
<p>I sometimes, you know, sometimes I think,</p>
<p>wow, they really move in a strange way.</p>
<p>Occasionally you see somebody and they walk really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impressive for whatever reason, you know,</p>
<p>and you just think, wow, they sort of glide along.</p>
<p>People come in different shapes and sizes,</p>
<p>short torsos, long arms, et cetera.</p>
<p>Do you think that if people have a body type</p>
<p>that facilitates certain kinds of movement and not others,</p>
<p>that they should intentionally try and move in the way</p>
<p>that is right at the edge of the kind of friction</p>
<p>and challenge in order to shape new possibilities?</p>
<p>Or do you think that they should lean</p>
<p>into the smooth execution</p>
<p>of what comes most naturally to them?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a good practice is to have many walks</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re required.</p>
<p>And of course there is a very efficient</p>
<p>and endurance stamina oriented thing</p>
<p>that if you have the experience,</p>
<p>it will naturally develop and unravel.</p>
<p>And if not, you can get some collective knowledge</p>
<p>and improve.</p>
<p>And then there is a lot of emotional things related to walk</p>
<p>like how I&rsquo;m walking into a business meeting</p>
<p>and, or how I&rsquo;m walking out of a bad situation.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of beautiful things to research there,</p>
<p>practically with yourself,</p>
<p>trying to approach someone with the chin slightly down,</p>
<p>very linear, very efficient in the straightest line,</p>
<p>or trying to approach someone a little bit more rounded</p>
<p>from the side and tilting your head</p>
<p>and you will see totally different results,</p>
<p>totally different communication</p>
<p>that happens over people&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re sensitive,</p>
<p>you realize that, wow, this opened the door.</p>
<p>Instead, many people you start on the minus</p>
<p>and my sister, my big sister, Tali,</p>
<p>she always says, I started on the minus.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I start on the zero with them?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s part of the approach.</p>
<p>You can affect that.</p>
<p>And you can start even on the plus</p>
<p>if you are the sly man as the practitioner needs to be.</p>
<p>So this is something to play with and to work with.</p>
<p>And then you have, of course, body proportions and ways.</p>
<p>And we have all these like technical invasions,</p>
<p>mathematics and trigonometry and architecture.</p>
<p>They invaded our bodies.</p>
<p>They invaded our nervous system.</p>
<p>And now our walk and our physical practices,</p>
<p>they look linear and efficient.</p>
<p>The path between two points is a straight line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>This is biomechanics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mechanics.</p>
<p>Nothing there is a given.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no gospel.</p>
<p>So the walk is sometimes have to go around</p>
<p>or sway from side to side.</p>
<p>And there is coiling, uncoiling, and there are moving bits.</p>
<p>And what about the coordination of my breathing</p>
<p>with my walk?</p>
<p>Because if I walk too linearly,</p>
<p>there is less pumping of the air naturally in and out.</p>
<p>So now I have to forcefully bring it in and out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wasteful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you see in last years,</p>
<p>these incredible runners, especially in long distance,</p>
<p>doing things we never thought were possible</p>
<p>in the worst possible way that we used to think.</p>
<p>Pronation and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Like our technical thoughts were totally misguided</p>
<p>and wrong.</p>
<p>And then somebody comes in and does it in some way</p>
<p>that is totally wrong.</p>
<p>And he gets results we could never get.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beauty of playfulness, experimentation,</p>
<p>change, being different.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re describing this, I&rsquo;m smiling</p>
<p>because one of my favorite neuroscientists,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s out of the University of Chicago, was in a meeting.</p>
<p>There was an argument about evolution of the nervous system.</p>
<p>And he said, at the end, and people were arguing</p>
<p>about whether or not this gene in one animal</p>
<p>was homologous to this gene in humans, et cetera.</p>
<p>It can get very dicey.</p>
<p>And he said very, very appropriately</p>
<p>that one of the major jobs of evolution</p>
<p>is to take existing cell types and circuits</p>
<p>and give them new functions.</p>
<p>But that can only be done through the playful exploration</p>
<p>of new possibilities, which I think maps very well</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re saying, that at the extreme thresholds</p>
<p>of technical execution, mastery, mastery, mastery,</p>
<p>your obviously performance is very high,</p>
<p>but the opportunity for evolution of the sport</p>
<p>or the music or the dance or the intellectual endeavors</p>
<p>is limited because you&rsquo;re not introducing variability.</p>
<p>In the attempt to get proper execution,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re limiting oneself.</p>
<p>And hence, I want to offer something</p>
<p>that is relating to you.</p>
<p>We should be wary of defining the mechanisms</p>
<p>and putting certain meaning with certain processes and ways</p>
<p>because just history and experience shows</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work well for us most times.</p>
<p>Or it becomes like this much more elaborate thing,</p>
<p>even if we were somewhat in the right direction.</p>
<p>Because even thinking this way can offer a lot.</p>
<p>Like for example, your advice about heat, dopamine, light</p>
<p>offers a lot of benefit, but also can create problems.</p>
<p>And it can enclose something.</p>
<p>Which the improviser will find, the MacGyvers, right?</p>
<p>Like take some paper clip and you make it</p>
<p>into something great.</p>
<p>And this is really our, we are the biggest improvisers</p>
<p>around, like that&rsquo;s what made us who we are.</p>
<p>I think this is incredible what we can do with it.</p>
<p>You know, the Russian-American space exploration story</p>
<p>with the space pen, famous story</p>
<p>about the development of the space pen.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a space pen?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know about this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an urban myth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true, but I like it.</p>
<p>So I use it.</p>
<p>So there was this, of course, space competition</p>
<p>and the Russians put the first animal in space.</p>
<p>And the first-</p>
<p>I think it was a macaque monkey or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then Laika and they put the first Sputnik,</p>
<p>the satellite and man in space,</p>
<p>but Americans took the man on the moon.</p>
<p>And on the way, a lot of technologies got developed</p>
<p>and the Americans, because of lack of gravity out there,</p>
<p>developed the space pen with a huge investment.</p>
<p>The Russians used the pencil.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is, but it represents something</p>
<p>in the state of mind.</p>
<p>Like you look at, for example,</p>
<p>the military equipment in Soviet equipment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all can do multiple things.</p>
<p>And it means that it&rsquo;s heavier, it&rsquo;s less efficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as light.</p>
<p>But even the Navy SEALs will still carry an AK</p>
<p>with certain conditions.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you can pour a whole bucket of sand</p>
<p>into the mechanism and it will keep running.</p>
<p>While the most advanced German Heckler and Koch</p>
<p>and accurate and light weapons,</p>
<p>for every grain can get stuck and overly specialized.</p>
<p>And there is something about this openness</p>
<p>that we humans need to keep.</p>
<p>And also maybe something for our leaders</p>
<p>to be more of less specialist and more in this openness,</p>
<p>less capable in this or that way,</p>
<p>but more capable of doing the whole thing.</p>
<p>I love the story.</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s a legend or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s legendary because it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>As we say in the laboratory,</p>
<p>whenever someone takes on a project in my lab,</p>
<p>I always say, you have to ask yourself</p>
<p>how much technical detail and challenge you wanna take on</p>
<p>because with more technology, advanced technology,</p>
<p>yes, there&rsquo;s the opportunity for more discovery,</p>
<p>but more downtime.</p>
<p>Your PhD will literally take longer</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna use a microscope that&rsquo;s out of commission</p>
<p>30% of the time.</p>
<p>And you just have to understand that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a dynamic interplay there.</p>
<p>By the way, I think that scientists get it right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where you transmit the knowledge</p>
<p>out of the scientific field</p>
<p>because science have debate and everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not so connected.</p>
<p>Of course, this can happen as well,</p>
<p>but then when it goes out</p>
<p>and the simple person without the experience</p>
<p>takes it more as a gospel, as a fixed thing.</p>
<p>And then it was just a report.</p>
<p>It was just reporting some functions here and play with it.</p>
<p>See what it does for you.</p>
<p>Because with all the greatest information that I can give,</p>
<p>the person will examine it</p>
<p>and it might be not useful at all for him.</p>
<p>This is the practitioner.</p>
<p>Make it your own.</p>
<p>Go practice, try.</p>
<p>Heat, cold, light, movement,</p>
<p>awareness to this, awareness to this.</p>
<p>And this is up to you to make it yours,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t like to have this responsibility.</p>
<p>No, people prefer to have the,</p>
<p>this will work the first time every time</p>
<p>and will serve you best compared to everything else.</p>
<p>And while there are more reliable tools than others,</p>
<p>in my mind, the more reliable tools</p>
<p>tend to be ones that are grounded in our innate physiology,</p>
<p>as opposed to some, I don&rsquo;t like the word hack.</p>
<p>In fact, I loathe the word biohack</p>
<p>as we were talking about again earlier,</p>
<p>because the hack in my mind is something</p>
<p>that is designed for one purpose that&rsquo;s used for another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the most efficient use of that tool,</p>
<p>nor is it naturally the best solution.</p>
<p>Whereas biology has some very good solutions,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t always work, not every time.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we did a practice in which,</p>
<p>which involved invasion, shall we say,</p>
<p>of peripersonal space.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t standing super close for any particular reason,</p>
<p>but there was-</p>
<p>God forbid.</p>
<p>God forbid.</p>
<p>But we, but there was, we were close enough together</p>
<p>we could touch one&rsquo;s torsos,</p>
<p>and we were doing that as part of this practice.</p>
<p>And you encouraged me to pay attention to,</p>
<p>how does it feel to have someone</p>
<p>in your peripersonal space?</p>
<p>And then this notion of reactivity.</p>
<p>I find this an immensely interesting</p>
<p>and potentially powerful practice,</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people,</p>
<p>I know a lot of people suffer from anxiety</p>
<p>just being in a face-to-face conversation.</p>
<p>Some people have a lot of anxiety</p>
<p>about being physically close to people,</p>
<p>whether or not they know them or not.</p>
<p>And many people are reactive.</p>
<p>They are in that anticipatory state</p>
<p>of something is going to happen.</p>
<p>And sometimes this relates to trauma</p>
<p>and negative experience, but sometimes no.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re just not used to being in dynamic,</p>
<p>excuse me, exchange with other beings.</p>
<p>And so one thing that I love about the movement practice</p>
<p>and how dynamic is that one can explore that space.</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk about that a little bit more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Touch, proximity, all these things also taking very,</p>
<p>it takes a very, I think, limited place in our lives.</p>
<p>People are not touched and they don&rsquo;t touch enough.</p>
<p>There is certain bubbles of peripersonal space,</p>
<p>according to culture, according to environment,</p>
<p>what is right, what is wrong.</p>
<p>And then came all the, of course,</p>
<p>politically correctness and harassment and all kinds.</p>
<p>And this is a problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem to navigate all this scenario.</p>
<p>And I think we are, there is definitely this side,</p>
<p>which is suffering.</p>
<p>People go to BJJ classes to touch, not to learn BJJ.</p>
<p>Most of it, they&rsquo;re not even aware of it.</p>
<p>Before they would go to a prostitute, maybe.</p>
<p>It would not be honest to say that,</p>
<p>yeah, this is not required or necessary more in our lives.</p>
<p>And children who are not touched,</p>
<p>there is a lot of information about that and the problems,</p>
<p>but adults who are not touched,</p>
<p>there is not a lot of information.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s no less of a problem</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something that has to be constantly present.</p>
<p>And then proximity, being able to, as you said,</p>
<p>remove certain reactivity and to learn to control</p>
<p>that volume control over how reactive I am,</p>
<p>and in other scenarios,</p>
<p>how do I remove this reactivity altogether</p>
<p>is very important for performance and also for our lives,</p>
<p>for clear thinking, et cetera,</p>
<p>because everything is moving through us</p>
<p>and is being monitored by us.</p>
<p>So everything has the potential to detract us</p>
<p>from a certain direction of exploration.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re reactive, you&rsquo;re a slave.</p>
<p>It becomes worse and worse and worse.</p>
<p>Or for example, a fighter or a football player, et cetera,</p>
<p>has to know what to take, what not to take.</p>
<p>The fact that you can sense more</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you should react to it.</p>
<p>And the practice helps that</p>
<p>by bringing people into these scenarios,</p>
<p>but oftentimes disarming them.</p>
<p>Like when we were working closely today,</p>
<p>and because you have a certain background</p>
<p>with boxing or fighting,</p>
<p>I can tell you, you are missing some kind of a way</p>
<p>to be in that space that is not martial.</p>
<p>So you carry a certain tone,</p>
<p>although you&rsquo;re a very kind person,</p>
<p>but oftentimes you held me without realizing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re holding me with a lot of strength, for example.</p>
<p>And it just, it was clear to me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not fully aware of what is unfolding.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, of course, a question of experience.</p>
<p>So to be able to be in this scenario,</p>
<p>but do something else,</p>
<p>which is not geared towards winning, losing competition,</p>
<p>or just being able to play with another person.</p>
<p>Like for example, contact improvisation,</p>
<p>took that and played with that.</p>
<p>And the work of Steve Paxton</p>
<p>for the ones who are not familiar.</p>
<p>So this is where I call it</p>
<p>the hybrids become very useful.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t, when you are practicing</p>
<p>in this open way,</p>
<p>you are not bound by specific rule set</p>
<p>or ways of doing things.</p>
<p>It can be a fight, but it can be a dance a moment after.</p>
<p>Another thing that I learned from Capoeira,</p>
<p>the situation is very tricky there</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen kids doing cartwheels in Brazil</p>
<p>and scissors fall from their pockets.</p>
<p>Why would you go to with a scissor in your pocket?</p>
<p>Obviously there is certain intentions.</p>
<p>And then at other times you see back flips</p>
<p>and beautiful things,</p>
<p>but people die in Capoeira every year.</p>
<p>Neck breaks or something.</p>
<p>Kicks to the face, trauma, various violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve explored other martial arts and boxing.</p>
<p>I was involved with MMA and BJJ,</p>
<p>but I tell you the most violent arena is that.</p>
<p>Why? Because it&rsquo;s unknown.</p>
<p>One moment it&rsquo;s smiles.</p>
<p>Another moment it&rsquo;s something else and it&rsquo;s uncontrolled.</p>
<p>There is no categories, no weights,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a street phenomenon.</p>
<p>So you have musical instruments.</p>
<p>Sometimes they break it on your head.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t see that,</p>
<p>but you can look online on YouTube</p>
<p>and see some of that side of Capoeira,</p>
<p>which is actually the day to day in Brazil</p>
<p>and the reality and how things unfolded.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important to explore many ways of being</p>
<p>within different distances and spaces from other people</p>
<p>and touched in different ways</p>
<p>and not contextualizing it always in the same way.</p>
<p>I can touch your chest in one way.</p>
<p>I can touch it with the exact same pressure and speed,</p>
<p>but it will feel very different.</p>
<p>The parameters, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Certain intentions,</p>
<p>certain combination of postures or ways.</p>
<p>And this is beautiful exploration.</p>
<p>Again, I would encourage you and others</p>
<p>to explore the discomfort.</p>
<p>For example, certain discomfort to be with a man</p>
<p>in certain scenario or with a woman</p>
<p>and trying to see what is that.</p>
<p>Because if we&rsquo;re truly strong,</p>
<p>we are not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>If we truly know who we are and we are in that exploration,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know the end result, but we are in a research</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re not afraid of being in that or this</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t come out of boundaries</p>
<p>and this will improve our culture tremendously.</p>
<p>Of course, there must be agreement.</p>
<p>You never force yourself,</p>
<p>but you meet someone who is also interested</p>
<p>in that exploration and then you do it.</p>
<p>And there are many scenarios to do that</p>
<p>with traditional practices like learning to grapple</p>
<p>or going to contact improvisation and studying there</p>
<p>or going to dance, to Latin dance class.</p>
<p>And there is, of course, my favorite is to create</p>
<p>and to come up with your own hybrids of that and scenarios.</p>
<p>Communicating with your loved one through movement,</p>
<p>not sitting around food and talking.</p>
<p>Moving together in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s walking together</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s all kinds of, it can be game, playful.</p>
<p>It can be romantic and there are many shades.</p>
<p>Sex doesn&rsquo;t start here and end here, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like continuum and we don&rsquo;t even need to define it</p>
<p>in that way.</p>
<p>So with time, I think it unlocks a lot of things.</p>
<p>People become much stronger in a good sense,</p>
<p>in sense of becoming, being, and we abuse less</p>
<p>and we can approach, yeah, other aspects to us.</p>
<p>I love the idea that through the exploration</p>
<p>of a range of physical contacts,</p>
<p>provided one knows they can always return to their center,</p>
<p>so to speak, then there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity</p>
<p>that opens up.</p>
<p>I wish there was more of that encouraged in children&rsquo;s play,</p>
<p>but also, as you mentioned, in adult environments</p>
<p>because yeah, nowadays for all sorts of reasons</p>
<p>that you touched on, the idea of keeping at least</p>
<p>an arm&rsquo;s length distance has become critical.</p>
<p>There are a lot of environments actually</p>
<p>where hugging is not allowed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like in Israel,</p>
<p>but in the States, many institutions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to touch anyone else&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a wonderful study that comes to mind</p>
<p>from an Israeli laboratory, a guy named Noam Sobel,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s over there, who has shown that</p>
<p>by recording people&rsquo;s first interactions,</p>
<p>that when people meet, if they shake hands,</p>
<p>they almost always, I think it&rsquo;s greater than 85%</p>
<p>of the time, they will then wipe the chemicals</p>
<p>from the other person onto their own eyes,</p>
<p>typically their eyes or their face.</p>
<p>This changed a little bit during the whole pandemic thing,</p>
<p>but this is thought to be a carryover</p>
<p>from what other animals do in terms of exchanging</p>
<p>microbiome elements, exchanging chemicals,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re constantly feeding our subconscious</p>
<p>with the knowledge of the chemical constituents</p>
<p>of other people, right?</p>
<p>So it goes way beyond how people smell,</p>
<p>how they look, et cetera.</p>
<p>More touch seems to me, as you said,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s consensual, seems like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a really good thing overall.</p>
<p>And I think maybe also important for discharging,</p>
<p>discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like touch is very powerful in that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re touched and you&rsquo;re touching a lot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unpacking and you experience that touch</p>
<p>that maybe has been traumatic and you&rsquo;re reframing it,</p>
<p>you have the opportunity, which is something interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some story about some traditional culture</p>
<p>in which when you were burned by mistake,</p>
<p>they would immediately burn you again.</p>
<p>And it made me think, and then there would not be</p>
<p>any burn marks and there would not be</p>
<p>the same side effects, that&rsquo;s the claim.</p>
<p>It made me think, it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s the source of this?</p>
<p>And I realized that maybe it allows a certain completion</p>
<p>to happen that in the traumatic moment is not there.</p>
<p>So the re-exposure, while you&rsquo;re still open,</p>
<p>the pores are still open, allows you to reframe</p>
<p>the experience and then the unfolding of the rest</p>
<p>of the event is very different.</p>
<p>This is, if you&rsquo;re touching in your practice</p>
<p>in the day-to-day and you&rsquo;re working with people</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being touched and people come closer</p>
<p>or further away, it happens naturally.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you pass a certain limit</p>
<p>and it becomes too much, there is always, of course,</p>
<p>communication that has to be present.</p>
<p>Certain cultures make this communication pre,</p>
<p>certain cultures post.</p>
<p>The Israeli, for example, post, here, pre.</p>
<p>So in Israel, they&rsquo;ll say, that didn&rsquo;t feel good to me</p>
<p>or that felt good or that was fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be more common.</p>
<p>Here in the airport, the guy&rsquo;s telling me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna slide my hands up towards your crotch</p>
<p>until I meet the hard stop.</p>
<p>And then he does this in a way that is supposed</p>
<p>to show me I have no enjoyment in that.</p>
<p>And for me, it just feels aggressive.</p>
<p>But his intention is good, showing me,</p>
<p>but if it was a loving touch, it would be nicer for me.</p>
<p>Actually, personally, that&rsquo;s, it would be gentle,</p>
<p>but he goes up there and he shows me,</p>
<p>I have no enjoyment in this.</p>
<p>But, oh, that&rsquo;s my testicle right there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s different choices.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s like worse,</p>
<p>but this description can be a bit dissociated.</p>
<p>And what does it make me think?</p>
<p>Is it truly what he feels or not?</p>
<p>Because it feels robotic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, so sometimes I rather not say it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to touch your chest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just place my hand on the chest.</p>
<p>And of course we can&rsquo;t avoid the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that there is,</p>
<p>but there is an examination.</p>
<p>And because I moved around the world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen many things and I&rsquo;ve seen benefits here,</p>
<p>benefits there.</p>
<p>And in the practice, I think it&rsquo;s important to discuss this,</p>
<p>to examine this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a solution, but it&rsquo;s something to talk about.</p>
<p>It is something to talk about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad you raised it because I think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so clear to me that much of the value</p>
<p>of a movement practice involves this dynamic interaction</p>
<p>with somebody else.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, it can be performed on one&rsquo;s own</p>
<p>and practiced throughout one&rsquo;s day,</p>
<p>but the unpredictability is a key element to all of it.</p>
<p>And in bringing out all the potential that you&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>in reference to this notion of trauma and burn and reburn,</p>
<p>my colleague at Stanford, David Spiegel,</p>
<p>he works on trauma and he&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>actually on this podcast,</p>
<p>he voiced that he&rsquo;s against things like trigger warnings</p>
<p>because of the way that it puts the nervous system</p>
<p>into this state of readiness and reactivity</p>
<p>that can exacerbate problems.</p>
<p>Whereas it&rsquo;s very clear from the literature on trauma</p>
<p>and trauma relief that the way to deal with that</p>
<p>is through a controlled,</p>
<p>but clearly a controlled re-exposure to the trauma</p>
<p>in order to diminish the emotional response over time.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very clear.</p>
<p>If we avoid the thing,</p>
<p>obviously we don&rsquo;t want to re-injure ourselves</p>
<p>or re-traumatize,</p>
<p>but if one avoids the thing that makes them upset</p>
<p>over and over,</p>
<p>all it does is serve to create a heightened state</p>
<p>of readiness.</p>
<p>It crimes more trauma.</p>
<p>So I think it makes good sense.</p>
<p>I think impressions are very useful here also</p>
<p>when stepping into an area in which trauma can occur.</p>
<p>And then by going through the impression</p>
<p>that it already occurred,</p>
<p>you create some kind of a thermal layer of protection.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve already been hit when I&rsquo;m entering that space.</p>
<p>So beneficial.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ve already been touched in a way</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>if I go to a contact improvisation class.</p>
<p>And just running this scenario in your head</p>
<p>protects so well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned running scenarios in your head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been curious all day as to whether or not</p>
<p>you do visualization</p>
<p>or mental rehearsal of physical movement.</p>
<p>It seems to be a popular idea in the States.</p>
<p>People are always asking me,</p>
<p>can you just imagine a movement</p>
<p>and learn it better than were you to actually perform it?</p>
<p>My hunch based on,</p>
<p>and my understanding of the scientific literature</p>
<p>is that visualization can be useful to some extent</p>
<p>for people that are very good at visualization.</p>
<p>But for many people, it doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s nothing like real physical practice</p>
<p>to improve physical practice.</p>
<p>Yeah, the word visualization is not good, obviously.</p>
<p>It has to be experientialization.</p>
<p>In a very complete way, not just visually, of course.</p>
<p>And unless you already developed certain experience,</p>
<p>tangible experience that has benefited from feedback,</p>
<p>from outside feedback,</p>
<p>it is not a very useful thing to do.</p>
<p>And it ends up being fabrications.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re very experienced</p>
<p>and you already gained the benefit of being burnt here</p>
<p>or overextended here,</p>
<p>then you have a certain experience</p>
<p>and then you can strengthen certain aspects of it,</p>
<p>but you gotta be careful because you do not have feedback.</p>
<p>And because of the missing feedback,</p>
<p>you might develop delusions.</p>
<p>It might be that you develop a stronger patterning,</p>
<p>but ultimately this would lead you away</p>
<p>from the aliveness of the movement itself.</p>
<p>Drilling, for example.</p>
<p>Very useful to learn a general infrastructure</p>
<p>of the movement sleeve or the technique,</p>
<p>but then to dress it up, you need feedback.</p>
<p>You need it to be alive.</p>
<p>You need to receive something corrective.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>For many people, they approach movement</p>
<p>in the form of weight training or yoga or running.</p>
<p>Yoga is a bit more dynamic,</p>
<p>but fairly linear types of exercise</p>
<p>and movement, Peloton, rowing, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think most people will probably not depart</p>
<p>from those practices entirely because they like them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking about myself.</p>
<p>I like some of those very much.</p>
<p>I enjoy them.</p>
<p>But in terms of thinking about adding a movement practice</p>
<p>to one&rsquo;s already existing exercise regime,</p>
<p>I can imagine threading it throughout the day.</p>
<p>I can imagine having a dedicated movement practice.</p>
<p>One thing that I have started doing</p>
<p>on the basis of some of your teachings,</p>
<p>and I just sort of created this idea,</p>
<p>is rather than statically standing there</p>
<p>and lifting weights, actually walking</p>
<p>as I alternate repetitions.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I&rsquo;d never done a curl,</p>
<p>a bicep curl, with one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d never actually switched that up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a kind of an odd stance</p>
<p>to be standing in parallel and curling one&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a ridiculous movement when one thinks about it.</p>
<p>So I started incorporating some of that.</p>
<p>You get some strange looks in the gym,</p>
<p>but I just give them strange looks back.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts</p>
<p>about these very linear forms of exercise?</p>
<p>And do you encourage people to expand the play space,</p>
<p>as it were, for these kinds of exercise?</p>
<p>Or do you think that movement practice</p>
<p>is just best explored through three-dimensionality,</p>
<p>gravity, and maybe a stick or a ball?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely a problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s approachable.</p>
<p>People want a quick, people want a hack.</p>
<p>People want the icing.</p>
<p>There is no cake.</p>
<p>There is no cake.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like industries of icing, icing, icing on what?</p>
<p>What are you putting it on?</p>
<p>So for me, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going towards this side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I have my life.</p>
<p>Now tell me what movement practices I should pursue.</p>
<p>You are movement.</p>
<p>In essence, you are not thinking of yourself</p>
<p>in any serious way through my eyes.</p>
<p>There is a dynamic entity to you.</p>
<p>The body is a huge part of it, communicating.</p>
<p>You have genetic layers.</p>
<p>There is personalities that got developed</p>
<p>and built around the various influences,</p>
<p>but then there is also some kind of an essence,</p>
<p>something that reeks from within the cells.</p>
<p>And if you grew up in my family</p>
<p>and I grew up in your family,</p>
<p>and it would still be the same.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that I always try to think about.</p>
<p>What is that inside of me?</p>
<p>So I think these practices, they&rsquo;re very good,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not designed for the goal</p>
<p>that we think they were designed to.</p>
<p>It orients towards something else.</p>
<p>For example, yoga.</p>
<p>There is a good book called The Yoga Body,</p>
<p>which will destroy a lot of people&rsquo;s yoga practice.</p>
<p>And it goes into, how did we get to this yoga?</p>
<p>The influence of Swedish gymnastics</p>
<p>and Mongolian contortionists</p>
<p>and the Western, the West affecting it.</p>
<p>And then the ancient practice,</p>
<p>which was barely asana related posture, position.</p>
<p>So actually you said yoga is less linear.</p>
<p>Yoga is very linear, very linear these days.</p>
<p>These lines, look at all the traditional dances.</p>
<p>They look like nothing like yoga.</p>
<p>Look at Thai dance.</p>
<p>Look at Chinese dances, martial arts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all rounded, it&rsquo;s all curled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like out nature, what you see in nature</p>
<p>and the movement of the animals.</p>
<p>So where does it come from?</p>
<p>These are things to understand</p>
<p>because it designs you now, it shapes you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re placing yourself in these forces of change</p>
<p>and the streams of change.</p>
<p>And you have a good intention.</p>
<p>You just want this or that, but the joke is on us.</p>
<p>And this is, the movement practice for me</p>
<p>is first education.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start to think about this.</p>
<p>I have nothing that I can just sprinkle now,</p>
<p>some magic powder that will help resolve this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a start of a deep investigation.</p>
<p>And then some of the things, let&rsquo;s talk pragmatically</p>
<p>because what you described is not about you placing</p>
<p>the foot in front when you&rsquo;re curling,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the examination.</p>
<p>This is why it is a very good direction.</p>
<p>And then you will need another one, another one.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get stuck on that foot in front of it</p>
<p>and try to do with the eyes closed</p>
<p>or with a different head posture.</p>
<p>And you will see things arrive, unrelated things</p>
<p>because the associative mind, the thinking,</p>
<p>this relates to this, doesn&rsquo;t get to the heart of it, never.</p>
<p>So just infusing these elements like in a cup</p>
<p>will create endless combinations, possibilities</p>
<p>and a lot of discovery.</p>
<p>And this for me is humility of the practitioner.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I try like today with you, I tried various combinations</p>
<p>and oh, I discover something.</p>
<p>Oh, this is a playful approach</p>
<p>and this is a researcher approach.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to fit my truth into something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there to examine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a motive yet.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t depend on that to define myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a human being, but if I don&rsquo;t have that sense of worth,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already like geared towards, I need to do this.</p>
<p>I need to prove this.</p>
<p>I have this agenda.</p>
<p>And this is how we get all the lies in the world</p>
<p>and all the problems and difficulties.</p>
<p>So these practices, they are related to it,</p>
<p>to prove this, that, this way,</p>
<p>why we need muscles for X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>And a lot of the reported outcomes</p>
<p>are often from my places like funny.</p>
<p>I hear about something like,</p>
<p>I heard you say about gratitude practice,</p>
<p>that actually experiencing from outside</p>
<p>is if somebody else or you are receiving gratitude</p>
<p>is actually more powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, but I see why it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure everybody sees.</p>
<p>If somebody tries to feel gratitude,</p>
<p>just sit with the eyes closed or watch a movie</p>
<p>and sense the gratitude there, it would be clear to you.</p>
<p>One is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>And the other is very easy.</p>
<p>Hence, if gratitude is achieved easier this way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it works like that.</p>
<p>Although all the traditional practices are about you</p>
<p>and by challenging yourself to sense that gratitude yourself,</p>
<p>they achieve much more powerful thing.</p>
<p>But this is not the research people,</p>
<p>the people in the research.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a lot of those people.</p>
<p>So a lot of the things that can arrive to us,</p>
<p>weight training, the benefits,</p>
<p>or the way that the hormonal effects,</p>
<p>the effect over cognition, et cetera.</p>
<p>When you open a bit and you go far out,</p>
<p>you see certain things, not the truth,</p>
<p>but maybe less delusion.</p>
<p>There is nothing definite,</p>
<p>but there is something maybe more wholesome that appears.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think this is a state of exploration.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have the same thought if I already had it.</p>
<p>Why would I wanna have the same thought?</p>
<p>I already had it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna have the same practice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>I curled already in this way.</p>
<p>I want to experience something else.</p>
<p>I want to, there is a benefit to gain.</p>
<p>No, but that was better.</p>
<p>The better is better is not more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not faster.</p>
<p>Better is better.</p>
<p>And better is, we don&rsquo;t know what better is, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>Oh, this is better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more weight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one more kilo.</p>
<p>But maybe if I remove one kilo,</p>
<p>I discover something like, for example,</p>
<p>power development that has been shown</p>
<p>to gain certain benefits when you lighten the load</p>
<p>and you accelerate it more in certain conditions.</p>
<p>But who discovered it?</p>
<p>A practitioner, a met person,</p>
<p>not Verkhoshensky, Zatseorsky.</p>
<p>They reported something,</p>
<p>but it was already within the grasp of the practitioners.</p>
<p>And I think, and as a researcher, this is very powerful</p>
<p>to remind yourself this and to work with that.</p>
<p>And as a practitioner, as a living human being,</p>
<p>for everyone, I think something very useful.</p>
<p>And then those plays that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>people give you the weird looks and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yeah, I tell people, you don&rsquo;t want to be normal.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get the weird looks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re moving in a very fixed,</p>
<p>and you already know the result of that direction.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say at least that.</p>
<p>So continue to play with that,</p>
<p>continue to play, look elsewhere,</p>
<p>look at places you didn&rsquo;t look at,</p>
<p>because this is still like within the same layer,</p>
<p>one foot in front, one foot behind.</p>
<p>What happens when you do it with a smile?</p>
<p>The same workout.</p>
<p>And when you do it with a frown,</p>
<p>or what happens, breath holding or blood restrictions,</p>
<p>all this is great play.</p>
<p>And I think very beneficial to go through.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful message.</p>
<p>What I keep hearing from you over and over again</p>
<p>is that people should explore, explore, explore.</p>
<p>And listen, I want to thank you for your time today</p>
<p>first of all, for the incredible teachings</p>
<p>here at this table,</p>
<p>but also the introduction to a movement practice.</p>
<p>Although now I&rsquo;m tempted to say</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been moving my whole life.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t know that it was such a vast landscape.</p>
<p>Also that your willingness to tread out in this journey</p>
<p>that is truly unique.</p>
<p>The greatest compliment that one can give in science</p>
<p>is the one that I&rsquo;m gonna tell you now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s entirely appropriate,</p>
<p>which is we say you&rsquo;re an N of one, right?</p>
<p>And you truly are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone that has been as willing</p>
<p>to embrace existing practices, evolve them,</p>
<p>create new practices and to share so broadly</p>
<p>to really be willing to give and teach so much knowledge.</p>
<p>You know, earlier you made the mention of your goals</p>
<p>in part of being wild and wise.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here to tell you that you are both wild and wise.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today for my discussion</p>
<p>about the science and practice of movement</p>
<p>and movement culture with Ido Portal.</p>

<p>We do read all those comments.</p>
<p>Please also check out the sponsors mentioned</p>
<p>at the beginning of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Not on today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>or could derive tremendous benefit from them.</p>
<p>For that reason,</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast has decided</p>
<p>to partner with Momentus.</p>
<p>We decided to partner with Momentus because first of all,</p>
<p>they are of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, they ship anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>And third, we wanted to have one site</p>
<p>that people could go to where they could find</p>
<p>the supplements that are discussed on this podcast</p>
<p>in the various dosages and single ingredient forms</p>
<p>that we often suggest or point people to on the podcast.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements that I take</p>
<p>or that have been mentioned on the podcast,</p>
<p>please go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re listed there as well as available there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following us on social media,</p>
<p>we are Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>Both places I do short posts about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and other of which is distinct from the information</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on Twitter</p>
<p>and Huberman Lab on Instagram.</p>
<p>We also have a newsletter that many people find useful.</p>
<p>This is a completely zero cost newsletter.</p>
<p>You can find it by going to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>click on the menu and go to newsletter,</p>
<p>and you sign up with your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody,</p>
<p>and we have a very clear privacy policy listed there.</p>
<p>You can also get access at the very same site</p>
<p>to newsletters from the past</p>
<p>to see if those newsletters are indeed of interest to you.</p>
<p>We have newsletters about a toolkit for sleep, for instance,</p>
<p>or a neuroplasticity super protocol</p>
<p>that incorporates a lot of different podcast episodes</p>
<p>and themes that you might find useful.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s HubermanLab.com and go to the menu</p>
<p>and click on newsletter and sign up.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
