    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing headaches.</p>
<p>Headaches are something that everybody will suffer</p>
<p>at some point in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Of course, some people suffer from headaches</p>
<p>far more often than others.</p>
<p>And for many people,</p>
<p>headaches can be incredibly debilitating,</p>
<p>limiting their ability to work, to socialize,</p>
<p>to sleep, to exercise,</p>
<p>essentially to live life in any kind of normal way.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll soon discuss,</p>
<p>there are many different kinds of headache.</p>
<p>We have migraine headaches, tension headaches,</p>
<p>cluster headaches.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;ll review all the different types of headaches</p>
<p>and what the underlying biology</p>
<p>of each and every one of those types of headaches is,</p>
<p>as well as, fortunately,</p>
<p>the many excellent treatments that exist</p>
<p>for the different types of headache.</p>
<p>In fact, what we&rsquo;ll soon discuss</p>
<p>is that by understanding which type of headache you have</p>
<p>and a little bit about the underlying biology</p>
<p>of each different type of headache,</p>
<p>it becomes quite straightforward</p>
<p>to select the best treatment options for you</p>
<p>to, for instance, provide relief</p>
<p>from frequent and recurring tension headaches,</p>
<p>cluster headaches, even sinus headaches,</p>
<p>the sorts of headaches that are associated</p>
<p>with sinus infections and colds,</p>
<p>where the sinuses get clogged up</p>
<p>and you experience headache.</p>
<p>So while today&rsquo;s episode focuses on all aspects</p>
<p>and types of headaches,</p>
<p>it will have tremendous relevance for everybody.</p>
<p>So for those of you that experience headache</p>
<p>every once in a while,</p>
<p>or only when you&rsquo;re sick or have a sinus headache,</p>
<p>or for those of you that suffer from debilitating migraines,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s conversation actually has a bit of optimism</p>
<p>woven into it, meaning there are excellent treatments</p>
<p>for each and every one of the different types of headaches.</p>
<p>And I was quite impressed and excited to learn</p>
<p>when researching this episode</p>
<p>that the treatments for headache range from, of course,</p>
<p>prescription drug treatments</p>
<p>and over-the-counter medications</p>
<p>of the sort of type that most of us have heard about,</p>
<p>ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and so forth,</p>
<p>so-called anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>But it turns out there are many natural treatments</p>
<p>for headaches that, when compared</p>
<p>to those over-the-counter drugs,</p>
<p>and even some prescription drugs,</p>
<p>appear to be easily as effective,</p>
<p>and in many cases, more effective,</p>
<p>than the typical drug treatments,</p>
<p>many of which can carry side effects.</p>
<p>That is, the drug treatments carry side effects,</p>
<p>whereas the natural treatments</p>
<p>appear to not carry side effects.</p>
<p>Now, of course, anytime we have a discussion</p>
<p>about natural treatments,</p>
<p>there are likely to be some eye rolls out there</p>
<p>and people thinking, oh, you know,</p>
<p>this is going to be a bunch of woo science.</p>
<p>Well, far from it.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon learn today,</p>
<p>each and every one of the treatments</p>
<p>for each and every one of the different kinds of headaches</p>
<p>is grounded in a solid biological understanding</p>
<p>of why that particular treatment ought to work</p>
<p>and does work.</p>
<p>So for instance, you&rsquo;ll learn that some headache arises</p>
<p>because of muscular pain,</p>
<p>other headache arises because of excessive vasodilation.</p>
<p>The arteries and blood vessels get bigger and wider,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a pressure and a swelling</p>
<p>within the cranium that people experience as a headache.</p>
<p>And it turns out that many of the more natural treatments</p>
<p>out there can address either the muscular pain issue</p>
<p>or the vasodilation issue or other issues</p>
<p>and underlying mechanisms for headache.</p>
<p>So again, while headaches are very intrusive,</p>
<p>irritating, and in some cases, debilitating,</p>
<p>there is certainly light at the end of this tunnel,</p>
<p>meaning by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>each and every one of you will have an array</p>
<p>of excellent treatment options that you can choose from</p>
<p>in order to address and provide relief</p>
<p>from any of the different types of headache.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes custom nootropics.</p>
<p>And as many of you know, I&rsquo;m not a fan</p>
<p>of the word nootropics because nootropics means smart drugs.</p>
<p>And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you,</p>
<p>there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this</p>
<p>and has designed different nootropics</p>
<p>in order to bring your brain into specific states</p>
<p>for specific types of work.</p>
<p>So for instance, for creative work</p>
<p>or to engage with more focus</p>
<p>or to give you more energy for cognitive or physical work.</p>
<p>So with Thesis, they&rsquo;ll design custom nootropics for you</p>
<p>that will allow you more focus, better task switching,</p>
<p>more creativity, and so on.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be sure to include only the ingredients</p>
<p>that you want and not the ingredients that you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than a year now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer for me.</p>
<p>I like the clarity formula</p>
<p>prior to long bouts of cognitive work</p>
<p>or the energy formula prior to physical workouts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try</p>
<p>your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll take a brief three-minute quiz</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise.</p>
<p>Our mood is off.</p>
<p>Hormone systems go off.</p>
<p>Our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui,</p>
<p>which I can confidently say is the most nutrient dense</p>
<p>and delicious red meat available.</p>
<p>Maui Nui spent nearly a decade</p>
<p>building a USDA certified wild harvesting system</p>
<p>to help balance invasive deer populations</p>
<p>on the Island of Maui.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before on this podcast,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had guests on this podcast</p>
<p>that have emphasized the critical role</p>
<p>of getting quality protein,</p>
<p>not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis,</p>
<p>but also for repair of all tissues,</p>
<p>including brain tissue on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>And the general rule of thumb for that</p>
<p>is one gram of quality protein</p>
<p>per pound of body weight per day.</p>
<p>With Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily,</p>
<p>and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories,</p>
<p>which is also critical for immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>I should say that Maui Nui meats</p>
<p>are not only extremely high quality,</p>
<p>but they are also delicious.</p>
<p>I particularly like their jerky,</p>
<p>so their venison jerky.</p>
<p>I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes,</p>
<p>including ground venison, some venison steaks,</p>
<p>and I love the taste of the venison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lean, but it doesn&rsquo;t taste overly lean or dry at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly delicious.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about headaches.</p>
<p>And as we are soon going to learn,</p>
<p>there are different types of headaches,</p>
<p>and different types of headaches arise from changes</p>
<p>in different types of tissues in the head area</p>
<p>and indeed in the neck area as well.</p>
<p>Now, one of the key things to understand</p>
<p>is that if you want relief from a headache,</p>
<p>you need to understand which tissue is mainly involved</p>
<p>in creating that type of headache.</p>
<p>So for instance, many people suffer</p>
<p>from what are called tension headaches.</p>
<p>Now, tension headaches are a little bit of a misnomer</p>
<p>because many people might think,</p>
<p>oh, tension, I&rsquo;m under a lot of tension and stress,</p>
<p>and therefore I get tension headaches.</p>
<p>And indeed, stress can cause tension headaches.</p>
<p>But tension headaches are really the sort of headache</p>
<p>that you feel around the top part of the head,</p>
<p>not the very top, but sort of where you would put a headband</p>
<p>so above the eyes and around the head.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be experienced</p>
<p>all the way around the head.</p>
<p>But the main underlying reason,</p>
<p>that is the tissue system</p>
<p>that mainly underlies tension headaches</p>
<p>is the muscular system.</p>
<p>There are a lot of muscles on the skull, believe it or not,</p>
<p>of course, on the neck,</p>
<p>and they allow you to move your neck and head.</p>
<p>There are a lot of muscles that lie parallel to the skull,</p>
<p>and oftentimes those muscles</p>
<p>will undergo excessive amounts of constriction.</p>
<p>Now, there are, of course, muscles in the jaw</p>
<p>that can also lead to headache,</p>
<p>and jaw ache, and things of that sort,</p>
<p>and neck aches and headaches.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really pointing out here</p>
<p>is that the muscles are a key player</p>
<p>in the formation of different types of headache,</p>
<p>tension headache in particular.</p>
<p>But of course, muscles and muscle tension</p>
<p>can be involved in the other types of headaches as well.</p>
<p>Okay, so I just want to highlight muscular issues</p>
<p>as one particular source of the ache in headaches.</p>
<p>The other tissue that can be prominently involved</p>
<p>in generating the ache of a headache</p>
<p>are the so-called meninges.</p>
<p>Now, the meninges, in addition to being a fun word to say,</p>
<p>are a bunch of tissues that line the outside of the brain</p>
<p>and reside between the brain and the skull.</p>
<p>So you might think, okay, between the brain and the skull,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably just a little bit of fluid,</p>
<p>and the brain is right up next to the skull,</p>
<p>but it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>The brain is actually encased in a very thick,</p>
<p>very durable sack or casing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wrapped around it tight like saran wrap.</p>
<p>It actually has a name, which is dura, D-U-R-A.</p>
<p>And so you can remember dura, durable.</p>
<p>And having done some surgeries,</p>
<p>many surgeries before on brains of different types,</p>
<p>ranging from human,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m not a neurosurgeon as a clinician,</p>
<p>ranging from human to other types of species,</p>
<p>what you find is that the dura is exceedingly durable.</p>
<p>Getting through this thing</p>
<p>really requires a very sharp razor blade.</p>
<p>So the brain is actually sitting in a very fibrous-like sack</p>
<p>that you simply could not open up with your fingertips</p>
<p>under any conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really durable.</p>
<p>The meninges are in that general area</p>
<p>and also encasing the brain,</p>
<p>and the meninges provide an additional buffer</p>
<p>between the brain and the dura and the skull.</p>
<p>So again, you don&rsquo;t want to think about the brain</p>
<p>as just sitting right next to the skull.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s close by,</p>
<p>but there are a bunch of other thin, fibrous tissues,</p>
<p>many of which are very thin and fragile,</p>
<p>and others of which, such as the dura,</p>
<p>that are very, very strong because they&rsquo;re very fibrous,</p>
<p>almost like a, if you&rsquo;ve ever felt, for instance,</p>
<p>the sail of a sailboat,</p>
<p>you might think, oh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just this big flapping sheet in the wind.</p>
<p>It is anything but a sheet in the wind.</p>
<p>It is a very, very strong and durable material.</p>
<p>Now, the proximity of the dura and the meninges to the brain</p>
<p>and the fact that everything is wrapped</p>
<p>very tightly together,</p>
<p>and the fact that there&rsquo;s a lot of vasculature,</p>
<p>so that would be arteries, blood vessels, and capillaries</p>
<p>are all in that area,</p>
<p>on the top of the brain and throughout the brain.</p>
<p>The fact that all of that is in very close proximity</p>
<p>and wrapped really tight in this very durable sack</p>
<p>is one of the reasons why when blood vessels or arteries,</p>
<p>or both, become dilated, they open,</p>
<p>there creates a pressure between the brain and those tissues.</p>
<p>And because there isn&rsquo;t much distance between the tissues</p>
<p>like the dura and the meninges and the skull,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also pressure that allows for the brain</p>
<p>to literally sneak up, or I should say,</p>
<p>give the impression that your brain</p>
<p>is expanding up against your skull.</p>
<p>So the point here is that while muscular tension</p>
<p>can give rise to headache,</p>
<p>the other thing that can give rise to headache</p>
<p>is so-called vasodilation,</p>
<p>the expansion or the widening of the arteries,</p>
<p>blood vessels, and capillaries.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons why that gives rise to headache</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s simply not a lot of space</p>
<p>for that expansion to go.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow anything except for the brain</p>
<p>to push up against that very durable tissue</p>
<p>and that very durable tissue to push up against the skull.</p>
<p>And even though the brain itself</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have pain receptors, that&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>the brain itself doesn&rsquo;t have pain receptors,</p>
<p>that is why a neurosurgeon can take off a piece of skull</p>
<p>and can probe around in the brain with an electrode</p>
<p>and the person is completely unaware.</p>
<p>And in order to get through the skull,</p>
<p>of course, a little skin flap has to be removed</p>
<p>from the skull.</p>
<p>And that requires a little bit of topical anesthetic,</p>
<p>but really you don&rsquo;t need any anesthetic</p>
<p>to go into the brain itself</p>
<p>because there aren&rsquo;t pain receptors on the brain itself.</p>
<p>However, the tissues surrounding the brain,</p>
<p>such as the dura, the meninges,</p>
<p>and the vasculature that then reaches up,</p>
<p>believe it or not, into the skull,</p>
<p>the vasculature doesn&rsquo;t actually stop</p>
<p>right beneath the skull,</p>
<p>it actually, blood vessels get into the skull</p>
<p>and there are actually portals</p>
<p>by which blood can move within the skull itself.</p>
<p>Well, what that means is that</p>
<p>since all of the tissues are very close by</p>
<p>and very compact with respect to one another,</p>
<p>any increase in the size of the portals</p>
<p>that allow movement of blood there</p>
<p>and the fact that there are what are called nociceptors,</p>
<p>N-O-C-I, nociceptors,</p>
<p>these are essentially pain receptors,</p>
<p>because of the presence of pain receptors</p>
<p>in the tissues around the brain,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s an increase in the size</p>
<p>of those vascular portals,</p>
<p>the arteries, capillaries, and vessels,</p>
<p>we experience that as intense pain and pressure.</p>
<p>And fortunately, there are excellent treatments</p>
<p>for dealing with that intense pain and pressure,</p>
<p>but keep in mind that the intense pain and pressure</p>
<p>that is the consequence of vasodilation,</p>
<p>that is the widening of these different vascular portals,</p>
<p>is very different than the type of pain that arises</p>
<p>from muscular tension,</p>
<p>as is the case with tension headache.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have two sources of pain,</p>
<p>that is the ache and headache,</p>
<p>and there are two more that we need to think about</p>
<p>in trying to better understand</p>
<p>the different types of headaches that we&rsquo;ll discuss</p>
<p>and in terms of trying to understand</p>
<p>which are going to be the best treatments</p>
<p>for the different types of headaches.</p>
<p>And those are neural and inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the neural type first.</p>
<p>There is a type of headache</p>
<p>that many people unfortunately suffer from.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into this in a bunch more detail in a moment.</p>
<p>Those are called cluster headaches.</p>
<p>Cluster headaches are headaches that arise</p>
<p>not from the surface,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t experience them</p>
<p>as kind of a tightening of the forehead</p>
<p>and the neck and the jaw,</p>
<p>but rather it feels as if the headache</p>
<p>is coming from deep within the head,</p>
<p>and in particular from behind the orbit</p>
<p>of one or the other eyes,</p>
<p>and sometimes both eyes.</p>
<p>For those of you that have ever experienced</p>
<p>cluster headaches, they are extremely painful,</p>
<p>even the more, or I should say the relatively</p>
<p>more minor cluster headaches are extremely painful,</p>
<p>and the severe ones are exceedingly painful.</p>
<p>Cluster headaches arise from deep,</p>
<p>or we get the sensation that they are arising</p>
<p>from deep within our head,</p>
<p>as opposed from the surface inward,</p>
<p>because they are neural in origin.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a particular nerve pathway</p>
<p>called the trigeminal nerve</p>
<p>that often is the origin of these cluster headaches</p>
<p>that people experience behind the eye.</p>
<p>The trigeminal, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>has three branches, tri, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a branch that essentially extends to the eye,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a branch that extends to the mandible,</p>
<p>right, to the lip,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a branch that extends</p>
<p>more or less to the nasal area.</p>
<p>And so this trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed,</p>
<p>or in other ways is hyperactivated in some cases,</p>
<p>and that causes the deep pain below the eye</p>
<p>because it is that first branch of the trigeminal nerve,</p>
<p>which is the ophthalmic branch,</p>
<p>which tends to be activated first.</p>
<p>So people start feeling as if there&rsquo;s a pain</p>
<p>behind their eye, in particular on one side.</p>
<p>Oftentimes there&rsquo;s lacrimation, which is tearing up.</p>
<p>There can be some nasal discharge.</p>
<p>Another common symptom of this type of headache,</p>
<p>that is the cluster headache,</p>
<p>is that the pupils sometimes will become very small,</p>
<p>the pupils of the eyes,</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t dilate even in darkness.</p>
<p>So there are a bunch of things that are going on</p>
<p>on one or both sides of the face</p>
<p>that seem to arise from deep within the head,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s almost as if it&rsquo;s coming from the brain outward,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s neural in origin, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got muscular origins of headaches,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got meningeal origins of headaches,</p>
<p>that is the stuff around the brain</p>
<p>and as it relates to the vasculature,</p>
<p>and we have neural origins of headaches.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s inflammation origins of headaches.</p>
<p>Now, inflammation is a term</p>
<p>that gets thrown around a lot these days,</p>
<p>this reduces inflammation and inflammation is bad.</p>
<p>And I suppose in some cases,</p>
<p>and when inflammation is really widespread</p>
<p>across the brain or body, it&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think any of us should think</p>
<p>about inflammation per se as bad.</p>
<p>What I mean is inflammation is just one form of signaling</p>
<p>in the body, which of course includes the brain.</p>
<p>Inflammation of a tissue is one way in which a set of cells,</p>
<p>so these could be, for instance, cells of the immune system,</p>
<p>and we cover this in a detailed episode</p>
<p>all about the immune system.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to check that out,</p>
<p>you go to hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>just put into our search function immune system</p>
<p>and you can find that episode.</p>
<p>By the way, all of our episodes are searchable by keyword</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com and it&rsquo;ll take you to specific episodes</p>
<p>and timestamps for the topics you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>So for sake of this discussion about headache,</p>
<p>inflammation is going to be the case</p>
<p>when one particular tissue in and around the head area</p>
<p>is releasing molecules, cytokines,</p>
<p>which sometimes are called inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>but there are also non-inflammatory</p>
<p>or anti-inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>but inflammatory molecules that are signaling</p>
<p>to the rest of the body,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s something going on here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s either some intrusive object,</p>
<p>and indeed, if you were to get a BB or a splinter</p>
<p>into a particular skin area,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be a lot of inflammation.</p>
<p>So it can be the introduction of a foreign physical object</p>
<p>into an area that will cause inflammation.</p>
<p>It can be the presence of some sort of local toxin</p>
<p>in that area.</p>
<p>It could be a more systemic inflammation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, inflammation in the neck and head area</p>
<p>or frankly, anywhere within the sinus area,</p>
<p>so this would include the mouth, the nose, around the eyes,</p>
<p>because the sinuses,</p>
<p>many of us think of sinuses as just our nose,</p>
<p>but actually, if I were to show you a skull,</p>
<p>a human skull or any other kind of skull,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be very, hopefully, intrigued to learn</p>
<p>that the skull is just not one big piece of solid bone</p>
<p>or a top with a jaw below it.</p>
<p>It actually has all these small,</p>
<p>what are called fenestrations,</p>
<p>little holes and canals that run through the skull</p>
<p>and through the depth of the skull, like little tubes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got them down here on your mandible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got them above your lips.</p>
<p>You have them on either sides of your nose.</p>
<p>Those are the sinuses.</p>
<p>The sinuses allow the passage of different fluids</p>
<p>through the skull because the skull, even though it&rsquo;s bone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a dead tissue, right?</p>
<p>In a live person or animal,</p>
<p>the skull is a very active living tissue.</p>
<p>Indeed, all bone is active living tissue</p>
<p>and it needs to be nourished with blood.</p>
<p>It needs to be nourished with cerebral spinal fluid.</p>
<p>In the case of the skull,</p>
<p>it needs to be nourished with all sorts of important things.</p>
<p>So those sinuses oftentimes can become clogged</p>
<p>as is in the case with sinus headache,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a little bit,</p>
<p>but more generally,</p>
<p>anytime there&rsquo;s inflammation of one given area of the body,</p>
<p>so it could be a shoulder, it could be the neck,</p>
<p>it could be the mouth, it could be the nose,</p>
<p>or in the case of the headache,</p>
<p>it could be any portion of the head or neck.</p>
<p>What happens is inflammation,</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s a very efficient signal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much like the siren on an ambulance or a police car</p>
<p>in that it sends out a very broad signal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very clear something is wrong here</p>
<p>and needs to be dealt with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very specific.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very robust, but it&rsquo;s not very specific.</p>
<p>So for instance, if there&rsquo;s a little bacterial infection</p>
<p>or a little viral infection,</p>
<p>the inflammation response to that site of infection</p>
<p>tends to be far more widespread</p>
<p>than the actual site of infection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit different</p>
<p>when you have a foreign object there,</p>
<p>like a splinter or some other foreign object,</p>
<p>that tends to be a bit more localized.</p>
<p>And the immune system is always trying to limit</p>
<p>the extent of inflammation</p>
<p>by putting in different scar tissues.</p>
<p>Indeed, a lot of the things that we think of</p>
<p>as kind of gross, pussy,</p>
<p>pustules and boils and things like that,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a gross topic,</p>
<p>are ways in which our body tries to restrict</p>
<p>the amount of inflammation.</p>
<p>But the face area and the head itself</p>
<p>are so heavily infused with blood vessels,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a constant perfusion, as we say,</p>
<p>of blood and cerebral spinal fluid and other things</p>
<p>through this incredibly metabolically active tissue</p>
<p>that we call our brain and our eyes.</p>
<p>Those are by far the most metabolically active tissues</p>
<p>in our entire body.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re running hundreds of miles in ultramarathons,</p>
<p>your brain is still far more metabolically demanding</p>
<p>than all the muscles of your body combined,</p>
<p>no matter what the conditions.</p>
<p>Because of that, there tends to be a generalization</p>
<p>or a spreading out of any inflammatory response.</p>
<p>And that inflammatory response</p>
<p>then can trigger the pain mechanisms</p>
<p>or what we experience as pain mechanisms</p>
<p>in the other three types of tissues that we talked about.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you have a systemic infection</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re experiencing inflammation of any kind,</p>
<p>and it has anything to do with</p>
<p>or encroaches on the face or head area,</p>
<p>that can easily and almost always spills over</p>
<p>into activation of nerve cells,</p>
<p>can give rise to neural-based headache,</p>
<p>or to the meninges and can give rise to meningeal headaches,</p>
<p>and of course, to the muscles and to muscular-type headaches.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got muscular origins of the ache in headache,</p>
<p>we have meningeal origins of the ache in headache,</p>
<p>we have neural origins of the ache in headache,</p>
<p>and we have inflammation-based origins</p>
<p>of the ache in headache.</p>
<p>And that pertains to all the different types of headaches</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind</p>
<p>that there are these different sources</p>
<p>of the ache in headache,</p>
<p>and that sometimes they exist alone,</p>
<p>and sometimes they exist in combination.</p>
<p>However, and this is an important however,</p>
<p>all pain, or I should say,</p>
<p>all experience of pain as a perception</p>
<p>is going to be neural in origin.</p>
<p>When we experience pain,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a pinprick or a cut,</p>
<p>stub our toe, we trip and fall, or a headache,</p>
<p>it is neural in origin.</p>
<p>It is the nervous system and nerve cells</p>
<p>that are going to carry that signal</p>
<p>that we perceive as pain.</p>
<p>So as we talk about the different sources of pain</p>
<p>and different types of headache,</p>
<p>we will also talk about, of course,</p>
<p>I think what most people are interested in</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>the different treatments for the different types of headache</p>
<p>and why each of those different treatments work.</p>
<p>But by understanding a little bit</p>
<p>about how pain arises in the nervous system,</p>
<p>and certainly by understanding</p>
<p>the different types of headaches,</p>
<p>you know, what is a tension headache?</p>
<p>I gave you some impression that it&rsquo;s running around</p>
<p>your head like a headband in many cases,</p>
<p>versus cluster headache,</p>
<p>which starts deep below the eye often,</p>
<p>it feels as if it&rsquo;s emerging from deep in the brain,</p>
<p>versus migraine, which we&rsquo;ll get into in a moment.</p>
<p>By understanding the different types of headaches,</p>
<p>you should be able to quickly pinpoint</p>
<p>what type of headache you have,</p>
<p>what types of tissues are likely involved,</p>
<p>and therefore what types of treatments</p>
<p>are going to most quickly</p>
<p>and most completely relieve that type of headache.</p>
<p>Okay, so for the next three to five minutes,</p>
<p>and I promise no more,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain how pain arises</p>
<p>at the level of nerve cells.</p>
<p>And I suppose this is one of those times</p>
<p>when if I had a highlighter pen that could go out</p>
<p>across the microphones and speakers,</p>
<p>leading to your ears, I would use it here.</p>
<p>Because what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>is perhaps one of the most important things</p>
<p>to understand about your nervous system,</p>
<p>that is your brain and you,</p>
<p>which is that while you have trillions of neurons,</p>
<p>and we hear that, you have trillions</p>
<p>and different types of neurons in your brain,</p>
<p>and they come in different shapes and sizes</p>
<p>and do different things,</p>
<p>and some make dopamine and some make serotonin,</p>
<p>and some make glutamate and on and on.</p>
<p>The key distinction among different types of neurons,</p>
<p>that is the three types of neurons</p>
<p>that I believe everybody, scientists or no,</p>
<p>everybody should understand exist,</p>
<p>are some neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>are what we call motor neurons,</p>
<p>in the sense that they control the contraction of muscles.</p>
<p>Sometimes for walking,</p>
<p>other neurons control the movements of your fingers,</p>
<p>scientists call those digits,</p>
<p>other ones, your toes.</p>
<p>They also control the beating of your heart,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a slightly different mechanism</p>
<p>and slightly different type of tissue</p>
<p>than is involved in generating motor movements</p>
<p>of your limbs.</p>
<p>These are neurons that we call motor neurons</p>
<p>because their goal or their purpose, I should say,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really know what their goal or purpose is,</p>
<p>but what they do is they make sure that muscles contract</p>
<p>so that certain things happen in your body,</p>
<p>like your heart beats or you move your limbs,</p>
<p>you lift your eyelids or your eyebrows rather,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Other types of neurons are what we call sensory neurons.</p>
<p>They communicate the same way that motor neurons do,</p>
<p>that is they fire what we call action potentials,</p>
<p>which are just electrical signals,</p>
<p>they release neurotransmitters like any other neuron,</p>
<p>but they respond to certain events in the environment</p>
<p>or the environment within the body,</p>
<p>but they are not responsible</p>
<p>for generating muscular contractions.</p>
<p>So we call these sensory neurons.</p>
<p>Some sensory neurons sense light touch.</p>
<p>Other sensory neurons sense firm touch.</p>
<p>Other sensory neurons sense pain.</p>
<p>Other sensory neurons sense light brushing on the skin.</p>
<p>In fact, you have sensory neurons, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that respond specifically to the light brushing of a hand</p>
<p>across your skin, any region of your body,</p>
<p>and if that particular region of your body</p>
<p>happens to have hair on it and you stroke the skin</p>
<p>in the direction that the hairs lay down,</p>
<p>we experience that as pleasurable,</p>
<p>whereas if you stroke in the direction opposite</p>
<p>to the way the hairs lay down,</p>
<p>we experience that as not pleasurable.</p>
<p>So these sensory neurons respond in some cases,</p>
<p>for instance, within the auditory system,</p>
<p>they respond to sound waves in your eye,</p>
<p>they respond to photons of light,</p>
<p>sometimes photons of light of particular wavelengths</p>
<p>that we think of as red, green, blue, and so on.</p>
<p>Sensory neurons don&rsquo;t move muscles,</p>
<p>they respond to things in the environment</p>
<p>and they exist within us.</p>
<p>So we have sensory neurons that sense, for instance,</p>
<p>pressure within our head or pressure within our gut,</p>
<p>how full or empty our gut is, pain within our tissues,</p>
<p>like our liver or any kind of other internal organ.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got motor neurons, sensory neurons,</p>
<p>and then the last kind of neuron</p>
<p>is what we call modulatory neurons.</p>
<p>These are the ones that adjust the relationship</p>
<p>between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons</p>
<p>to determine whether or not we do anything</p>
<p>in response to a sensory input.</p>
<p>That is whether or not if a sensory neuron fires,</p>
<p>sends an electrical potential,</p>
<p>whether or not it will generate a motor change.</p>
<p>Let me give you a very simple example of this.</p>
<p>So for those of you listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just explain what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And for those of you watching,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to see I&rsquo;m holding my hand out</p>
<p>in front of me.</p>
<p>If I were to touch the top of my hand with my fingertip,</p>
<p>I can deliberately override,</p>
<p>that is I can modulate that more typical reflex,</p>
<p>which is that when something touches us,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not aware of where it&rsquo;s coming from,</p>
<p>we typically move away from that thing that touches.</p>
<p>This is a very natural response,</p>
<p>but we can decide we&rsquo;re not going to move away.</p>
<p>We can decide to stay still,</p>
<p>or we can decide to move toward the thing that touches us.</p>
<p>But typically, if you were to walk up to somebody</p>
<p>and you were to touch them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d either turn toward you</p>
<p>on the side that you touch them, or they&rsquo;d step away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that they&rsquo;re going to step into you,</p>
<p>but you could decide that you were not going to move away</p>
<p>or you could step into the direction of touch.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you have modulatory neurons</p>
<p>that can adjust the conversation</p>
<p>in a very context-dependent way</p>
<p>as to whether or not the sensory neuron</p>
<p>will cause motor neurons to contract or not, okay?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got motor neurons, sensory neurons,</p>
<p>and modulatory neurons.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re probably thinking by now,</p>
<p>why are we talking about this?</p>
<p>I thought we&rsquo;re going to talk about headache.</p>
<p>I thought we&rsquo;re going to talk about treatments for headache,</p>
<p>but this turns out to be very important</p>
<p>because you could imagine,</p>
<p>and in a moment I&rsquo;ll explain how,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have tension headaches.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somebody that has the classic symptoms</p>
<p>of tension headache.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what those are.</p>
<p>These are headaches, again,</p>
<p>that occur more or less in a kind of a headband-like fashion</p>
<p>or they tend to start there and exist around the head.</p>
<p>These are very common.</p>
<p>They can arise from a number of different sources,</p>
<p>arise from sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>They can arise from excessive use of caffeine intake.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about why that is.</p>
<p>They can arise from stress.</p>
<p>They can arise from very low-level viral infections</p>
<p>or bacterial infections.</p>
<p>But we experience these as just as headaches</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve been thinking too hard or working too hard</p>
<p>or life has been stressful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often also associated with jaw pain</p>
<p>and jaw tightness and neck tightness.</p>
<p>So tension headaches, everything you&rsquo;d imagine</p>
<p>muscular tension could cause.</p>
<p>Well, if you want to treat tension headache,</p>
<p>you can imagine that because all headache is neural,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d want to go after some sort of neural mechanism</p>
<p>to treat them.</p>
<p>But of course, we now know</p>
<p>that there are three types of neurons.</p>
<p>There are motor neurons, sensory neurons,</p>
<p>and modulatory neurons.</p>
<p>So we have choices.</p>
<p>We can say, okay, do we want to turn off the muscles</p>
<p>in the head, jaw, and neck that are hyper-contracted?</p>
<p>For instance, you want to take a muscle relaxer</p>
<p>or relaxtant, or would you want to try</p>
<p>and change the sensory input itself?</p>
<p>Maybe don&rsquo;t change the way the muscles are behaving,</p>
<p>but shut off the sensory part of it,</p>
<p>your ability to sense it.</p>
<p>There are certainly ways you can do that.</p>
<p>Or would you want to adjust the modulatory neurons?</p>
<p>Would you want to make it such that you have the headache,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t perceive the headache?</p>
<p>That is, you cut off communication between the sensor</p>
<p>and the motor so that the muscles relax.</p>
<p>Turns out there are treatments and approaches</p>
<p>for each and every one of those.</p>
<p>Each and every one of those has different advantages</p>
<p>and disadvantages.</p>
<p>But as you can quickly see,</p>
<p>we are going to have different types of headaches</p>
<p>and different approaches to treating headache.</p>
<p>But if you keep in the back of your mind</p>
<p>that you have neurons that contract muscles</p>
<p>to create movement or tension of muscles,</p>
<p>remember, you can turn off those neurons</p>
<p>and allow those muscles to relax.</p>
<p>You have sensory neurons that sense input</p>
<p>and actually sense the pain.</p>
<p>And you have modulatory neurons,</p>
<p>which can allow you to adjust the relationship</p>
<p>between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons.</p>
<p>And of course, some of you are probably screaming at me</p>
<p>by now saying, wait, why would you ever want to deal</p>
<p>with the motor neurons or the modulatory neurons?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to just go straight to the source</p>
<p>and just cut off the pain?</p>
<p>Ah, well, the problem there is that many painkillers</p>
<p>have other issues as well.</p>
<p>In particular, they can be sedative.</p>
<p>Many of them can be habit-forming or even addictive.</p>
<p>And for many people, not all, but many people,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to take drugs,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re over-the-counter or prescription drugs</p>
<p>or even more natural supplement-based type treatments.</p>
<p>And they would rather use, for instance,</p>
<p>a behavioral approach in which they can modulate,</p>
<p>they can deliberately turn off the communication</p>
<p>between sensory neurons and motor neurons.</p>
<p>And it turns out those approaches exist as well.</p>
<p>Okay, so at this point, I promise you</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not going to give you any more of a biology lesson</p>
<p>in terms of pain sensing and headaches</p>
<p>as a more conceptual phenomenon.</p>
<p>Instead, what I&rsquo;d like to do next</p>
<p>is talk about the different types of headaches.</p>
<p>And I think this is something that&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>and not often discussed, except for those people out there</p>
<p>that unfortunately suffer repeatedly</p>
<p>from certain kinds of headaches,</p>
<p>like migraine or cluster or tension headache.</p>
<p>But I think for most people out there</p>
<p>who experience headache, and again, that is everybody</p>
<p>at some point experiences headache,</p>
<p>rather than just think of headache as one thing,</p>
<p>understanding the major types of headache</p>
<p>and how they differ from and are similar to one another</p>
<p>will really help you identify</p>
<p>what the best source of treatments for those are.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk about</p>
<p>what the different types of headache are now.</p>
<p>The first type of headache we&rsquo;re going to discuss</p>
<p>is the tension-type headache.</p>
<p>Again, tension-type headaches tend to start off,</p>
<p>not always, but tend to start off</p>
<p>as more or less a halo or a headband</p>
<p>around the forehead in the area above the eyes,</p>
<p>often also include the jaw, the neck muscles,</p>
<p>and can extend even into the upper back.</p>
<p>Again, this can be caused by some low level of infection,</p>
<p>but more often than not,</p>
<p>tension-type headaches are going to come on</p>
<p>because of some chronic psychological stress,</p>
<p>usually combined with lack of sleep,</p>
<p>usually combined with lifestyle issues.</p>
<p>And of course, without getting into a long discussion</p>
<p>about it, anytime you have lack of sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have excessive stress.</p>
<p>Anytime you have excessive stress,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to make sure you&rsquo;re offsetting that</p>
<p>by getting proper sleep.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t when they&rsquo;re under excessive stress.</p>
<p>By the way, we have excellent tools</p>
<p>or grounded in excellent science</p>
<p>available to you at zero cost.</p>
<p>If you are experienced chronic stress</p>
<p>or even short-term stress,</p>
<p>we have a master stress episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Again, just go to hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>and all that&rsquo;s timestamped for you.</p>
<p>Tension-type headaches begin in a,</p>
<p>more or less a headband pattern,</p>
<p>but can really extend to other tissues as well.</p>
<p>Not so often in the face,</p>
<p>but really the head and often will start to climb up</p>
<p>toward the top of the head.</p>
<p>They are not always in this halo pattern.</p>
<p>Sometimes they can be localized to one area,</p>
<p>such as the back of the head or the front of the head</p>
<p>or one side of the head more than others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s often the case</p>
<p>because of tension within muscles of the neck</p>
<p>that tend to bias the ache towards one side of the head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>that are going to strongly impact</p>
<p>our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>The other type of headache</p>
<p>that unfortunately is very common is migraine headaches.</p>
<p>Migraine headaches are defined generally</p>
<p>as disorders of recurring attacks of headaches.</p>
<p>So people who get migraines</p>
<p>often get them in a recurring fashion.</p>
<p>Some people get them very often,</p>
<p>other people get them less often,</p>
<p>but migraines are very debilitating.</p>
<p>The numbers, that is the prevalence of migraine</p>
<p>is still pretty debated.</p>
<p>One thing that we know for sure</p>
<p>is that females suffer from migraine headaches</p>
<p>at a rate at least threefold higher than do males.</p>
<p>And surprisingly, this does not seem</p>
<p>to have any direct hormonal origin,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re also going to talk about hormonal headaches,</p>
<p>that is headaches that relate to a dip in estrogen</p>
<p>and progesterone in a particular phase</p>
<p>of the menstrual cycle, that is the ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bit of a mystery here,</p>
<p>and the mystery is why is it that migraine headaches</p>
<p>occur at such greater frequency in females,</p>
<p>even independently of the menstrual cycle?</p>
<p>So when you control for changes in hormones,</p>
<p>that still appears to be the case.</p>
<p>And overall, migraines are very common.</p>
<p>Now, the numbers on migraine</p>
<p>and just how common migraine is are extremely wide.</p>
<p>This was a little bit frustrating for me</p>
<p>in researching this episode.</p>
<p>You will find, for instance,</p>
<p>that 17% of women suffer from migraines.</p>
<p>You will also hear that 6% of males suffer from migraines.</p>
<p>You will also hear that 43, 43% of females</p>
<p>suffer from migraine, that is recurring headaches</p>
<p>that qualifies migraine headaches.</p>
<p>And that 17% of men suffer from migraine headaches</p>
<p>on a recurring basis, which is, again,</p>
<p>the definition of a migraine headache,</p>
<p>or one of the key definitions.</p>
<p>So all we can say for sure is that many, many millions</p>
<p>of people, maybe even billions of people</p>
<p>suffer from migraine headaches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a staggering thing to contemplate,</p>
<p>but we know it&rsquo;s extremely common,</p>
<p>and we know that it&rsquo;s more prevalent in females.</p>
<p>In any of the studies that you will find</p>
<p>in terms of that compare the overall prevalence of headache,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be higher,</p>
<p>substantially higher in females than males,</p>
<p>does not seem to be related</p>
<p>to the ovulatory menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>There are some interesting facts related to that</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll just touch on for a moment.</p>
<p>Pregnancy, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>seems to be protective against migraine headaches.</p>
<p>That is, women who suffer from recurring migraines</p>
<p>before they get pregnant, when they get pregnant,</p>
<p>and often after they give birth,</p>
<p>they experience fewer migraine headaches.</p>
<p>So there may be something hormonal,</p>
<p>it may be something else.</p>
<p>What do we know for sure?</p>
<p>We know that headache,</p>
<p>that is the ache in headache, is neural.</p>
<p>So whether or not the origins are hormonal</p>
<p>or whether or not the origins are inflammation</p>
<p>or gut microbiome or some other feature</p>
<p>of the body-brain axis,</p>
<p>at this point, all we know is that neural pain</p>
<p>or the experience of pain at the neural level</p>
<p>is the final common pathway,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more prevalent in females.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned, migraines tend to be recurring.</p>
<p>So some people get them once a week,</p>
<p>some people get them once a month,</p>
<p>some people get them far more frequently</p>
<p>that they can be extremely debilitating.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people who experience migraine</p>
<p>because it is a recurring phenomenon</p>
<p>will know when a migraine is coming on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, my migraine is coming on.</p>
<p>They kind of sense it coming.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this notion of aura,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about aura in a little bit.</p>
<p>Some people think of aura just as visual aura</p>
<p>or the sense of kind of a haloing of light</p>
<p>or the sense that there&rsquo;s something outside the body.</p>
<p>The actual definition of aura is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the experience that something is about to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this kind of feeling of anticipation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not deja vu.</p>
<p>Deja vu is different and very interesting in its own right,</p>
<p>but different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this feeling that something&rsquo;s about to happen.</p>
<p>And the fact that aura is such a prominent feature</p>
<p>of migraine headaches,</p>
<p>or at least that people feel that the headache is coming on</p>
<p>long before they feel the actual ache of the headache</p>
<p>and the other debilitating symptoms,</p>
<p>suggests that migraine has something of deep neural origin,</p>
<p>that it arises from deep within the nervous system,</p>
<p>spinal cord and brain,</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s not something like a tension headache</p>
<p>that is going from outside in,</p>
<p>the constriction of the muscles in the jaw and head.</p>
<p>So migraine headaches are very different</p>
<p>than tension headaches,</p>
<p>even in terms of how they come on or their onset.</p>
<p>The other feature of migraine headaches</p>
<p>that I think is important to note</p>
<p>is that dilation of the vessels.</p>
<p>Remember the vasodilation,</p>
<p>so the widening of those pipes that we call arteries,</p>
<p>vessels and capillaries</p>
<p>is a very prominent feature of migraine.</p>
<p>And fortunately that allows</p>
<p>for very particular types of treatment</p>
<p>and ways of dealing with this pain</p>
<p>specific to migraine headaches.</p>
<p>The other feature that&rsquo;s common in migraine headaches</p>
<p>is so-called photophobia.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar with photophobia.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been sleep deprived,</p>
<p>simply if you&rsquo;re sleep deprived</p>
<p>and you go outside in the morning,</p>
<p>the light is going to seem very, very bright,</p>
<p>much brighter than were you to have had</p>
<p>a really good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because during sleep,</p>
<p>there are all sorts of reset mechanisms in the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the washing out of metabolic debris</p>
<p>and things in the brain,</p>
<p>the so-called glymphotic washout that&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an adjustment of the neural tissue of the eyes,</p>
<p>which as many of you have heard me say before,</p>
<p>are actually two pieces of brain</p>
<p>that have been extruded from the cranial vault.</p>
<p>So your eyes, yes, indeed are two pieces of brain,</p>
<p>the only two pieces of brain outside the cranial vault.</p>
<p>And within your eyes,</p>
<p>you have neurons and mechanisms</p>
<p>that adjust the sort of sensitivity of your eyes to light</p>
<p>and of your brain to light.</p>
<p>And when you are sleep deprived</p>
<p>or when you have a low level viral infection</p>
<p>or a cold or a flu of any kind,</p>
<p>you tend to experience light as brighter</p>
<p>than it actually is when you&rsquo;re rested</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in the healthy state.</p>
<p>So photophobia is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very, very common in migraine.</p>
<p>And often the photophobia is a prominent feature</p>
<p>of the experience that a migraine is coming on.</p>
<p>People will start saying,</p>
<p>oh, you know, it&rsquo;s just too bright in here.</p>
<p>And normally they&rsquo;d be able to tolerate</p>
<p>that level of sunlight or indoor lighting with no problem.</p>
<p>So there are two aspects of migraine</p>
<p>that I think are particularly important to understand</p>
<p>for sake of the treatment,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the dilation of vessels.</p>
<p>So if we want to treat migraine,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have to think about things</p>
<p>that can constrict blood vessels in the brain area.</p>
<p>But we also need to think about photophobia,</p>
<p>not photophobia just as a symptom of migraine,</p>
<p>but that maybe by adjusting our sensitivity to light,</p>
<p>we can actually short circuit some of the onset</p>
<p>and subsequent pathology of the migraine.</p>
<p>That is, if we can prevent photophobia,</p>
<p>partially or completely,</p>
<p>can actually offset a lot of the ache of the migraine</p>
<p>that would otherwise occur.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an exciting avenue</p>
<p>for addressing migraine headaches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into photophobia and how to deal with that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also talk about aura a little bit more</p>
<p>in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But for the time being,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about tension headaches.</p>
<p>We now talked about migraine headaches.</p>
<p>Again, keep in mind,</p>
<p>knowing what kind of headache you have is essential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I would say,</p>
<p>indispensable for selecting the best treatment.</p>
<p>Many people out there will simply get a headache</p>
<p>and decide, oh, I&rsquo;m going to pop a couple of aspirin.</p>
<p>Okay, what does aspirin do?</p>
<p>Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>It also has pronounced effects</p>
<p>on the vasodilation and vasoconstriction system.</p>
<p>It actually allows more blood to flow</p>
<p>through those arteries, vessels, and capillaries.</p>
<p>A lot of people actually use baby aspirin</p>
<p>or small amounts of aspirin</p>
<p>as a way to offset cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another discussion, but what do we know?</p>
<p>We know that in migraine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hyperdilation of the blood vessels,</p>
<p>a hyperdilation of the very little portals</p>
<p>that exist in the brain and around the brain</p>
<p>and that are going to cause the pain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to activate those sensory neurons,</p>
<p>those nociceptors,</p>
<p>that will then give us the experience</p>
<p>of extreme headache and migraine.</p>
<p>So taking an aspirin or something like it for migraine,</p>
<p>in some cases, the worst possible choice.</p>
<p>Again, so knowing what kind of headache</p>
<p>you are experiencing is going to be essential here.</p>
<p>The other thing that you&rsquo;ll sometimes hear</p>
<p>is that drinking a cup of coffee</p>
<p>or getting caffeine through tea</p>
<p>is a great way to deal with headache.</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that coffee</p>
<p>can cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation,</p>
<p>depending on when you take it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get into the use of caffeine</p>
<p>as a treatment for headache,</p>
<p>because indeed it can be a very potent treatment</p>
<p>for headache, but you absolutely need to know</p>
<p>what kind of headache you are experiencing,</p>
<p>because in some cases, drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in tea or coffee,</p>
<p>can absolutely alleviate the pain of a headache,</p>
<p>especially if you catch that onset of a migraine</p>
<p>or attention type headache early on.</p>
<p>But in some cases, it can make it far, far worse.</p>
<p>Again, knowing which type of headache you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>and how the different treatments work is key.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have attention type headaches,</p>
<p>migraine type headaches.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re starting to get the picture.</p>
<p>They have different underlying biologies.</p>
<p>The next type of headache is cluster headaches.</p>
<p>Cluster headaches are the ones I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>that arise from deep within the head.</p>
<p>They feel as if they&rsquo;re coming from the inside out,</p>
<p>and they tend to be on one side or the other,</p>
<p>what scientists and clinicians call unilateral.</p>
<p>It tends to originate behind the eye</p>
<p>and sometimes the nose region,</p>
<p>sometimes in the mouth region as well.</p>
<p>It feels kind of patchy,</p>
<p>but as if it&rsquo;s coming from the inside out.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s because of that trigeminal nerve.</p>
<p>For those of you listening and not watching this on YouTube,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got three fingers as if I&rsquo;m putting up three fingers</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got one pointed toward my eye,</p>
<p>one pointed towards my nose region,</p>
<p>and one towards my upper lip.</p>
<p>The trigeminal nerve is an easy one to remember,</p>
<p>and it will completely explain cluster headaches</p>
<p>and what to do about cluster headaches in a moment</p>
<p>if you remember that the herpes one virus,</p>
<p>and not herpes two, not genital herpes,</p>
<p>but herpes one virus is the one</p>
<p>that gives cold sores on the mouth.</p>
<p>Herpes one virus, by the way, is exceedingly common,</p>
<p>up to 90% of people, many children in fact have these.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a sexually transmitted herpes,</p>
<p>although it can be, of course,</p>
<p>transmitted through kissing and sexual contact,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the only origin of it.</p>
<p>Okay, it can be passed by skin contact and mucosal contact.</p>
<p>So mucosal, mucosal, so that would be kissing,</p>
<p>mucosal lining, or even skin to mucosal lining.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so common.</p>
<p>And the reason why cold sores develop on the mouth</p>
<p>for people that have herpes one</p>
<p>is because the virus actually lives on the trigeminal nerve.</p>
<p>And yes, it is true that sometimes the virus</p>
<p>will inflame the nerve and the inflammation will occur</p>
<p>at the level of the eye.</p>
<p>So people do unfortunately sometimes get herpes of the eye.</p>
<p>It actually can be quite dangerous</p>
<p>if you have an infection of the eye,</p>
<p>herpes infection of the eye,</p>
<p>you should see an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Or the nose region, they can experience pain</p>
<p>in the mucosal tissue of the nose.</p>
<p>More often than not, the most inflammation</p>
<p>is occurring on the branch that innervates the lip</p>
<p>or the region close to the lip.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why a cold sore develops there,</p>
<p>an immune response there,</p>
<p>signaling that there&rsquo;s inflammation</p>
<p>due to the herpes virus,</p>
<p>which lives on that neuron for a very long time.</p>
<p>Neurons don&rsquo;t turn over in the lifespan,</p>
<p>so it can live on there for the extent of the person&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>However, most people hopefully treat their HSV-1,</p>
<p>but if they don&rsquo;t, the sort of frequency</p>
<p>and the severity of infections</p>
<p>tends to taper off with time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have an entire discussion about viruses</p>
<p>and herpes in particular in a future episode.</p>
<p>But the thing to keep in mind here</p>
<p>is that this very nerve is the one that gets inflamed</p>
<p>in these cluster-type headaches.</p>
<p>Now, cluster-type headaches are associated</p>
<p>with a bunch of very uncomfortable symptoms.</p>
<p>Again, they tend to be unilateral,</p>
<p>they tend to begin very deep,</p>
<p>and they tend to be excruciatingly painful,</p>
<p>excruciatingly painful.</p>
<p>They can last anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours.</p>
<p>Some people experience these in sleep.</p>
<p>In fact, this is one of the cases</p>
<p>where men experience a headache more than females.</p>
<p>Men experience cluster-type headaches</p>
<p>that have a sudden onset during sleep</p>
<p>at five times the frequency than do females.</p>
<p>The origins of that aren&rsquo;t exactly clear.</p>
<p>They do seem to have something to do</p>
<p>with the biological clock mechanisms,</p>
<p>the so-called circadian mechanisms.</p>
<p>So if you are a man or a woman for that matter,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>with a unilateral headache,</p>
<p>and it seems like it&rsquo;s deep within your head,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s starting there, and it&rsquo;s on one side,</p>
<p>and localized to the eye,</p>
<p>and maybe these other regions</p>
<p>the trigeminal is involved in,</p>
<p>you may be suffering from cluster-type headache,</p>
<p>and you should talk to your physician.</p>
<p>The other symptom that&rsquo;s quite common</p>
<p>in cluster-type headache is a droopy eyelid,</p>
<p>which should make sense</p>
<p>because the trigeminal innervates the eye region,</p>
<p>and there are other nerves that control the eyelid,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re in that general region,</p>
<p>and they can be impacted.</p>
<p>The other thing is something called meiosis,</p>
<p>which is that you can&rsquo;t dilate the pupil.</p>
<p>I mentioned this before,</p>
<p>so your pupils might get really, really small,</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t dilate.</p>
<p>And the other thing is lacrimation, tearing,</p>
<p>and then nasal discharge,</p>
<p>all because of a neural inflammation problem.</p>
<p>Why do I tell you with such detail about cluster headaches?</p>
<p>Well, if you are somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s experiencing the kind of pain</p>
<p>that is consistent with cluster headache,</p>
<p>taking a standard anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>or doing something that is going to adjust the dilation</p>
<p>or constriction of blood vessels</p>
<p>may have an indirect impact on cluster headache,</p>
<p>but is unlikely to relieve cluster headache,</p>
<p>either acutely, meaning right away,</p>
<p>or in preventing cluster headaches.</p>
<p>You have to deal with this as a neural issue,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about some of the main causes of inflammation</p>
<p>and activation of these cluster-type headaches</p>
<p>at the level of the trigeminal nerve in a little bit,</p>
<p>because fortunately, there are some excellent treatments.</p>
<p>The next type of headache that is quite common</p>
<p>are hormonal headaches.</p>
<p>Now, the phrase hormonal headache</p>
<p>should already cue you to the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s far too general a term</p>
<p>because there are so many different hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone, estrogen, thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>growth hormone, and on and on and on,</p>
<p>and they all have many different functions</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>Every single hormone,</p>
<p>and in particular, the so-called steroid hormones,</p>
<p>steroids, again, not just limited</p>
<p>to things that people take for sports.</p>
<p>In fact, the steroid hormones refers to estrogen,</p>
<p>testosterone of the sort that we all make,</p>
<p>that men and women make naturally,</p>
<p>and those steroid hormones can impact gene expression.</p>
<p>Of course, what turns on the growth of the breast tissue,</p>
<p>of the testicular tissue, of hair growth, and on and on,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all because of gene expression.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really going to change the identity</p>
<p>and function of a cell long-term, right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to literally change the breast tissue</p>
<p>or change the penile tissue or change the ovarian tissue</p>
<p>in some sort of consistent way across the lifespan,</p>
<p>you can bet that there are changes in gene expression,</p>
<p>and those changes in gene expression occur</p>
<p>because these steroid hormones have this incredible ability,</p>
<p>sort of like the X-Men of hormones,</p>
<p>to pass through the outer membrane of a cell,</p>
<p>which we call the extracellular membrane,</p>
<p>and into the so-called nuclear membrane.</p>
<p>They can go into the area where genes are made</p>
<p>and turn on and off different genes.</p>
<p>However, they multitask in their life.</p>
<p>That is, these steroid hormones,</p>
<p>like estrogen in particular and testosterone in particular,</p>
<p>can also bind to the surface of cells</p>
<p>and impact all sorts of things at the level of the cells</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with changes in gene expression.</p>
<p>And that second mechanism of binding</p>
<p>to the surface of cells is one of the ways</p>
<p>in which estrogen can control different aspects of headache.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that estrogen gives you headaches.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s just the opposite.</p>
<p>It turns out that low estrogen</p>
<p>and another hormone, low progesterone,</p>
<p>combine to give rise to headache</p>
<p>because of the ways that low estrogen and low progesterone</p>
<p>impact vasodilation and vasoconstriction</p>
<p>and the inflammatory response.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about how to deal with hormone-based headaches,</p>
<p>in particular hormone-based headaches</p>
<p>that occur because of low estrogen</p>
<p>and progesterone in a moment.</p>
<p>But the key thing to know is something</p>
<p>that we covered in the fertility episode.</p>
<p>I did a very long, very detailed episode on fertility,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not going to go into this in significant detail now.</p>
<p>You can refer to that episode</p>
<p>for probably more detail than you ever wanted,</p>
<p>but also a lot of tools as it relates to fertility</p>
<p>in both males and females.</p>
<p>But right now, I&rsquo;m just going to give you</p>
<p>a course overview of that in about 60 to 120 seconds</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;ll understand when hormonal headaches</p>
<p>are most likely to take place.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that hormonal headaches</p>
<p>are most likely to take place</p>
<p>when estrogen and progesterone are lowest.</p>
<p>So if you understand that during the follicular stage</p>
<p>of the ovulatory slash menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>okay, so menstrual cycle is about 28 days on average,</p>
<p>not in everyone, but it&rsquo;s about 28 days on average,</p>
<p>and the first half of that,</p>
<p>estrogen starts creeping up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,</p>
<p>and as we learn in endocrinology,</p>
<p>estrogen primes progesterone.</p>
<p>So estrogen will then peak and then start to fall,</p>
<p>low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, pretty quickly,</p>
<p>right about the time that the egg ovulates.</p>
<p>An egg is released</p>
<p>and will essentially be ready for fertilization.</p>
<p>If the egg is fertilized,</p>
<p>a whole bunch of other things happen</p>
<p>as it relates to pregnancy.</p>
<p>If not, what ends up happening is that</p>
<p>during the luteal phase,</p>
<p>which is the second half of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a buildup of the lining of the uterus</p>
<p>because of an increase in progesterone.</p>
<p>So estrogen goes up during the follicular phase,</p>
<p>then it goes down,</p>
<p>and then progesterone goes up, up, up, up, up,</p>
<p>which is important for generating</p>
<p>that thick lining of the uterus</p>
<p>to allow the fertilized egg,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s fertilized to implant,</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s not fertilized,</p>
<p>all of that gets released from the body</p>
<p>in this bleeding process that we call menstruation.</p>
<p>If menstruation occurs and day one of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>is considered the first day in which bleeding occurs,</p>
<p>well, then what that means is that estrogen is already low</p>
<p>because remember, estrogen was low</p>
<p>at the start of the follicular phase</p>
<p>and went up, up, up, up, up,</p>
<p>then it comes down right at the time of ovulation</p>
<p>and progesterone goes up, up, up, up, up</p>
<p>during the luteal phase.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s more than a thousand fold increase</p>
<p>in progesterone,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s no fertilization of the egg,</p>
<p>progesterone starts coming down, down, down, down, down.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>That means that on the first</p>
<p>to about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>first being the first day of bleeding</p>
<p>to about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>both estrogen and progesterone are very, very low.</p>
<p>And it is at that time,</p>
<p>at the very beginning of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>so about the first week of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>that many women are very prone to hormonal headaches.</p>
<p>Hormonal headaches, not because estrogen&rsquo;s high,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a common misconception,</p>
<p>rather because estrogen and progesterone are both low.</p>
<p>And now that you understand the contour</p>
<p>or the underlying reasons for hormonal headache,</p>
<p>you can start to ask,</p>
<p>well, what happens when estrogen is low?</p>
<p>Well, estrogen has strong impact</p>
<p>on the vasodilation vasoconstriction system,</p>
<p>as does progesterone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that a little bit later,</p>
<p>but now that you know what hormonal headache is,</p>
<p>at least this one particular type of hormonal headache,</p>
<p>which is very, very common</p>
<p>given the number of women that are menstruating</p>
<p>and the fact that low estrogen, low progesterone</p>
<p>is the cause of the hormonal headache.</p>
<p>And the fact that, of course,</p>
<p>there are women who are no longer menstruating,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re either in perimenopause</p>
<p>and menstruation is becoming more infrequent</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re in menopause and a deceased entirely.</p>
<p>Well, now you understand</p>
<p>what the origin of the hormonal headache is.</p>
<p>And so all we need to know is</p>
<p>what do estrogen and progesterone normally do</p>
<p>in order to prevent headache?</p>
<p>And thereby, you&rsquo;ll know exactly how to offset,</p>
<p>that is prevent or treat hormonal headache</p>
<p>in that first week of the menstrual period.</p>
<p>The last type of headache that I&rsquo;d like to discuss</p>
<p>is headache associated with head hits,</p>
<p>that is traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Although I definitely want to underscore the fact that</p>
<p>even people who do not have traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>can experience headaches</p>
<p>as the consequence of hitting their head.</p>
<p>So the line between traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>and lower level brain injury</p>
<p>is one that still seeks definition.</p>
<p>And in fact, this is one of the major goals</p>
<p>of the clinical field as it relates to concussion.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s also what comes up a lot</p>
<p>during the discussion about football.</p>
<p>You know, these days you&rsquo;ll see players hit really hard</p>
<p>and depending on whether or not they&rsquo;re laying there</p>
<p>for five seconds, 30 seconds, or three minutes,</p>
<p>you know, the crowd and the people watching on television</p>
<p>and everywhere else are all speculating</p>
<p>as to whether or not the person should be allowed to play.</p>
<p>And to be quite direct,</p>
<p>there really is no way to assess the extent of brain damage</p>
<p>after the consequence of hitting one&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>or having one&rsquo;s head hit.</p>
<p>Because first of all,</p>
<p>almost all of the best ways to detect traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>except the most severe ones</p>
<p>tend to require a lot of very large equipment</p>
<p>like MRI and functional MRI and CT scans,</p>
<p>none of which are available on the side of the field</p>
<p>or in the locker room.</p>
<p>But also because many, many,</p>
<p>if not most of the effects of traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>are going to occur not in the immediate minutes</p>
<p>or even hours after the injury,</p>
<p>but several hours, days, or even weeks after that injury.</p>
<p>So this is a discussion that we should hold off</p>
<p>for a longer full episode on traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind, of course,</p>
<p>that football is this very salient example</p>
<p>of traumatic brain injury and concussion</p>
<p>as is boxing, as is even soccer with heading of the ball.</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>repeated low level impact to the forehead</p>
<p>and other parts of the head</p>
<p>can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion</p>
<p>or being quote unquote knocked out.</p>
<p>But sports related concussion</p>
<p>actually occupies just a tiny fraction</p>
<p>of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion.</p>
<p>Most traumatic brain injury and concussion</p>
<p>and low level brain injury that can accumulate over time</p>
<p>to become traumatic for sake of daily living,</p>
<p>that is lowered cognition, disruption in mood,</p>
<p>sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>is actually the consequence of things other than sports.</p>
<p>So for instance, bicycle accidents,</p>
<p>playground accidents, construction accidents.</p>
<p>And this is often forgotten.</p>
<p>And for some reason,</p>
<p>all the sports and in particular football</p>
<p>tend to grab all the attention as it relates to concussion.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while for certain people</p>
<p>is a path to a living,</p>
<p>for most people traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>is going to occur in a car accident,</p>
<p>construction work or other types of work</p>
<p>for which people generally don&rsquo;t have many options</p>
<p>in terms of the type of work that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So they are prone to concussions and head injuries</p>
<p>simply by virtue of their work</p>
<p>without any millions of dollars contracts</p>
<p>or the opportunity to necessarily,</p>
<p>some cases they do, but necessarily to do other things.</p>
<p>And certainly car accidents or bicycle accidents</p>
<p>are not voluntary events.</p>
<p>So the point being traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>and headache related traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>extends far beyond the realm of sports.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you were to look at the numbers,</p>
<p>what you find is that more than 90%</p>
<p>of traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>so people coming into the hospital or clinic</p>
<p>or people claiming that they&rsquo;ve got consistent headaches,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not sleeping well, their mood is off,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re feeling more irritable</p>
<p>after having hit their head even once</p>
<p>is not the consequence of sports.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be the consequence of accidents</p>
<p>either at the workplace or in terms of a bicycle</p>
<p>or other sorts of transportation based accident</p>
<p>like a car accident.</p>
<p>With that in mind, any kind of head hit,</p>
<p>certainly if it involves a concussion</p>
<p>or traumatic brain injury often leads to headaches,</p>
<p>either infrequent but severe headaches</p>
<p>or chronic low-level headaches</p>
<p>or a feeling that there&rsquo;s kind of a stuffiness</p>
<p>or a fullness to the head.</p>
<p>There can be a lot of different origins to that.</p>
<p>A common origin is going to be actual swelling</p>
<p>of the, not necessarily the brain tissue directly,</p>
<p>but if you recall our discussion about the meninges,</p>
<p>which include the dura</p>
<p>and the other tissues that surround the brain,</p>
<p>there are actually three layers that we call the meninges,</p>
<p>the dura just being one of them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very little space between the brain,</p>
<p>the meninges that surround it and the skull.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the subarachnoid space.</p>
<p>Very cool, right?</p>
<p>Arachnoid like spider.</p>
<p>Well, if there&rsquo;s even a slight bit of swelling in the brain</p>
<p>or even distant brain tissue,</p>
<p>so for instance, even if there&rsquo;s whiplash,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s swelling of the tissue,</p>
<p>muscular tissue and neural tissue in the neck area,</p>
<p>that can constrict the flow of things</p>
<p>like cerebral spinal fluid, blood flow,</p>
<p>and indeed mucus and other things that are essential.</p>
<p>We all hear mucus and we think illness,</p>
<p>but mucus is a vital, vital substance within the body</p>
<p>for a lot of important reasons</p>
<p>in health as well as in sickness.</p>
<p>Well, if there&rsquo;s less of that liquid and other fluids</p>
<p>and mucus being delivered to that space,</p>
<p>well, then it can clog up.</p>
<p>So sort of the plumbing is clogged up</p>
<p>or that it&rsquo;s caught at the level of the site of hit</p>
<p>or injury because there&rsquo;s some local swelling</p>
<p>and inflammation there.</p>
<p>So there are many different mechanisms</p>
<p>that can underlie headache associated</p>
<p>with head hits or traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, there&rsquo;s some recent data pointing</p>
<p>to some what I would call non-obvious treatments</p>
<p>for headache in traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>keeping in mind that anytime we&rsquo;re talking about injury</p>
<p>or disease or health for that matter,</p>
<p>mental health or physical health,</p>
<p>we have to highlight a fact that&rsquo;s going to come up again</p>
<p>and again in every single episode of this podcast.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s not being overly redundant to do so,</p>
<p>which is that regular sufficient amounts</p>
<p>of deep sleep each night are going to be important</p>
<p>for all aspects of mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and performance, and have been shown over and over again</p>
<p>to reduce the frequency of headache</p>
<p>and to reduce the time to repair</p>
<p>after traumatic brain injury and can improve cognition</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>So sleep is essential for all the normal things</p>
<p>that encourage healthy activity of the different tissues</p>
<p>that are involved in brain and body to occur.</p>
<p>So sleep deprivation, of course, is going to limit those.</p>
<p>But I do want to point out that sleep, sunlight,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked about this almost ad nauseum</p>
<p>on this podcast, but regular circadian cycles,</p>
<p>getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day</p>
<p>and in the evening as well,</p>
<p>and as much as possible throughout the day</p>
<p>without burning your skin and limiting your exposure</p>
<p>to artificial lights at night and on and on,</p>
<p>all of which is covered in the Light for Health episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>the Master Your Sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and in the Perfect Your Sleep episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>You can find all that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Getting light and avoiding light</p>
<p>at the proper times of the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>is also going to favor all the pathways</p>
<p>from gut-brain access to the inflammatory,</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory pathways, neural pathways, et cetera,</p>
<p>that, of course, if you do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to improve and offset</p>
<p>any kind of detriment caused by traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Is it treating traumatic brain injury directly?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But is not getting sufficient sleep,</p>
<p>not getting sunlight at the right times of day</p>
<p>and getting too much artificial light at night</p>
<p>going to make any impact of traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>including headache, far worse?</p>
<p>Yes, there are certainly a ton of data</p>
<p>to support that statement as well.</p>
<p>And then, of course,</p>
<p>nutrition and exercise are also important.</p>
<p>So we can list out sleep, sun, proper nutrition, exercise,</p>
<p>and I would put a proper social connection,</p>
<p>whatever that means to you.</p>
<p>Healthy social connections include romantic,</p>
<p>friendship, familial, and relationship to self.</p>
<p>Those five things, sleep, exercise, sun, nutrition,</p>
<p>and social connection are all critical</p>
<p>for maintaining baselines of health</p>
<p>and raising your baselines of health.</p>
<p>And I mentioned that, I kind of segment this out now</p>
<p>because I think that anytime</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re about to start discussing pointed treatments,</p>
<p>that is things that you can take or do to reduce headache</p>
<p>or things that you can take or do to improve anything</p>
<p>within mental health, physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>we have to remember that the foundation</p>
<p>of mental health, physical health, and performance</p>
<p>is only set at its highest level</p>
<p>by tending to those other things</p>
<p>and that nothing really surpasses any of those things.</p>
<p>Or put differently,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no replacement for any of those things</p>
<p>in the form of a pill, a powder, even a behavioral practice.</p>
<p>There are things you can do to offset</p>
<p>getting less than ideal sleep,</p>
<p>the things that you can use</p>
<p>like bright artificial lights during the day</p>
<p>to try and partially offset lack of sunlight,</p>
<p>but really there is no exercise pill.</p>
<p>There is no sunlight device,</p>
<p>although some bright lights are very bright.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no replacement for actual sunlight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no replacement for actual sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no replacement for actual nutrition.</p>
<p>And I do feel it&rsquo;s an important conversation to have</p>
<p>as we head into the next segment,</p>
<p>which is what can you take or do to reduce headache?</p>
<p>And in order to address this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to start first with the headaches</p>
<p>associated with head hits and traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>because it turns out there&rsquo;s a surprising</p>
<p>and very useful approach to doing that.</p>
<p>But this same approach also can help offset</p>
<p>and treat headache in other conditions as well.</p>
<p>Meaning not just for headaches</p>
<p>caused by traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>but also headaches caused by sudden onset tension headache</p>
<p>or migraine headache, or even perhaps,</p>
<p>again, perhaps cluster type headaches.</p>
<p>So the first substance that I&rsquo;d like to highlight</p>
<p>that has been shown to significantly reduce the intensity</p>
<p>and or frequency of headaches is creatine.</p>
<p>Now, creatine, as many of you know,</p>
<p>is something that people supplement and take.</p>
<p>Most often creatine is discussed</p>
<p>in the context of muscle performance,</p>
<p>not just for people who weight lift,</p>
<p>but for people who do endurance exercise.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s often been said that five to 10 grams per day</p>
<p>of creatine monohydrate, depending on how much you weigh,</p>
<p>five to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate</p>
<p>can increase creatine phosphate stores in muscles,</p>
<p>can bring more water into muscles, can make you stronger,</p>
<p>can increase power output.</p>
<p>And that is all true.</p>
<p>That is all completely true.</p>
<p>We discussed this in the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>with Dr. Andy Galpin when he was a guest</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Series.</p>
<p>And we discussed this extensively in an upcoming episode</p>
<p>from Dr. Andy Galpin in his special six-part guest series,</p>
<p>where he is a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the one doing the majority of the teaching.</p>
<p>That series covers everything</p>
<p>from strength, hypertrophy, endurance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an episode on supplementation</p>
<p>where we go deep into the discussion about creatine.</p>
<p>Now in that discussion, and again now,</p>
<p>we highlight the fact that creatine,</p>
<p>while most often discussed online and in the media</p>
<p>as a supplement for sports performance,</p>
<p>for the reasons I just mentioned,</p>
<p>actually has far more data behind it.</p>
<p>That is laboratory studies exploring the role of creatine</p>
<p>in the clinical setting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to highlight a paper from that literature now</p>
<p>that will make very clear as to why creatine is interesting</p>
<p>and in fact, very effective for treating headache,</p>
<p>in particular, headache caused by head hits</p>
<p>or traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Prevention of Traumatic Headache, Dizziness, and Fatigue</p>
<p>with Creatine Administration.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind, this is a pilot study.</p>
<p>It was performed in humans.</p>
<p>So when you hear the words preclinical,</p>
<p>that is if you hear there was a preclinical study on blank,</p>
<p>that means almost always that the study was performed</p>
<p>on animal models, mice, rats, primates, et cetera.</p>
<p>A clinical trial is something that&rsquo;s carried out on humans.</p>
<p>And a pilot study means that the study was carried out</p>
<p>on humans, but on a fairly small cohort,</p>
<p>a fairly small group or limited number of subjects.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if the data are robust,</p>
<p>as it is in this case of this paper,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>So in this study,</p>
<p>what they looked at was creatine administration.</p>
<p>So what they did is they had people ingest</p>
<p>a certain amount of creatine, I&rsquo;ll tell you in a moment,</p>
<p>in fluid, so it could be taken in water or milk</p>
<p>with or without food.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really matter what time of day.</p>
<p>They had people take creatine.</p>
<p>Why would they have people take creatine</p>
<p>after traumatic brain injury?</p>
<p>And in particular for people that are suffering</p>
<p>from headache, dizziness, fatigue, et cetera.</p>
<p>The reason is that neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>rely very heavily on the regulation of calcium</p>
<p>in order to generate those action potentials</p>
<p>to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a motor neuron,</p>
<p>a sensory neuron, or a modulatory neuron,</p>
<p>they all generate action potentials</p>
<p>or something similar to it.</p>
<p>And calcium is important for that process.</p>
<p>Calcium becomes dysregulated after traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>in a number of different ways,</p>
<p>in particular in ways that impact</p>
<p>the energy production systems of cells</p>
<p>that are related to ATP, adenosine triphosphate.</p>
<p>For those aficionados out there that want to look it up,</p>
<p>you can simply look up calcium, ATP, and neurons,</p>
<p>and you can learn about that cycle.</p>
<p>Creatine can be stored in muscles as we talked about before,</p>
<p>but creatine, and in particular,</p>
<p>the phosphorylated form of creatine,</p>
<p>which is the readily available fuel source form of creatine,</p>
<p>can also be stored in brain tissue.</p>
<p>And it is actually quite prominently stored</p>
<p>in the forebrain, the area where the real estate</p>
<p>of your brain just behind the forehead,</p>
<p>which is involved in planning and action</p>
<p>and understanding context.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important for cognition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for personality too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important for a number of different aspects of life</p>
<p>that have to do with making plans,</p>
<p>being able to focus very intensely on your work, et cetera,</p>
<p>or on anything for that matter,</p>
<p>all functions that become heavily disrupted</p>
<p>in people who have traumatic brain injury and concussion.</p>
<p>Creatine&rsquo;s ability to communicate with the calcium</p>
<p>and the ATP system was the motivation behind this study.</p>
<p>That is, the authors hypothesized on the basis</p>
<p>of preclinical data in animals</p>
<p>that by increasing creatine stores within the brain,</p>
<p>not just in the muscle, but in particular within the brain,</p>
<p>that the availability of creatine would allow</p>
<p>for better cognitive function in general.</p>
<p>Now they didn&rsquo;t look at cognition specifically</p>
<p>in this paper, but they did look at the other aspects.</p>
<p>That is the bad stuff associated with TBI.</p>
<p>And they had people supplement with creatine</p>
<p>at a level that is much higher than the typical level</p>
<p>that people supplement with creatine</p>
<p>simply for sports performance.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned before, most people,</p>
<p>if they supplement with creatine for sports performance,</p>
<p>they take creatine monohydrate,</p>
<p>typically five grams per day,</p>
<p>sometimes 10 grams per day,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re about 100 kilograms or greater in body weight.</p>
<p>100 kilograms is approximately 220 pounds.</p>
<p>So the dosage that was used for supplementing creatine</p>
<p>in this study to address the potential impact of creatine</p>
<p>on headache, dizziness, and fatigue was quite a bit higher</p>
<p>than the dosages used simply for muscle performance.</p>
<p>In this study, they had people take a dose of 0.4 grams</p>
<p>of creatine monohydrate per kilogram of body weight.</p>
<p>So for somebody that weighs 100 kilograms or 220 pounds,</p>
<p>that would be 40 grams of creatine per day.</p>
<p>If someone weighs half that much,</p>
<p>they would take 20 grams of creatine per day.</p>
<p>And they did that over a period of six months.</p>
<p>And we know that when you take creatine</p>
<p>over and over day to day,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a buildup of creatine stores,</p>
<p>both in the muscles and within the brain tissue.</p>
<p>Now, what they found as a consequence</p>
<p>of this creatine administration was really striking.</p>
<p>And I think quite exciting.</p>
<p>They found a very significant decrease</p>
<p>in the frequency of headache in people</p>
<p>that were supplementing with creatine</p>
<p>as opposed to the controls.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that this is a pilot study,</p>
<p>but the effects are very dramatic.</p>
<p>They found a very statistically significant decrease</p>
<p>in the frequency of headache</p>
<p>in people that were taking creatine.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the controls</p>
<p>and you see that they&rsquo;re basically getting headache</p>
<p>at a frequency of 90% or more after TBI,</p>
<p>the reduction in headache frequency</p>
<p>is down to about 10 or 12% in the people taking creatine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s quite a dramatic effect.</p>
<p>And if you look at the other measures they took,</p>
<p>keep in mind, again, this is a pilot study,</p>
<p>so a limited number of subjects,</p>
<p>but again, the results are very impressive.</p>
<p>What they found is that the number</p>
<p>of people experiencing dizziness</p>
<p>was significantly reduced</p>
<p>in people supplementing with creatine</p>
<p>as was the number of people experiencing fatigue,</p>
<p>kind of acute fatigue and chronic fatigue.</p>
<p>Again, not chronic fatigue syndrome per se,</p>
<p>but chronic fatigue, which was in this study</p>
<p>defined as a general sense of bodily weakness</p>
<p>and even mental weakness.</p>
<p>Mental weakness is a little bit hard to quantify,</p>
<p>but they were very careful to distinguish</p>
<p>between cognitive and mental fatigue</p>
<p>versus physical and somatic fatigue.</p>
<p>They acknowledged that both of those occur in TBI</p>
<p>or post-TBI, that headache is quite frequent.</p>
<p>Basically, the takeaway of the study</p>
<p>is that for people experiencing headache,</p>
<p>dizziness, and fatigue due to TBI,</p>
<p>and perhaps, and I want to underline perhaps</p>
<p>because it hasn&rsquo;t really been explored yet,</p>
<p>but perhaps headache, dizziness, and fatigue</p>
<p>due to other conditions, symptoms, or causes of headache,</p>
<p>creatine monohydrate supplementation might be,</p>
<p>again, might be an excellent candidate for people to try.</p>
<p>Why do we say that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all,</p>
<p>creatine monohydrate is relatively inexpensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s considered safe at the dosages used in this study</p>
<p>and certainly for sports performance as well.</p>
<p>And there are very few other compounds</p>
<p>that have been shown to have as significant an impact</p>
<p>on headache over the long-term</p>
<p>as has creatine monohydrate</p>
<p>in these studies of people with TBI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that many, many people suffer from TBI,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>and as now, there are very few treatments for TBI.</p>
<p>You tend to get the basic advice coming back,</p>
<p>and again, I think it&rsquo;s excellent advice.</p>
<p>You know, get proper amounts of sleep, get exercise,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t get another traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obvious, but you&rsquo;d be surprised</p>
<p>how many people go right back to work because they have to,</p>
<p>and, you know, we have to be sympathetic</p>
<p>to the fact that many people just can&rsquo;t stop working</p>
<p>or go on disability.</p>
<p>So many people have to go back to work.</p>
<p>That could be sport or it could be other kind of work</p>
<p>where they are then subject to perhaps getting more TBI.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re getting less rest as a consequence and stress.</p>
<p>Obviously, stress is a confounding issue for TBI,</p>
<p>but sleep, exercise, sun, nutrition,</p>
<p>all of those things, proper social connection</p>
<p>are what people are encouraged to do when they have TBI,</p>
<p>but there have been very few compounds,</p>
<p>in particular, very few over-the-counter compounds</p>
<p>that are known to be safe</p>
<p>that have shown efficacy in dealing with TBI.</p>
<p>So I think that while this is a pilot study</p>
<p>and we can consider it preliminary,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important enough</p>
<p>and the effects were dramatic enough</p>
<p>that people with headache,</p>
<p>and in particular, people with TBI,</p>
<p>ought to consider supplementing with creatine</p>
<p>in order to deal with their headaches.</p>
<p>And of course, I eagerly await other studies</p>
<p>exploring the role of this high dosage of creatine,</p>
<p>or I should say relatively high dosage</p>
<p>of creatine monohydrate for offsetting headache.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I think there are a number of people out there</p>
<p>suffering from headache</p>
<p>who might consider using creatine monohydrate</p>
<p>in an exploratory fashion</p>
<p>and seeing whether or not it helps offset their headaches.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, of course,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re going to add or remove anything,</p>
<p>supplement or otherwise from your treatment,</p>
<p>your nutrition, et cetera,</p>
<p>I do suggest that you consult with your physician,</p>
<p>in particular, if you have chronic headaches.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that to protect me.</p>
<p>I say that, of course, to protect you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,</p>
<p>however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids, and hormones, and so forth,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with those data.</p>
<p>InsideTracker solves that problem</p>
<p>and makes it very easy for you to understand</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,</p>
<p>maybe even supplementation-based interventions</p>
<p>you might want to take on</p>
<p>in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,</p>
<p>hormones, lipids, and other things</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>to bring those numbers into the ranges</p>
<p>that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.</p>
<p>InsideTracker&rsquo;s ultimate plan</p>
<p>also now includes a measure of apolipoprotein B.</p>
<p>Apolipoprotein B, sometimes also called ApoB,</p>
<p>has emerged in recent years</p>
<p>as among the most important measures</p>
<p>to evaluate your overall levels of cardiovascular health</p>
<p>and health overall,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because apolipoprotein B levels</p>
<p>are predictive of cardiovascular function, disease,</p>
<p>and things that cardiovascular function and disease</p>
<p>can impinge on, including brain health and longevity.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;d like to discuss next I find extremely exciting.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m about to describe is a compound,</p>
<p>or I should say a set of compounds</p>
<p>that are available over the counter</p>
<p>that have been shown to be very effective</p>
<p>in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches,</p>
<p>and not just one kind of headache,</p>
<p>but multiple types of headaches.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ll describe has been shown</p>
<p>to have significant effects in reducing the intensity</p>
<p>or frequency of tension-type headaches,</p>
<p>migraine-type headaches,</p>
<p>as well as hormone-type headaches</p>
<p>that are related to the menstrual cycles</p>
<p>that I described earlier.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of data</p>
<p>centered around this general topic,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to focus on three main papers.</p>
<p>What I haven&rsquo;t told you yet, of course,</p>
<p>is what is the compound that I&rsquo;m referring to?</p>
<p>What is this over-the-counter compound?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out this over-the-counter compound</p>
<p>is not just available over the counter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also available in food.</p>
<p>So it turns out that nutrition can have a very strong impact</p>
<p>on the frequency and intensity of headache,</p>
<p>although supplementation with this particular compound</p>
<p>can accomplish the same thing as well.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to here are omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar</p>
<p>with omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>These are fatty acids that come in the form</p>
<p>of so-called EPA and DHA,</p>
<p>and omega-3 fatty acids are commonly distinguished</p>
<p>from the so-called omega-6 fatty acids.</p>
<p>Omega-6 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods,</p>
<p>and they, of course, can be supplemented as well.</p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods</p>
<p>and can be supplemented as well.</p>
<p>Common forms of omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>or I should say common sources of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>in foods include fatty ocean fish,</p>
<p>including salmon, salmon skins, sardines, anchovies,</p>
<p>things of that sort.</p>
<p>Common sources in supplement form</p>
<p>are so-called fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil.</p>
<p>Again, omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>and almost always when we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about a combination of EPA and DHA,</p>
<p>but really it is the quantity of EPA omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>that seems to be the most impactful</p>
<p>for the sorts of health metrics</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Now, with respect to omega-6 fatty acids,</p>
<p>the most typical food sources of omega-6 fatty acids</p>
<p>are seed oils.</p>
<p>I know nowadays seed oils have become quite controversial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given my stance on this in a prior podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just repeat it</p>
<p>for those of you that haven&rsquo;t heard it.</p>
<p>I am not of the belief that all seed oils are bad,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re all inflammatory,</p>
<p>that they are killing us or making us sick,</p>
<p>that they are the major cause</p>
<p>of metabolic dysfunction, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, I think it is very clear,</p>
<p>and I learned this from Dr. Lane Norton</p>
<p>when he was a guest on this podcast</p>
<p>and taught us all about nutrition in great depth.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that episode</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in nutrition,</p>
<p>that people are consuming a lot more oil generally,</p>
<p>and a lot of those oils</p>
<p>that people are consuming more of nowadays</p>
<p>include a lot of the so-called omega-6 fatty acids,</p>
<p>and a lot of those oils are seed oils.</p>
<p>The particular omega-6 fatty acid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be relevant for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>is linoleic acid,</p>
<p>and that is common in a lot of seed oils.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you</p>
<p>that seed oils are bad.</p>
<p>However, it does seem to be the case</p>
<p>that many people are consuming far too many seed oils,</p>
<p>and in doing so are consuming far too many calories,</p>
<p>and perhaps are consuming too much</p>
<p>of the omega-6 fatty acids</p>
<p>relative to the omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>Now, with that said,</p>
<p>I think there is general agreement</p>
<p>among nutritionists and health professionals</p>
<p>that we could all stand to get more omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>perhaps for cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s a little bit debated,</p>
<p>but certainly for immune system function,</p>
<p>for mood and for functioning of the brain,</p>
<p>for the potent anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3.</p>
<p>So again, omega-3s can be sourced from food,</p>
<p>both animal-based and plant-based.</p>
<p>You can simply go online</p>
<p>and look up the various food-based sources,</p>
<p>but in thinking about headache</p>
<p>and different treatments for headache,</p>
<p>there are some recent studies exploring</p>
<p>how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>and in one case,</p>
<p>how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>and deliberately reducing the amount of linoleic acid,</p>
<p>the omega-6 fatty acids,</p>
<p>how that can impact headache.</p>
<p>So the first study I&rsquo;d like to describe</p>
<p>in reference to the role of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>in headache was published in 2018,</p>
<p>and the title of the paper is</p>
<p>Long-Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Headache</p>
<p>in the U.S. Population.</p>
<p>There are a number of things</p>
<p>that I really like about this study.</p>
<p>A few of those include the fact</p>
<p>that they looked at an enormous number of people,</p>
<p>that is, they included 12,317 men and women.</p>
<p>I like the fact that they included men and women</p>
<p>in the study, age 20 or older,</p>
<p>and that they broke down the population</p>
<p>into categories that included age.</p>
<p>They certainly looked at race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>They looked at educational background.</p>
<p>They looked at body mass, total energy intake,</p>
<p>which is really important.</p>
<p>If you think about it,</p>
<p>people are going to be eating,</p>
<p>and within the things that they eat,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be consuming some omega-3s, hopefully,</p>
<p>as well as some omega-6s,</p>
<p>and if they&rsquo;re eating far more,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re going to get far more of,</p>
<p>likely going to get far more of both of those things</p>
<p>than they would ordinarily</p>
<p>if they were eating smaller amounts.</p>
<p>So they controlled for total caloric intake</p>
<p>in a way that I find particularly useful</p>
<p>for looking at these kind of data.</p>
<p>So the reason they explored omega-3s is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are known</p>
<p>to have an anti-inflammatory effect.</p>
<p>That anti-inflammatory effect is mediated</p>
<p>through a couple of different pathways.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t go into these in too much detail now,</p>
<p>but the omega-3 fatty acids, keep in mind,</p>
<p>actually make up various parts of cells</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The membrane, remember I talked before</p>
<p>about how steroid hormones can go through</p>
<p>the different membranes of the cells,</p>
<p>the outer membrane and the inner membrane.</p>
<p>A lot of those actual membranes,</p>
<p>the structural constituents of neurons and other cells</p>
<p>are actually made up of or include certain fatty acid,</p>
<p>long-chain fatty acids,</p>
<p>and the omega-3 fatty acids are important</p>
<p>for the actual construction of those tissues,</p>
<p>as well as having anti-inflammatory effects</p>
<p>through things like limiting prostaglandins</p>
<p>and other things that can cause inflammation.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are a bunch of different ways</p>
<p>that omega-3 fatty acids can be useful.</p>
<p>They refer in this study to an earlier study</p>
<p>that looked at the so-called analgesic effect,</p>
<p>the pain-relieving effect.</p>
<p>Analgesic means pain-relieving effect</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>in what had been a randomized control trial.</p>
<p>And in that previous paper,</p>
<p>what they found was that diets high in omega-3s</p>
<p>and low in omega-6s, okay, so high three, low six,</p>
<p>and as compared to diets that were just reduced omega-6s,</p>
<p>they found a greater analgesic effect</p>
<p>of increasing omega-3s</p>
<p>while also reducing omega-6 fatty acids.</p>
<p>So in the context of the seed oil discussion,</p>
<p>although keeping in mind that omega-6s</p>
<p>can come from other sources as well,</p>
<p>if omega-6s were just reduced on their own,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t as great an effect</p>
<p>in terms of reducing pain and inflammation</p>
<p>as there was when omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>were deliberately increased</p>
<p>and omega-6 fatty acids were reduced.</p>
<p>Again, in all of these studies,</p>
<p>because these are the ones in which they</p>
<p>controlled things well, as we say,</p>
<p>they are holding constant the caloric intake.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that you&rsquo;re removing fat, eating less fat,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually a removal of certain fats and fatty acids</p>
<p>and a replacement of those with omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>In one case, in the other case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a reduction in omega-6s</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re using other food types and macronutrients</p>
<p>to offset that reduction in calories</p>
<p>caused by reducing omega-6s.</p>
<p>The basic takeaway that they&rsquo;re relying on</p>
<p>marching into the study is that</p>
<p>increasing omega-3s and reducing omega-6s</p>
<p>seems to be beneficial for reducing pain.</p>
<p>And indeed, in this study,</p>
<p>they find something quite similar,</p>
<p>which is that when you hold caloric intake constant</p>
<p>and when you look at omega-6s,</p>
<p>whether or not you decrease omega-6 fatty acids or not,</p>
<p>you find is that increasing omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>in the diet, so either consumed through food sources</p>
<p>or by supplementation,</p>
<p>was associated with a lower prevalence</p>
<p>of severe headache or migraine.</p>
<p>So severe tension type headache or migraine.</p>
<p>So this is promising and points to the fact</p>
<p>that long chain omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>are likely to have either a pain reducing,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s evidence for that,</p>
<p>and or an inflammation reducing effect</p>
<p>that can significantly reduce the severity of headache</p>
<p>in both tension type headache and in migraine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first study.</p>
<p>The second study is a more recent study</p>
<p>is published in 2021 that used a,</p>
<p>I would say a more or less similar type of overall design</p>
<p>as the one I referred to earlier.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Dietary Alteration of what they call N3,</p>
<p>but those are omega-3 and N6, omega-6,</p>
<p>sorry for the shift in nomenclature,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t write the paper.</p>
<p>Dietary Alteration of Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids</p>
<p>for Headache Reductions in Adults with Migraine.</p>
<p>And this was a randomized control trial.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials</p>
<p>involve having people be in one condition</p>
<p>where they do one thing</p>
<p>and then they get swapped randomly into another condition.</p>
<p>So they serve as their own internal control</p>
<p>and that controls for all sorts of things</p>
<p>like differences in sex, differences in age,</p>
<p>differences in health background</p>
<p>and any number of other variables as best as one can.</p>
<p>In this study, they had people either ingest a diet</p>
<p>that had increased omega-3s,</p>
<p>so increased EPA and DHA,</p>
<p>or increased EPA and DHA</p>
<p>and reduced amounts of linoleic acid, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to reduce omega-6s.</p>
<p>Or a control diet in which they had people taking</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s essentially the average intake</p>
<p>of omega-3s and omega-6s.</p>
<p>And you can probably already guess</p>
<p>what the general results of the study are going to be.</p>
<p>The general results were</p>
<p>that there were reductions in headaches, okay?</p>
<p>The really cool thing is</p>
<p>is it was a massive reduction in headache, okay?</p>
<p>This was, they refer to it</p>
<p>as a robust reduction in headache,</p>
<p>in particular for the subjects</p>
<p>that increased their omega-3s</p>
<p>and reduced the amount of linoleic acid that they took.</p>
<p>The other thing that I really like about this study</p>
<p>is that while they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the exact underlying mechanism for the effect,</p>
<p>they did spend some time delineating what it is</p>
<p>that the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids</p>
<p>are likely doing to either offset or exacerbate headache.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t say that omega-6 fatty acids</p>
<p>exacerbate headache,</p>
<p>but it does seem that people</p>
<p>who ingest more linoleic acid than omega-6</p>
<p>are experiencing more inflammation.</p>
<p>And that is evident in a bunch of different conditions.</p>
<p>One, for instance, is increases in things like CGRP.</p>
<p>CGRP is a molecule that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with a calcium signaling pathway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in vasodilation,</p>
<p>the expansion of the blood vessels and capillaries.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s known, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>to exacerbate certain forms of headache.</p>
<p>There are also forms of headache</p>
<p>that can be caused by vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about one very dramatic example,</p>
<p>perhaps, as we get toward the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very uncommon example,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called the thunderclap headache.</p>
<p>And trust me, you do not want a thunderclap headache.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll talk about thunderclap headache</p>
<p>a little bit later.</p>
<p>That involves constriction of the blood vessels.</p>
<p>In any case, in this paper,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t study mechanism directly,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re resting on this known analgesic, anti-pain,</p>
<p>as well as known anti-inflammatory pathways</p>
<p>related to increasing omega-3 intake,</p>
<p>and simultaneously resting on the idea,</p>
<p>or I think we now can say conclusion,</p>
<p>that omega-6 fatty acids, in particular linoleic acid,</p>
<p>can increase inflammation by way of increasing things</p>
<p>like CGRP, vasodilation, and some other pathways</p>
<p>related to the so-called inflammatory cytokine pathways.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole discussion nowadays</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called the inflammatome.</p>
<p>So the basic takeaway is that</p>
<p>if you are interested in reducing headache,</p>
<p>it may be beneficial,</p>
<p>at least according to these two studies,</p>
<p>and another one I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>to increase amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>And that can be done, again,</p>
<p>through the ingestions of foods.</p>
<p>Although, based on the dosages</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>increasing omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>by taking liquid form fish oil,</p>
<p>which is perhaps the most cost-effective way</p>
<p>to supplement omega-3s,</p>
<p>or capsules, which is perhaps the most efficient way</p>
<p>to supplement omega-3s,</p>
<p>really to a level of one gram or more of EPA per day.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s the EPA form in particular.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re, for instance, taking supplemental fish oil,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re getting your omega-3s from food,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting what you determine to be</p>
<p>2,000 milligrams or two grams per day of omega-3s,</p>
<p>keep in mind that&rsquo;s going to include EPA and DHA.</p>
<p>And it does seem that getting above one gram per day</p>
<p>of EPA omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>either through food or supplements or both,</p>
<p>is going to be the critical threshold</p>
<p>for reductions in the frequency and intensity of headaches</p>
<p>that include both tension headaches and migraine headaches.</p>
<p>Now, some people will find, actually,</p>
<p>that ingesting far more omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>generally through supplementation,</p>
<p>but again, can be accomplished through foods as well,</p>
<p>can also be beneficial for other things, such as mood.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s a whole literature</p>
<p>related to effects of ingesting one to three grams,</p>
<p>again, three grams per day of EPA.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to require quite a high intake of omega-3s</p>
<p>in whatever form or supplement</p>
<p>you decide to take those into your body.</p>
<p>But that can improve mood and so forth.</p>
<p>The basic range that I was able to find in the meta-analysis,</p>
<p>so meta-analyses are where a researcher</p>
<p>will look at the results of a bunch of different studies</p>
<p>focused on the same thing,</p>
<p>look at the different strength of those studies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do all sorts of cool statistical gymnastics,</p>
<p>like remove the most potent study,</p>
<p>the one that had the greatest effect,</p>
<p>and see whether or not there&rsquo;s still an effect</p>
<p>of some treatment.</p>
<p>Or for instance, they will swap in and out</p>
<p>different studies and different combinations</p>
<p>to see whether or not any one study</p>
<p>is really leading to the conclusion</p>
<p>that a given treatment does something.</p>
<p>In any case, in the meta-analyses of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>for the treatment of headache,</p>
<p>and that includes all the different kinds of headache,</p>
<p>they found in exploring a huge range</p>
<p>of omega-3 supplementation,</p>
<p>ranging from 200 milligrams</p>
<p>all the way up to 2,000 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>it really was at the one gram or higher dosage per day</p>
<p>where the significant impact</p>
<p>in reducing headache frequency and intensity was found.</p>
<p>And just very briefly, earlier I mentioned</p>
<p>that not only has omega-3 fatty acid supplementation</p>
<p>been shown to be effective in reducing</p>
<p>the frequency and intensity of headache</p>
<p>in tension type and migraine type headache,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also been shown to improve outcomes</p>
<p>for premenstrual syndrome related headaches.</p>
<p>These are what we referred to earlier</p>
<p>as hormone-based headaches.</p>
<p>Again, the low estrogen, low progesterone</p>
<p>associated with certain phases of the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>as well as other phases of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>are often associated with headache.</p>
<p>In a study entitled</p>
<p>Effective Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Premenstrual Syndrome,</p>
<p>a systematic review and again, meta-analysis,</p>
<p>what they found, and here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing the conclusion,</p>
<p>was that omega-3 fatty acids could, yes,</p>
<p>effectively reduce the severity of PMS symptoms.</p>
<p>And one of the symptoms in particular</p>
<p>that they found that was reduced</p>
<p>was the pain-related symptoms associated with headache.</p>
<p>And they actually had some very nice hypotheses</p>
<p>as to why that likely would be.</p>
<p>And in fact, point out that in earlier studies,</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids have actually been considered</p>
<p>as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in some cases.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are prescription forms</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>And I highlight that not because I think people need</p>
<p>to run out and get the prescription form</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually quite hard to obtain and quite expensive.</p>
<p>But because I think oftentimes when we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something like omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>the fact that they are available over the counter</p>
<p>in a supplement or by liquid or available in food,</p>
<p>for that matter, leads many people to conclude that,</p>
<p>oh, you know, this is supplementation.</p>
<p>This is something that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to have relatively weak or minor impact</p>
<p>on things like headache or other health metrics.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just say that the fact that it exists</p>
<p>as a prescription drug in its highest potency form,</p>
<p>at least in my opinion, points to the potency</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids in dealing with analgesic effects,</p>
<p>that is reducing pain and anti-inflammation,</p>
<p>as well as some of the known cardiovascular improvements</p>
<p>that are associated with increasing</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acid intake.</p>
<p>Put simply, omega-3s are not just something</p>
<p>that comes from food or supplements.</p>
<p>They are also being marketed as prescription drugs.</p>
<p>So I do think they need to be considered as quite potent,</p>
<p>and at least as far as these papers that, again,</p>
<p>include meta-analyses of many other papers and data sets,</p>
<p>indicate that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>to a point where you&rsquo;re getting above one gram per day</p>
<p>of EPA is not just going to be beneficial for treating</p>
<p>and reducing the frequency and intensity</p>
<p>of one particular type of headache,</p>
<p>but many types of headaches.</p>
<p>And when you combine hormonal headaches,</p>
<p>tension headaches, and migraine headaches,</p>
<p>you account for more than 70% of the total types</p>
<p>of headaches that are out there.</p>
<p>The effects of omega-3s on cluster headaches</p>
<p>and some of the other types of headaches,</p>
<p>at least to my knowledge, have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to think that omega-3s</p>
<p>would not be beneficial for those types of headaches,</p>
<p>but at least as far as the data sets</p>
<p>we talked about here are concerned, it is clear.</p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are going to be a very potent way</p>
<p>to reduce pain and to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>in ways that can reduce the frequency and the intensity</p>
<p>of different kinds of headache.</p>
<p>Before we continue our discussion</p>
<p>about many not commonly known and yet very potent treatments</p>
<p>for different forms of headache,</p>
<p>I want to touch on a topic we mentioned</p>
<p>a little bit earlier and also provide a treatment</p>
<p>that is a way to alleviate something,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s photophobia and aura.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that earlier I referred to aura</p>
<p>as this sense that something&rsquo;s about to happen.</p>
<p>That is true, meaning that is an accurate description</p>
<p>of aura, but oftentimes people also come to understand aura</p>
<p>as feeling that something surrounds a given object visually</p>
<p>or even that people have a sense</p>
<p>that something&rsquo;s around them.</p>
<p>So again, this can be a little bit vague,</p>
<p>but this idea that aura is a sense</p>
<p>of something about to happen or that visually</p>
<p>or in an auditory way, and or maybe even in kind of a sense</p>
<p>that something is about to happen in a certain environment.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m making kind of arc shapes with my hands,</p>
<p>for those of you that are just listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making arc shapes with my hands,</p>
<p>is that aura is often described as kind of a halo</p>
<p>or a emanating out from one&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>or from something that they&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Again, nothing spiritual about this</p>
<p>in the context of the discussion about migraine</p>
<p>and headache, but rather many people experience photophobia,</p>
<p>sometimes with aura, sometimes no.</p>
<p>And I just want to touch on a couple of the mechanisms</p>
<p>by which aura and photophobia occur</p>
<p>and mention just briefly a pretty well-established way</p>
<p>that people can start to offset photophobia.</p>
<p>And again, I mentioned that</p>
<p>because many people experience photophobia in headache,</p>
<p>but there are also a number of people</p>
<p>that experience photophobia,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have intense headaches.</p>
<p>So photophobia is pretty common, pretty debilitating.</p>
<p>It actually, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>why people feel not well and need to leave work</p>
<p>or not go to school or leave school,</p>
<p>these kinds of things,</p>
<p>or lay in bed all day or dim the lights, not go outside.</p>
<p>Again, sunlight being so congruent with health,</p>
<p>you can imagine how photophobia can lead</p>
<p>to all sorts of negative downstream consequences.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is aura and what is photophobia?</p>
<p>The exact origins of aura aren&rsquo;t exactly clear,</p>
<p>but it is generally thought that what aura represents</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called spreading depression.</p>
<p>And this is not depression of one&rsquo;s mood,</p>
<p>although it can be associated with that.</p>
<p>This is depression of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>Again, neurons communicate with one another</p>
<p>by generating electrical impulses</p>
<p>that travel down the length of their so-called axons,</p>
<p>which are like little wires,</p>
<p>and then they dump neurotransmitter out</p>
<p>at the so-called synapse</p>
<p>and impact the electrical activity of other neurons.</p>
<p>Depression is a electrical,</p>
<p>or I should say a chemo-electrical,</p>
<p>is the proper term,</p>
<p>phenomenon in which the excitability of neurons is reduced.</p>
<p>So again, doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do</p>
<p>with depression as a mood state per se,</p>
<p>rather it is a reduced excitability of neurons.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been shown in some imaging studies</p>
<p>that aura is associated with a back to front,</p>
<p>so from the back of the brain to front,</p>
<p>spreading depression like a wave</p>
<p>of lowering levels of electrical excitability,</p>
<p>and because this originates in the visual cortex,</p>
<p>which is in the back,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the part of your brain</p>
<p>that is making sense of visual images</p>
<p>coming in through the eyes</p>
<p>and relayed through other stations in the brain,</p>
<p>that people will start to see a kind of halo of light</p>
<p>or that they&rsquo;ll start to feel that the light around them</p>
<p>is literally surrounding their body</p>
<p>or some other object or body that they&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>and then it spreads forward in the brain,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when it tends to stretch over</p>
<p>into other so-called sensory modalities.</p>
<p>Sensory modalities being things like touch or hearing,</p>
<p>so people will get the sense</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re kind of seeing something</p>
<p>in their periphery of their vision,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll start feeling something around them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense that something&rsquo;s about to happen,</p>
<p>so as this spreading wave of depression</p>
<p>goes from back to front,</p>
<p>people experience a number of these different</p>
<p>semi-abstract sensory phenomena that we call aura, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how aura originates.</p>
<p>Now, photophobia is a little bit different.</p>
<p>Photophobia, we now understand</p>
<p>because of some beautiful work</p>
<p>that was done at Cliff Saper&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School and some other laboratories,</p>
<p>showing that photophobia originates</p>
<p>from a specific set of neurons in the eye,</p>
<p>we call these the intrinsically photosensitive</p>
<p>melanopsin ganglion cells,</p>
<p>which is really just a mouthful of nerd speak,</p>
<p>for neurons in the eye that connect to the brain,</p>
<p>these so-called ganglion cells,</p>
<p>that respond most robustly to bright blue light</p>
<p>or other short wavelength light.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got short wavelength light</p>
<p>that is blue and greens, or short wavelengths,</p>
<p>and then long wavelength light, which is red,</p>
<p>or it can even be out past where it would be infrared.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t detect infrared consciously, other species do,</p>
<p>like pit vipers can see in the infrared,</p>
<p>they can even heat sense.</p>
<p>So short wavelength light is going to be light</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bright blue, green,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s very common in fluorescent bulbs</p>
<p>that are commonly used in household lighting</p>
<p>and workplace lighting,</p>
<p>and other forms of artificial lighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, of course, present in sunlight.</p>
<p>Sunlight includes a huge range of wavelengths,</p>
<p>including long wavelength light, of course.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen that as the reds and oranges</p>
<p>in the sunset and so on.</p>
<p>Those intrinsically photosensitive</p>
<p>retinal ganglion cells in the eye</p>
<p>respond best to bright green or blue light,</p>
<p>and they send connections</p>
<p>to a bunch of different places in the brain,</p>
<p>including the so-called central circadian clock,</p>
<p>suprachiasmatic nucleus,</p>
<p>that sets your day, night, sleep, wake rhythms.</p>
<p>This is why I encourage people</p>
<p>to view sunlight in the morning</p>
<p>to set this system in motion,</p>
<p>to avoid bright light exposure at night</p>
<p>from artificial sources</p>
<p>in order to not send wake up signals</p>
<p>from the eye to the brain</p>
<p>and then onto the rest of the body.</p>
<p>But these intrinsically photosensitive</p>
<p>retinal ganglion cells</p>
<p>are also known to connect with other areas of the brain,</p>
<p>many other areas of the brain, in fact.</p>
<p>And one of the important areas of the brain</p>
<p>they connect to as it relates to photophobia</p>
<p>is an area of a structure called the thalamus.</p>
<p>The thalamus is an egg-like structure</p>
<p>that sits in the center of the brain,</p>
<p>and it serves as a kind of a switchboard,</p>
<p>like a sensory relay</p>
<p>by which information coming from the eyes,</p>
<p>from the ears, from the touch system, et cetera,</p>
<p>are funneled into different compartments in the thalamus</p>
<p>and then sent to different other areas of the brain.</p>
<p>So think of it kind of like an old-fashioned switchboard,</p>
<p>or you could think of it sort of like in an airport,</p>
<p>you go to a particular wing of the airport,</p>
<p>then you go to a particular gate and so on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting funneled progressively</p>
<p>through narrower and narrower channels</p>
<p>until you arrive at your particular plane.</p>
<p>Much in the same way,</p>
<p>the thalamus has a bunch of different entry points.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sensory information coming in</p>
<p>from a bunch of different sources,</p>
<p>and those sources get routed</p>
<p>into progressively narrower and narrower funnels</p>
<p>to eventually arrive at the accurate place</p>
<p>for their function.</p>
<p>So these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells</p>
<p>send connections to a small but important area</p>
<p>of the thalamus called LP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s denoted L, the letter, and P,</p>
<p>lateral posterior thalamus,</p>
<p>or I should say it&rsquo;s the lateral posterior nucleus</p>
<p>of the thalamus for you aficionados out there.</p>
<p>And then the neurons in that location are going to respond.</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;re going to be activated</p>
<p>by bright blue light, green light,</p>
<p>or any kind of bright light</p>
<p>originating from artificial sources or from sunlight.</p>
<p>And the neurons there that respond to that</p>
<p>have a very interesting pattern of connections.</p>
<p>They send connections up to the so-called sensory cortex.</p>
<p>So a bunch of different layers throughout the cortex</p>
<p>that are not associated with visual perception.</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;re not associated with understanding</p>
<p>that there are shapes and contours in the environment,</p>
<p>but rather to neurons that are involved</p>
<p>in the detection of pressure, pain,</p>
<p>and other forms of sensory information</p>
<p>at the level of what?</p>
<p>The meninges.</p>
<p>And we talked about the meninges earlier.</p>
<p>So again, while the brain itself does not have</p>
<p>a sensory system to detect pain,</p>
<p>the tissues around it do.</p>
<p>And the tissues around those tissues,</p>
<p>that is the stuff around the meninges,</p>
<p>themselves can respond to pain.</p>
<p>And intracranial pressure is also relayed</p>
<p>through the meninges to our conscious awareness</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for photophobia?</p>
<p>It means that bright blue light and green light,</p>
<p>and of course light from sunlight,</p>
<p>will activate these neurons in the eye,</p>
<p>these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,</p>
<p>which then activate the lateral posterior neurons,</p>
<p>LP neurons, and those LP neurons communicate</p>
<p>with areas of the brain that are specifically tuned</p>
<p>to different sensory phenomenon, and in particular pain,</p>
<p>at the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure.</p>
<p>What this means is that when we have headache,</p>
<p>or if we simply have photophobia on its own,</p>
<p>that bright light is actually the trigger</p>
<p>for pain sensing and even the creation of pain</p>
<p>at the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure.</p>
<p>What does this mean in terms of dealing with</p>
<p>or treating photophobia?</p>
<p>Well, most people deal with photophobia</p>
<p>by deciding to turn off or dim all the lights</p>
<p>and simply getting under the covers</p>
<p>or wearing a very low brim hat and putting on sunglasses</p>
<p>and they want to lie down,</p>
<p>and sometimes because migraine can be associated</p>
<p>with nausea or even vomiting in severe instances rather.</p>
<p>But one very simple way to avoid activation</p>
<p>of these retinal ganglion cells</p>
<p>that would trigger photophobia</p>
<p>is that if you are starting to feel</p>
<p>like you have a migraine coming on</p>
<p>or you have photophobia coming on,</p>
<p>to shift to using patterns of light</p>
<p>that are in the longer wavelength domain.</p>
<p>What that means practically is shifting</p>
<p>to using very orange, ideally dim,</p>
<p>but very orange and a red light.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a call for people to go out</p>
<p>and invest in expensive red light therapies.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are some excellent case uses</p>
<p>for red light therapy,</p>
<p>particular for acne, wound healing,</p>
<p>even for improving vision,</p>
<p>especially in people beyond the age of 40,</p>
<p>for some hormone augmentation.</p>
<p>We talked all about that in the episode</p>
<p>that I did on light and health.</p>
<p>Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>everything timestamped.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about here would be simply</p>
<p>having some red light bulbs on hand</p>
<p>for any time that you need to remain awake,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re starting to experience photophobia.</p>
<p>These red light bulbs can be purchased very inexpensively,</p>
<p>you know, as party lights.</p>
<p>You can buy these online.</p>
<p>So there is no specific need to get any,</p>
<p>I would say, red light that&rsquo;s designed specifically</p>
<p>for photophobia or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>You can find the cheapest red light available out there,</p>
<p>and those will simply work.</p>
<p>The idea being that for many people</p>
<p>who are experiencing photophobia,</p>
<p>they want to reduce that feeling of pain</p>
<p>and pressure in their head</p>
<p>experienced through photophobia.</p>
<p>They also might want to stay awake,</p>
<p>get some work done and do things.</p>
<p>So operating under red light,</p>
<p>or I should say living, working, et cetera,</p>
<p>under red light would allow you to stay awake,</p>
<p>not have to hide under the covers</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re experiencing photophobia.</p>
<p>In addition, and I mentioned this</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>but many people find photophobia</p>
<p>to be a entry point or a trigger to headache.</p>
<p>So what happens is they start to experience some aura,</p>
<p>some onset of photophobia,</p>
<p>and then the photophobia itself</p>
<p>leads to this feeling of malaise</p>
<p>that then converts into headache.</p>
<p>And so while there are not a lot of clinical data</p>
<p>on this just yet,</p>
<p>an emerging idea in the realm of headache treatment</p>
<p>is the idea that if you can offset some of the early signs,</p>
<p>you can offset some of that photophobia and aura,</p>
<p>perhaps through the use of dim red lights</p>
<p>or red lights as I&rsquo;ve described a moment ago,</p>
<p>then you might be able to reduce the probability</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to have a migraine</p>
<p>or other type of headache entirely.</p>
<p>So again, no need for expensive red lights,</p>
<p>but you can find red lights very easily online</p>
<p>and simply have them on hand</p>
<p>or replace the current lights that you have</p>
<p>on your nightstand or in whatever room you happen to be in</p>
<p>with these red lights.</p>
<p>These red lights are also, I should mention,</p>
<p>very useful in limiting the amount of cortisol,</p>
<p>a stress hormone that is very healthy</p>
<p>for us to release at high levels early in the day.</p>
<p>In fact, viewing sunlight will increase cortisol levels.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another reason why what I&rsquo;m about to say</p>
<p>is relevant to photophobia.</p>
<p>But if you want to keep cortisol levels low</p>
<p>in the evening and at night,</p>
<p>and indeed you do,</p>
<p>and improve the transition to sleep</p>
<p>and indeed your sleep overall,</p>
<p>reducing cortisol at evening time and at nighttime</p>
<p>is extremely beneficial</p>
<p>and red lights will help you accomplish that.</p>
<p>I talked about that in the episode on light and health.</p>
<p>So the point here is that</p>
<p>if you suffer from photophobia with or without aura,</p>
<p>using red lights and not simply dimming</p>
<p>ordinary artificial lights</p>
<p>or feeling that you have to turn off all lights entirely</p>
<p>is going to be one relatively inexpensive,</p>
<p>or I should say very inexpensive in some cases,</p>
<p>because these red lights</p>
<p>can be found very inexpensively online,</p>
<p>way to be able to continue with your daily activities,</p>
<p>at least in an indoor environment</p>
<p>if you are suffering from photophobia.</p>
<p>So shifting back to ways to reduce the intensity</p>
<p>and frequency of different kinds of headaches,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t talked so much</p>
<p>about tension headaches specifically.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to do now.</p>
<p>As you recall,</p>
<p>tension headaches are going to be muscular in origin.</p>
<p>Again, keeping in mind that everything&rsquo;s neural</p>
<p>when it comes to pain,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s neural when it comes to everything, frankly,</p>
<p>because every organ and tissue system in our body</p>
<p>is ultimately controlled by our nervous system.</p>
<p>But tension headaches are often associated</p>
<p>with tension of the muscles that are on the skull,</p>
<p>of the jaw, of the neck,</p>
<p>and can be quite painful for many people and debilitating.</p>
<p>And the most common treatment for this</p>
<p>that most people rely on that is,</p>
<p>is to take non-steroid anti-inflammatories.</p>
<p>So things like acetaminophen, ibuprofen,</p>
<p>sometimes aspirin and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And oftentimes those can be helpful.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind, however.</p>
<p>The NSAIDs, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,</p>
<p>oftentimes will work very well at first,</p>
<p>but people quickly develop a tolerance to them,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re going to have to take more and more</p>
<p>in order to get the same effect.</p>
<p>And oftentimes they can&rsquo;t take more and more</p>
<p>because some of them are very hard on the liver.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>some of them can offset some other things</p>
<p>that you really want.</p>
<p>So for instance, it&rsquo;s now known</p>
<p>that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>can offset some of the benefits of exercise.</p>
<p>And that makes sense</p>
<p>because a lot of the adaptive benefits of exercise</p>
<p>actually come from experiencing</p>
<p>a lot of inflammation acutely.</p>
<p>That means you actually want inflammation</p>
<p>during your resistance training workout,</p>
<p>or even your endurance workout.</p>
<p>But then that inflammation triggers an adaptation event</p>
<p>or series of adaptation events</p>
<p>that leads to greater strength, greater speed,</p>
<p>more muscle, more endurance,</p>
<p>whatever it is that you happen to be training for.</p>
<p>So reducing pain can be good, of course,</p>
<p>but not if you have to take more and more of a given drug</p>
<p>that it has side effects on the liver</p>
<p>and can offset the effects of exercise and so forth.</p>
<p>The other issue with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>is that many of them simply do not work for many people.</p>
<p>Or again, they&rsquo;ll work the first time and the second time,</p>
<p>but then they stop working.</p>
<p>They also tend to lower body temperature.</p>
<p>I think most people are aware of this</p>
<p>because many of these same drugs are used</p>
<p>in order to reduce fever.</p>
<p>But if you are taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>simply to reduce your headache</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re lowering core body temperature,</p>
<p>that can have all sorts of downstream issues</p>
<p>related to sleep-wake cycles, to metabolism,</p>
<p>to immune system function more generally, and on and on.</p>
<p>For that reason, there&rsquo;s been quite a lot of exploration</p>
<p>of alternatives to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>for the treatment of headache and indeed pain generally.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re talking about headache.</p>
<p>Now, as it relates to tension headache,</p>
<p>one of the more advanced kind of modern treatments</p>
<p>that you sometimes hear about is Botox, right?</p>
<p>Botox, I think most people are familiar with</p>
<p>as the thing that people get injected into their face</p>
<p>around the eyes or around the lips or elsewhere</p>
<p>in order to quote, unquote, reduce wrinkles.</p>
<p>It was discovered some years ago</p>
<p>when Botox treatments were being done for cosmetic reasons</p>
<p>that it could often be very effective for relieving headache</p>
<p>if injected into the muscles.</p>
<p>And the way that it works is that, of course,</p>
<p>tension headache involves a tension of the muscles,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it clenching or cinching up of the muscles,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is contraction of the muscles,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s controlled by neurons.</p>
<p>Neurons, which are neuromuscular,</p>
<p>so neuromuscular neurons that don&rsquo;t form synapses</p>
<p>with or connections with other neurons,</p>
<p>they form synapses with muscle,</p>
<p>they release acetylcholine onto the muscle</p>
<p>and that makes the muscle contract.</p>
<p>This is the way you move the limbs of your body,</p>
<p>this is also the way the muscles of your head contract</p>
<p>and can give you tension type headaches.</p>
<p>Botox arises from, or is rather botulinum neurotoxin.</p>
<p>Botulinum neurotoxin is a toxin that&rsquo;s found in canned goods</p>
<p>not all canned goods, of course.</p>
<p>And what it does is it prevents a certain step</p>
<p>in the release of so-called neurotransmitter</p>
<p>in the little packets that they live in,</p>
<p>which are called vesicles,</p>
<p>little spheres of neurotransmitter</p>
<p>live at the end of neuron nerve terminals</p>
<p>and are released onto the muscle, make the muscle contract.</p>
<p>Botulinum neurotoxin cleaves a particular protein in there,</p>
<p>for you aficionados who want to look this up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really cool mechanism,</p>
<p>it cleaves something called SNAP-25.</p>
<p>SNAP-25 is involved in the fusion of those little spheres</p>
<p>with the membrane of the neuron</p>
<p>and releasing of the neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>So when botulinum neurotoxin</p>
<p>is present at the nerve muscle interface,</p>
<p>those nerves cannot communicate with the muscle.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>the muscles undergo kind of flaccid tone.</p>
<p>They just kind of relax there underneath the skin.</p>
<p>Sure, wrinkles are relieved,</p>
<p>but if Botox is injected into the muscles themselves,</p>
<p>it can provide long lasting relief</p>
<p>of certain types of headaches,</p>
<p>in particular tension type headaches.</p>
<p>So while it seems like a bit of an extreme treatment,</p>
<p>people who suffer very badly from tension type headaches</p>
<p>due to hypercontraction of the muscles of the forehead</p>
<p>or around the temples or around the jaws</p>
<p>or certain parts of the neck</p>
<p>and the muscles of the neck</p>
<p>that encroach on the back of the skull</p>
<p>or that actually connect to the back of the skull</p>
<p>can achieve tremendous long lasting relief</p>
<p>from these Botox injections.</p>
<p>Sometimes for weeks or months or even longer,</p>
<p>people go in for periodic re-ups of Botox.</p>
<p>It actually is quite safe</p>
<p>despite the fact that botulinum neurotoxin</p>
<p>is quite dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s given in very low doses and given locally.</p>
<p>So those are the only muscles affected.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how Botox is used to treat headaches</p>
<p>and is a very effective treatment at that.</p>
<p>Of course, many people I imagine are interested</p>
<p>in not just drug-based treatments</p>
<p>and not Botox type treatments for treating headache,</p>
<p>but other types of treatments for headache</p>
<p>that are of the more sort of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call them natural or non-drug treatments.</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re starting to get into the realm</p>
<p>of the kind of herbal and oil-based treatments for headache.</p>
<p>Now, I confess when I first started researching</p>
<p>this area of headache and treatment for headaches, that is,</p>
<p>I found myself approaching it with a bit of trepidation</p>
<p>because when I started to hear about essential oils</p>
<p>and about herbal medications and things of that sort,</p>
<p>I thought, okay, well, there&rsquo;ll probably be some effects.</p>
<p>I mean, admittedly, we&rsquo;ve talked before on this podcast</p>
<p>about things like apigenin.</p>
<p>Apigenin is one of the core components of chamomile.</p>
<p>And chamomile is known to make people feel</p>
<p>a little bit sleepy and can enhance sleep.</p>
<p>Well, apigenin in high concentration</p>
<p>can indeed augment sleep.</p>
<p>We talk about this in our sleep toolkit.</p>
<p>By the way, we don&rsquo;t just have episodes about sleep,</p>
<p>master your sleep, perfect your sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if you go to the hubermanlab.com website</p>
<p>and you go to the menu and you click on newsletter,</p>
<p>you can scroll down and you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>that we have a toolkit for sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s completely zero cost to access.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to sign up.</p>
<p>Although if you&rsquo;d like to sign up for future newsletters,</p>
<p>you can get those.</p>
<p>One of the key components of the toolkit for sleep</p>
<p>in addition to behavioral tools</p>
<p>and things that are not supplement-based is apigenin,</p>
<p>which is this component from chamomile.</p>
<p>So the idea that certain herbal derivatives or herbs</p>
<p>or oils could be very useful</p>
<p>for improving symptoms of whatever,</p>
<p>in this case, improving sleep with apigenin</p>
<p>is not unheard of.</p>
<p>And in fact, the data continued to be released all the time</p>
<p>that many of the things that we think of as herbal, et cetera</p>
<p>can actually have quite potent effects.</p>
<p>And so while I myself was approaching the discussion</p>
<p>about essential oils and I should say oils, right?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s to say if they&rsquo;re essential or not.</p>
<p>Oils and herbs in the treatment of headache,</p>
<p>I finished out my research on this literature</p>
<p>feeling quite, I should say, surprised</p>
<p>and as if I need to really check myself a bit</p>
<p>because what I found is that there are certain herbs</p>
<p>and oils, for instance, that far outperform</p>
<p>non-steroid and anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>for the treatment of headache.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, there are certain oils</p>
<p>that are available over the counter</p>
<p>that when looked at in many studies, meta-analyses,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you about one particular study</p>
<p>and a meta-analysis in a moment,</p>
<p>they show that they can reduce the frequency</p>
<p>and intensity of headache in a manner that far outpaces</p>
<p>what you observe with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>with apparently none of the same issues</p>
<p>associated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The first of those studies I&rsquo;d like to describe to you</p>
<p>is one that has now become kind of a classic</p>
<p>in the literature, I should say,</p>
<p>at least for those that are interested</p>
<p>in the atypical treatments for headache.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is</p>
<p>Effect of Peppermint and Eucalyptus Oil Preparations</p>
<p>on Neurophysiological and Experimental</p>
<p>Algeometric Headache Parameters.</p>
<p>Okay, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, this is an interesting study</p>
<p>because rather than look at the effectiveness</p>
<p>of peppermint and eucalyptus oil and other oils on headache,</p>
<p>what they did is because they want to look</p>
<p>at the mechanisms underlying headache,</p>
<p>which I confess I love,</p>
<p>the fact that they want to understand the neurophysiology</p>
<p>and not just get subjective ratings of headache,</p>
<p>although they did that too,</p>
<p>but they really want to understand</p>
<p>how these oils can impact things like muscular tension</p>
<p>or perception of pain.</p>
<p>What they did is they recreated headache in human subjects</p>
<p>by using tightening cuffs of the head.</p>
<p>They cut off blood supply to certain areas of the head.</p>
<p>They basically induced headache,</p>
<p>and then they measured things like the EMG,</p>
<p>the muscle response at the level of electrophysiology</p>
<p>in the muscle, and of course, subjective measures</p>
<p>of how much people perceive to be in pain or not in pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you the broad contour of the study</p>
<p>because I want to make sure that it&rsquo;s the conclusions</p>
<p>that come through most clearly,</p>
<p>and we will provide a link to the study</p>
<p>in our show note captions.</p>
<p>So what they did is they had people use</p>
<p>one of four different preparations.</p>
<p>So they had preparation one,</p>
<p>which includes some peppermint oil and some eucalyptus oil,</p>
<p>and all the details about the amount</p>
<p>and the relative percentages are in the paper</p>
<p>for you to peruse online through the link I mentioned before.</p>
<p>So they had four different groups.</p>
<p>They had one group apply peppermint oil,</p>
<p>but that peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.</p>
<p>They had another group use just peppermint oil.</p>
<p>They had another group use just tiny traces</p>
<p>of peppermint oil and smaller doses of eucalyptus oil.</p>
<p>And then they had a fourth group,</p>
<p>which was just using placebo.</p>
<p>When I say using, what they were doing</p>
<p>is they were sponge applying the oil</p>
<p>to the temples and forehead of people.</p>
<p>And then what they did is they use these different approaches</p>
<p>to measure the activation of muscles, to measure pain,</p>
<p>and they then induced head pain, they induced headache.</p>
<p>So, and they looked at the temporal muscles on the side,</p>
<p>they looked at forehead muscles, things of that sort.</p>
<p>So they use three different types of pain stimuli.</p>
<p>They looked at people&rsquo;s sensitivity</p>
<p>to experimentally induced pain</p>
<p>by either providing pressure.</p>
<p>So this was kind of a cuff around the forehead</p>
<p>or thermal pain.</p>
<p>So they actually had them basically heated up</p>
<p>at the level of the skin.</p>
<p>And actually they brought the heat up pretty high</p>
<p>to the point where people were rating the pain</p>
<p>almost to the point of excessive pain and pain limits.</p>
<p>So they obviously couldn&rsquo;t take them</p>
<p>to the point of extreme pain.</p>
<p>And they had a constriction type condition</p>
<p>in which they cut off blood circulation</p>
<p>to the pericranial muscles using an inflatable collar</p>
<p>around the cranium and they inflated that</p>
<p>to pretty high pressure.</p>
<p>So kind of a brutal experiment to be involved in,</p>
<p>but look, they&rsquo;re trying to mimic headache.</p>
<p>And I think by using these different approaches,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to mimic the different aspects of headache</p>
<p>and make sure, and here&rsquo;s the key point,</p>
<p>that every person in the study</p>
<p>is not just getting the same treatment for headache,</p>
<p>but is getting the same headache.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I think gives this study power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only way to do a study like this,</p>
<p>but it gives it a lot of power</p>
<p>in trying to understand which types of interventions</p>
<p>are going to assist in headache</p>
<p>and maybe even specific dimensions</p>
<p>of the pain and headache.</p>
<p>And basically what they found in the study</p>
<p>is that of all the treatments they used,</p>
<p>the essential plant oil preparations</p>
<p>that contained peppermint,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just mention as an aside,</p>
<p>and in other studies, menthol,</p>
<p>so these minty type essential,</p>
<p>minty type what we think of as flavors,</p>
<p>but are really aromas as well.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ll point out the mechanism in a moment,</p>
<p>they had the effect of significantly reducing</p>
<p>the intensity of the pain.</p>
<p>That is subjects could tolerate the pain far better</p>
<p>and experienced less pain subjectively.</p>
<p>And the magnitude of the effects</p>
<p>were really pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Again, I went into all of this thinking essential oils,</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s like some really woo stuff.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know about that,</p>
<p>but it turns out that these essential oils,</p>
<p>at least the ones that contain peppermint oil</p>
<p>with or without eucalyptus oil</p>
<p>perform very well in reducing pain.</p>
<p>The key takeaway from the study is,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing from the study</p>
<p>that the combination of peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil,</p>
<p>and these are basically in a ethanol suspension.</p>
<p>Again, people are not drinking these essential oils.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re applying these to the skin</p>
<p>around the area that&rsquo;s in pain,</p>
<p>in particular, the temple and the foreheads.</p>
<p>Increased cognitive performance.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t talk about that,</p>
<p>but this is the ability to maintain cognitive functioning</p>
<p>while in pain.</p>
<p>You know, here we&rsquo;re talking about headache up until now,</p>
<p>just as kind of pain,</p>
<p>but that pain can be very debilitating</p>
<p>for your ability to work and perform and do other things.</p>
<p>So this combination of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil</p>
<p>applied to the skin</p>
<p>allowed people to increase their cognitive performance</p>
<p>while under pain,</p>
<p>and it had a very muscle relaxing</p>
<p>and mentally relaxing effect.</p>
<p>Mental relaxation was of course measured subjectively,</p>
<p>but remember, one of the things</p>
<p>that led me to feature this study</p>
<p>in this episode in particular</p>
<p>is that they didn&rsquo;t just say,</p>
<p>oh, my muscles feel more relaxed.</p>
<p>They actually saw that the muscles</p>
<p>of the forehead and temples</p>
<p>and some surrounding muscles were more relaxed</p>
<p>when people had these oils on,</p>
<p>applied to their forehead and the temples.</p>
<p>Not perhaps to the same degree</p>
<p>that one would observe with Botox</p>
<p>or for the same extent or duration</p>
<p>as one would experience with Botox,</p>
<p>but much in the same way,</p>
<p>which then raises the question of,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>I mean, is this all placebo effect?</p>
<p>Well, no, because they compared to placebo</p>
<p>and they controlled for the odor, of course,</p>
<p>of the oil that was applied</p>
<p>so that everyone thought that they were getting</p>
<p>essentially the same thing, pun intended.</p>
<p>But in this case, what they found</p>
<p>is that if they applied the essential oil</p>
<p>to the forehead and temples,</p>
<p>that people experience more or less a cooling sensation</p>
<p>or they could feel as if something was happening</p>
<p>in the underlying muscle.</p>
<p>Well, what was happening?</p>
<p>We now know that menthol, peppermint</p>
<p>and other things that smell that way and taste that way</p>
<p>actually have an impact on the sensory neurons</p>
<p>at the level of the skin</p>
<p>and can actually inhibit certain sensory neurons</p>
<p>and can activate other sensory neurons.</p>
<p>Okay, so in order to understand this,</p>
<p>we have to go back to what I said</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>which is that you have motor neurons.</p>
<p>These are neurons that constrict muscles or, excuse me,</p>
<p>that cause contraction of muscles.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t constrict them.</p>
<p>They cause contraction of muscles.</p>
<p>You have sensory neurons, which sense different things,</p>
<p>light, sound, or touch.</p>
<p>And you have modulatory neurons.</p>
<p>Menthol and eucalyptus are actually known</p>
<p>to activate certain channels in the sensory neurons</p>
<p>that respond not just to touch,</p>
<p>but also the sensation of cooling.</p>
<p>Okay, so when we think of menthol and peppermint,</p>
<p>we think of kind of cool scents and flavors,</p>
<p>cool meaning cold.</p>
<p>And when we think of things like hot peppers, capsaicin,</p>
<p>we think of anything that has a hot temperature,</p>
<p>we tend to think of spicy.</p>
<p>So spicy and hot go together</p>
<p>and peppermint and menthol and cool go together</p>
<p>much in the way that the gum commercials</p>
<p>or the mint commercials would lead you to believe.</p>
<p>And in fact, they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening here is that the application</p>
<p>of these oils is very likely activating channels</p>
<p>in the sensory neurons, including the trip channels,</p>
<p>but others as well that are leading</p>
<p>to the analgesic effect by shutting down</p>
<p>the heat and pain pathways.</p>
<p>Because heat and pain,</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re not exactly the same in our nervous system,</p>
<p>they are funneled through common pathways</p>
<p>where has cooling and pain relief</p>
<p>are funneled through alternate,</p>
<p>what we call parallel pathways.</p>
<p>So the study on peppermint and eucalyptus oil preparations</p>
<p>in reducing pain of headache</p>
<p>and different aspects of pain due to headache,</p>
<p>I think are really important</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t just illustrate the fact that,</p>
<p>yes, indeed, and I&rsquo;ll go on record saying it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the data say.</p>
<p>And there are other papers to support</p>
<p>this statement as well.</p>
<p>Essential oils applied to the skin</p>
<p>can reduce the symptoms of tension headache</p>
<p>in a significant way and actually can lead</p>
<p>to some offset of some of the cognitive defects</p>
<p>seen with headaches.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s itself very impressive, I must say,</p>
<p>but surprising for me,</p>
<p>kind of put me in my place as somebody who thought,</p>
<p>oh, essential oils is going to be like, okay.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually seemed to really hold some merit.</p>
<p>And when you compare the magnitude of the effect,</p>
<p>even though this was an enormous number of subjects,</p>
<p>you compare the magnitude of the effect</p>
<p>in a paper like this or similar papers</p>
<p>on these essential oils to the impact</p>
<p>of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>And they really hold their own.</p>
<p>And in some cases exceed the positive impact</p>
<p>of anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>So for that reason,</p>
<p>I think we can look at peppermint oils</p>
<p>and peppermint and eucalyptus containing oils,</p>
<p>menthol containing oils applied to the skin</p>
<p>for the treatment of tension type headache</p>
<p>as among the more potent treatments available out there.</p>
<p>Now, another way to approach treatment of tension headache</p>
<p>is something that many of you</p>
<p>have probably heard about before.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about on this podcast</p>
<p>in previous episodes, and that&rsquo;s acupuncture.</p>
<p>We will do an entire episode all about acupuncture,</p>
<p>but much in the same way that essential oils,</p>
<p>I think for many people, not all,</p>
<p>but for many people are considered kind of a woo biology</p>
<p>or people think of it as very alternative medicine.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that as the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>of things like these peppermint oils</p>
<p>are starting to be discovered</p>
<p>or omega-3s are starting to be discovered,</p>
<p>mechanistically, they hold up very well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a logic there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an underlying understanding</p>
<p>of not just why they should work,</p>
<p>but in many cases, how they work.</p>
<p>In the same way, acupuncture,</p>
<p>which of course has existed for thousands of years,</p>
<p>has been used very successfully to treat headache</p>
<p>and other forms of pain,</p>
<p>so much so that many insurance companies</p>
<p>will now pay for acupuncture as an insured practice,</p>
<p>not all, but many will.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>the scientific community is starting to understand</p>
<p>mechanistically how acupuncture works.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to make this the major focus for now,</p>
<p>but very briefly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a laboratory at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>run by Chufu Ma.</p>
<p>Chufu is well-known in the neuroscience community</p>
<p>for doing excellent work</p>
<p>in parsing the mechanisms of touch sensation</p>
<p>and pain in particular.</p>
<p>So not just touch at the level of skin,</p>
<p>but pain and pain pathways.</p>
<p>And in recent years,</p>
<p>his laboratory has started to do studies</p>
<p>on how acupuncture works</p>
<p>because indeed acupuncture has been known to work</p>
<p>to alleviate pain for a long time,</p>
<p>but the underlying mechanisms haven&rsquo;t been clear.</p>
<p>What Chufu&rsquo;s lab has published now</p>
<p>in excellent journals like Nature, Science,</p>
<p>and other journals is that</p>
<p>the precise insertion sites of different needles</p>
<p>lead to activation of sensory neurons</p>
<p>and their downstream pathways</p>
<p>in ways that can potently reduce inflammation</p>
<p>and that can be used to potently reduce the activity</p>
<p>of certain muscles.</p>
<p>For instance, muscles in the forehead and temples.</p>
<p>So when you hear acupuncture can reduce pain,</p>
<p>I think some people think,</p>
<p>oh, well, if there&rsquo;s needles sticking out of your face,</p>
<p>first of all, that must hurt.</p>
<p>And actually the needles are very fine needles</p>
<p>and skilled acupuncturists can insert them</p>
<p>without any pain or actually the person receiving it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even usually recognize that the needles are in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how quickly and efficiently they can put them in</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t detect any pain.</p>
<p>But that has been shown to greatly reduce pain</p>
<p>in particular headache-related pain</p>
<p>and back-related pain and some other forms of pain.</p>
<p>Chufu&rsquo;s lab has shown</p>
<p>that the specific needle insertion sites</p>
<p>can activate the sensory pathways</p>
<p>and can deactivate the sensory motor pathways.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re familiar with sensory neurons,</p>
<p>motor neurons, and modulatory neurons,</p>
<p>and can modulate the activity of the pain pathways</p>
<p>by way of impacting the activity</p>
<p>of all sorts of different organs,</p>
<p>including organs that give rise</p>
<p>to some of the inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>So basically what I&rsquo;m saying here</p>
<p>is that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture</p>
<p>and the maps of different insertion sites,</p>
<p>we now know, or I should say people have long known</p>
<p>and people in the West are starting to adopt</p>
<p>the understanding that acupuncture, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>it really does work for relieving pain.</p>
<p>And laboratories, both in the United States,</p>
<p>which is Chufu&rsquo;s, and elsewhere</p>
<p>are starting to find the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>And those mechanisms include deactivation</p>
<p>of the pain pathways,</p>
<p>activation of some of the parallel pathways</p>
<p>that assist in shutting down pain</p>
<p>or in relaxing the muscles</p>
<p>that are causing tension-type headache,</p>
<p>as well as activation of neural pathways</p>
<p>that impinge on organs that then cause</p>
<p>or reduce the release of molecules into the body</p>
<p>that give us the experience of pain.</p>
<p>So reduced inflammation, and in many cases,</p>
<p>increasing anti-inflammatory pathways.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to be sure to mention acupuncture</p>
<p>and a little bit of mechanistic understanding</p>
<p>of why acupuncture works,</p>
<p>because indeed, acupuncture is shown to be quite effective</p>
<p>for the treatment of tension-type headache,</p>
<p>and to some extent, migraine headache as well.</p>
<p>So we talked about omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>We talked about essential oils.</p>
<p>We talked about acupuncture.</p>
<p>So this episode is starting to sound like</p>
<p>alternative treatments to headache, including migraine.</p>
<p>But I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>This is not about alternative treatments.</p>
<p>Everything that I&rsquo;m talking about here</p>
<p>has a mechanistic basis.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>are approaches to dealing with headache that, yes,</p>
<p>are typically over-the-counter compounds</p>
<p>or are grounded in nutrition</p>
<p>or in the case of acupuncture, behavioral practices,</p>
<p>but that are not necessarily meant as replacements</p>
<p>for things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>or prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Of course, those things can still be taken.</p>
<p>Many people derive benefit from them.</p>
<p>But the goal is always, I believe, or I should hope,</p>
<p>for people to find ways that they can control</p>
<p>their health outcomes and reduce things like headache</p>
<p>using a minimum number of things</p>
<p>that have other side effects.</p>
<p>And that, of course, can also include</p>
<p>the use of essential oils in conjunction with things</p>
<p>like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>or the use of red light to offset photophobia</p>
<p>in conjunction with any number of different treatments,</p>
<p>either prescription or otherwise.</p>
<p>So I do want to make that clear.</p>
<p>And I especially want to make that clear</p>
<p>as I transition to the next segment</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m going to tell you</p>
<p>about herbal treatments for migraine.</p>
<p>And this is based on what I consider</p>
<p>a very comprehensive review</p>
<p>of many randomized control studies.</p>
<p>Indeed, the title of the paper</p>
<p>is Herbal Treatments for Migraine,</p>
<p>A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Studies.</p>
<p>And this was published in 2020.</p>
<p>And this contains an immense amount of information.</p>
<p>So we will provide a link to it</p>
<p>for those of you that really want to dive deep on this.</p>
<p>In this paper, they focus on a number of different reviews</p>
<p>and analyses of data focused on compounds</p>
<p>for the treatment of migraine,</p>
<p>ranging from and including things</p>
<p>like menthol and peppermint oil.</p>
<p>So we already covered that.</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t cover that again in detail,</p>
<p>but in this review,</p>
<p>they highlight the results I referred to before,</p>
<p>plus other results that show that menthol</p>
<p>and peppermint oil can be quite effective</p>
<p>in the treatment of tension-type headache,</p>
<p>and in this case, migraine headache as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting that menthol</p>
<p>and peppermint oils can be used</p>
<p>not just to treat tension-type headaches,</p>
<p>but migraine headaches as well.</p>
<p>And they look at an enormous number</p>
<p>of other types of herbal and essential oil-type treatments,</p>
<p>everything from coriander to citron to damask rose,</p>
<p>chamomile, lavender, a bunch of things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to go through each and every one of these</p>
<p>in a lot of detail.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve intended to do today,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to do now,</p>
<p>is to highlight the most potent</p>
<p>of these different treatments.</p>
<p>Again, menthol, peppermint oil being among the most potent.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a particular pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with headache.</p>
<p>And when I say that, I mean the different types of headache,</p>
<p>which includes the activation of this thing</p>
<p>that we call CGRP.</p>
<p>CGRP, again, is involved in this calcium regulation pathway</p>
<p>and leads to vasodilation of the vessels</p>
<p>and arteries and capillaries</p>
<p>in a way that can create pain</p>
<p>and this feeling of pressure inside the head,</p>
<p>which can be very uncomfortable, of course.</p>
<p>Now, earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>I mentioned that I was going to touch on caffeine.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to do that now.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I mentioned caffeine</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a sort of lore out there</p>
<p>that if you have a headache,</p>
<p>drinking a cup of coffee can eliminate that headache.</p>
<p>A few things about that point.</p>
<p>First of all, if you are somebody</p>
<p>who ingests caffeine every day</p>
<p>and you do not ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>you will indeed get a headache</p>
<p>and drinking caffeine will relieve that particular headache.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absolutely true that caffeine</p>
<p>can relieve the lack of caffeine-induced headache.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of a duh,</p>
<p>but that leads actually to a very important question,</p>
<p>which is why would that be the case?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that caffeine</p>
<p>is both a vasodilator and a vasoconstrictor.</p>
<p>How does it do that?</p>
<p>Well, one of the main ways</p>
<p>in which caffeine makes us more alert</p>
<p>is that it occupies the receptors</p>
<p>for something called adenosine.</p>
<p>Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body</p>
<p>more and more the longer we&rsquo;ve been awake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that makes us feel sleepy.</p>
<p>So when we drink caffeine,</p>
<p>that caffeine occupies the adenosine receptor</p>
<p>and the adenosine cannot have its normal effect</p>
<p>of making us sleepy.</p>
<p>When that caffeine wears off,</p>
<p>the adenosine can bind and we feel sleepy.</p>
<p>Adenosine is a vasodilator.</p>
<p>So when we drink caffeine,</p>
<p>because it blocks the effects of adenosine,</p>
<p>there is a vasoconstriction</p>
<p>associated with drinking caffeine.</p>
<p>So if you have a headache</p>
<p>that is associated with excessive vasodilation</p>
<p>and pressure in the head,</p>
<p>indeed drinking some caffeine</p>
<p>can cause some vasoconstriction</p>
<p>by preventing that adenosine pathway</p>
<p>that would normally lead to vasoconstriction</p>
<p>and you can get some relief from that headache.</p>
<p>However, caffeine is also a vasodilator.</p>
<p>Caffeine has the ability to impinge</p>
<p>on the so-called NO pathway, the nitric oxide pathway,</p>
<p>which is a nerve to blood pathway</p>
<p>that involves a few different enzymes</p>
<p>that we won&rsquo;t get into right now,</p>
<p>but maybe in a future episode,</p>
<p>that causes dilation of the blood vessels.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of a two-pronged effect.</p>
<p>Now, one of the ways in which you might think about this</p>
<p>and perhaps utilize this</p>
<p>is that if you are well-rested</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s early in the day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve had some sleep the previous night,</p>
<p>adenosine levels are very likely to be low,</p>
<p>especially if you slept very well the night before.</p>
<p>Under those conditions, when you ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>you are not going to experience</p>
<p>the vasoconstriction effects of caffeine</p>
<p>that would ordinarily be there by inhibiting adenosine.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because adenosine is not present at all.</p>
<p>And under those conditions,</p>
<p>drinking coffee ought to lead to some vasodilation.</p>
<p>Not a lot, but nonetheless, vasodilation.</p>
<p>If, however, you haven&rsquo;t slept well</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s late in the day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been up for a long time,</p>
<p>drinking caffeine is likely to have</p>
<p>more of a vasoconstriction effect.</p>
<p>And this is important</p>
<p>because some of the treatments that you hear about</p>
<p>that involve using caffeine to treat headache</p>
<p>are as extreme as, okay, if you have a headache at night,</p>
<p>drink a cup of coffee and then go to sleep.</p>
<p>I actually saw that in the literature,</p>
<p>which I couldn&rsquo;t quite believe</p>
<p>because yes, indeed, some people can fall asleep</p>
<p>after drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>but we know very well,</p>
<p>thanks to the beautiful work and science communications</p>
<p>of people like Dr. Matthew Walker</p>
<p>from University of California, Berkeley,</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s been a guest on this and many other podcasts,</p>
<p>that even if you can fall asleep after drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>ingesting caffeine within the 10 to 12 hours</p>
<p>prior to bedtime is simply not a good idea</p>
<p>because of the ways it disrupts the architecture of sleep.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the takeaway about caffeine and headache</p>
<p>and vasodilation?</p>
<p>You need to be very clear on whether or not</p>
<p>caffeine tends to remove your headache or exacerbate it.</p>
<p>Now, this is going to depend on time of day</p>
<p>and the amount of adenosine in your system,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>but also there seems to be a kind of bimodal distribution</p>
<p>whereby some people, when they drink caffeine,</p>
<p>it really improves their headache.</p>
<p>And so in some cases, very significant effects,</p>
<p>whereas other people, when they drink caffeine,</p>
<p>it really exacerbates their headache.</p>
<p>And at least as far as I could tell from the literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy to predict who those people are going to be.</p>
<p>What is reassuring, however,</p>
<p>is it does not seem to be the case</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re somebody who experiences relief from headaches</p>
<p>by drinking caffeine, that suddenly one day to the next,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to experience a worsening of your headache</p>
<p>and vice versa is also true.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that drinks caffeine</p>
<p>and your headaches get worse,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reason to think that caffeine</p>
<p>one day or from one day to the next rather</p>
<p>is going to somehow alleviate your headache.</p>
<p>So you have to determine for yourself</p>
<p>whether or not headaches are relieved or exacerbated</p>
<p>by drinking caffeine.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re wondering why it&rsquo;s so confusing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because caffeine hits both the vasodilation</p>
<p>and the vasoconstriction pathways,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing you or I</p>
<p>or anyone else can do about it.</p>
<p>Now, the last thing I&rsquo;d like to talk about</p>
<p>in terms of relief for headaches</p>
<p>is something that I&rsquo;m guessing about probably 25%</p>
<p>of you are familiar with and 75% of you are not,</p>
<p>which is curcumin.</p>
<p>Curcumin is often also referred to as turmeric</p>
<p>and turmeric is a root</p>
<p>and curcumin is one of the key components of that root.</p>
<p>Curcumin is known to have</p>
<p>very potent anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s debated at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s so potent as an anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>that some people have cautioned</p>
<p>against taking high levels of curcumin prior to,</p>
<p>for instance, resistance training workouts</p>
<p>or even cardiovascular workouts,</p>
<p>because it so prevents inflammation</p>
<p>that it also can prevent the adaptation response.</p>
<p>Because remember, the inflammation</p>
<p>that occurs during exercise,</p>
<p>both resistance and cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>is at least in part the trigger for the adaptation</p>
<p>that is going to lead to enhanced endurance,</p>
<p>enhanced strength, hypertrophy, et cetera.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, curcumin has been explored</p>
<p>in the context of treatment of migraine,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of the compounds</p>
<p>that was analyzed in extensive detail</p>
<p>in this wonderful review</p>
<p>that I mentioned a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>What I like about this study</p>
<p>is that they were able to explore the effects of curcumin</p>
<p>as explored in previous research studies</p>
<p>and compare those across a large range of different dosages</p>
<p>and a large range of combinations</p>
<p>with other things like coenzyme Q10,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast before.</p>
<p>But I think for sake of this discussion,</p>
<p>just really focusing on what curcumin does alone</p>
<p>or in conjunction with the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>is what turns out to be the most interesting.</p>
<p>First of all, curcumin has been shown</p>
<p>to be generally safe for most people.</p>
<p>At dosages as high as 8,000 milligrams per day</p>
<p>or eight grams per day.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I do not recommend that anyone take dosages of curcumin,</p>
<p>aka turmeric, that are that high.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, curcumin and turmeric,</p>
<p>not only are anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>but they also can impinge on other pathways,</p>
<p>in particular hormonal pathways.</p>
<p>And in fact, curcumin, aka turmeric,</p>
<p>can alter the synthesis</p>
<p>of something called dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>Dihydrotestosterone is involved in an enormous range</p>
<p>of different bodily functions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in libido.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in men and beard growth</p>
<p>and in the regulation of a number of different tissues,</p>
<p>both in the reproductive axis</p>
<p>and outside the reproductive axis.</p>
<p>And curcumin is a potent inhibitor of DHT.</p>
<p>So I do want to caution that people</p>
<p>who take high doses of curcumin</p>
<p>and some people who are very sensitive to curcumin</p>
<p>will even at low doses experience reductions in DHT</p>
<p>that lead to things that they would not like,</p>
<p>such as sufficient reductions in libido.</p>
<p>However, curcumin has been shown to be effective</p>
<p>as an anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>and has been shown to be very effective</p>
<p>in treating different types of headache,</p>
<p>in particular migraine headache.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which curcumin does that</p>
<p>is to inhibit this thing</p>
<p>that I talked about a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>which is nitric oxide or NO, which causes vasodilation.</p>
<p>And in doing that can reduce the feeling</p>
<p>that one has a lot of intracranial pressure.</p>
<p>Okay, so curcumin dosages come in enormous ranges</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>dosages that range anywhere from 80 milligrams taken,</p>
<p>80 milligrams per day that is,</p>
<p>taken for eight weeks time that&rsquo;s been examined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been explored at 80 milligram dosages</p>
<p>taken alongside two and a half grams</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids or omega-3 fatty acids alone</p>
<p>and against placebo.</p>
<p>And the general conclusion of these studies</p>
<p>is that curcumin when taken at dosages</p>
<p>of about 80 milligrams,</p>
<p>although for those of you very sensitive to curcumin</p>
<p>probably as low as 25 or even 50 milligrams per day</p>
<p>in conjunction with,</p>
<p>although not necessarily at the same time,</p>
<p>but taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>at two and a half grams per day</p>
<p>led to significant improvements in migraine</p>
<p>and other forms of headache.</p>
<p>Meaning both the frequency</p>
<p>and the intensity of the headaches that occurred</p>
<p>was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>One important point about curcumin to keep in mind</p>
<p>is that curcumin is known to inhibit something</p>
<p>called cytochrome P450.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s associated with an enzymatic pathway</p>
<p>and some other things that relate to blood coagulation.</p>
<p>So for people that are taking medications</p>
<p>that are anticoagulants to prevent clotting,</p>
<p>you do need to be very cautious about using curcumin.</p>
<p>And of course, with curcumin or any other supplement,</p>
<p>you should always talk to your doctor</p>
<p>prior to including it or removing it</p>
<p>from your supplement regimen.</p>
<p>So as you can see, there are a number of different things</p>
<p>that in addition to prescription drugs</p>
<p>and over-the-counter pain medications,</p>
<p>things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>can really impact the different aspects of headache</p>
<p>and different types of headache.</p>
<p>In some cases, differentially.</p>
<p>Now, today we talked mainly about tension type</p>
<p>and migraine type headaches</p>
<p>because those are the most common forms of headache.</p>
<p>There are, of course, the cluster type headaches</p>
<p>that are of neural origin.</p>
<p>Talked about hormonal headaches</p>
<p>and indeed some treatments such as omega-3s,</p>
<p>which have been shown to be beneficial</p>
<p>for offsetting the menstrual related headaches.</p>
<p>Now, in the context of the discussion about omega-3s,</p>
<p>keep in mind that omega-3s can be obtained</p>
<p>from supplementation or from nutrition.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to take omega-3 capsules</p>
<p>or liquid form omega-3s if you want to use omega-3s</p>
<p>to target different symptoms of headache.</p>
<p>But that probably is going to be</p>
<p>the most efficient way to do it</p>
<p>given that many foods do contain omega-3s,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to get above that one gram dosage.</p>
<p>And in fact, most of the studies that we talked about today</p>
<p>involved getting two or even two and a half,</p>
<p>or in some cases on this podcast with previous guests,</p>
<p>such as Dr. Rhonda Patrick.</p>
<p>She talked about the advantages of getting</p>
<p>as high as three grams of omega-3s per day,</p>
<p>which almost with certainty is going to require</p>
<p>some external form of supplementation,</p>
<p>even for those of you that are making a point</p>
<p>to eat fatty ocean fish with the skin on.</p>
<p>So I just want to make sure that I highlight that.</p>
<p>Before we wrap up, I can&rsquo;t help myself,</p>
<p>but to talk about something that I heard about</p>
<p>on the news several years ago,</p>
<p>and it sounded too outrageous to be true,</p>
<p>but then was confirmed as accurate</p>
<p>by one of my neurologist colleagues.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fact that eating certain very spicy peppers</p>
<p>can induce headache, and in some cases,</p>
<p>can induce brain damage.</p>
<p>And bear with me here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about your traditional jalapeno,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m acknowledging the fact that certain people</p>
<p>can tolerate far more spicy tastes than do others.</p>
<p>Some people are very sensitive to spicy.</p>
<p>Some people can tolerate very spicy food,</p>
<p>and that one can build up a tolerance to spicy food</p>
<p>by ingesting progressively spicier, excuse me,</p>
<p>spicier and spicier foods over time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are these pepper eating contests</p>
<p>out there that, while not very common, do exist,</p>
<p>and people challenge each other to eat peppers</p>
<p>of extreme spiciness.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one in particular that&rsquo;s referred to</p>
<p>as the Carolina Reaper.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s not a person, as far as I know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pepper, the Carolina Reaper,</p>
<p>which is known to have the most potent spice of any pepper.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why you would not want</p>
<p>to eat the Carolina Reaper.</p>
<p>A few years ago at one of these pepper eating contests,</p>
<p>a man ate a Carolina Reaper as part of the competition</p>
<p>and suddenly experienced what&rsquo;s called thunderclap headache.</p>
<p>Thunderclap headache is a unique type of headache,</p>
<p>very different from all the other types of headache.</p>
<p>It is not from the surface in,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not tension headache.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even the cluster type headache</p>
<p>of the nerve activation of the trigeminal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a hyper constriction of the vasculature</p>
<p>in the brain caused by the ingestion of the pepper,</p>
<p>an inflammatory response.</p>
<p>And remember that heat and spicy go together</p>
<p>in these neural pathways.</p>
<p>And a bunch of different heat-related</p>
<p>and spice-related pathways get activated simultaneously</p>
<p>when one ingests something of extreme spice.</p>
<p>And the blood vessels,</p>
<p>and indeed some of the smaller arteries</p>
<p>feeding neural tissue shut down.</p>
<p>And he experienced this thunderclap headache,</p>
<p>which is a brutal headache.</p>
<p>And sadly, in his case, permanent brain damage,</p>
<p>so loss of neuronal tissue</p>
<p>because neuronal tissue is very metabolically active.</p>
<p>You cut off the blood supply to that tissue.</p>
<p>Not only would you feel miserable, maybe even pass out,</p>
<p>but lose vision and certain brain areas will actually die off</p>
<p>in the absence of a blood flow to those areas.</p>
<p>We know this more commonly as stroke.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to strike fear in anybody</p>
<p>about eating a jalapeno</p>
<p>or even a very spicy meal from time to time.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not somebody who&rsquo;s familiar</p>
<p>with eating very spicy foods,</p>
<p>you certainly don&rsquo;t want to enter one of these competitions</p>
<p>and just realize that the pathways from menthol and cool</p>
<p>or spicy and hot, those aren&rsquo;t just subjective pathways.</p>
<p>These are actually neural pathways that, again,</p>
<p>originate in our so-called,</p>
<p>nerds call it the sensory epithelium,</p>
<p>so our skin, our hearing, our eyes,</p>
<p>and that feed that information into the body</p>
<p>to make use of that information,</p>
<p>some case motor movement, so sensory motor.</p>
<p>In other cases, the information can be fed</p>
<p>through nerve pathways that goes to the vasculature</p>
<p>and causes the vasculature to either dilate or constrict</p>
<p>these very spicy peppers causing, as I just mentioned,</p>
<p>extreme cerebro of the head,</p>
<p>vasoconstriction and brain damage.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s not going to be a common thing out there,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, I encourage people to be very cautious</p>
<p>about the Carolina Reaper.</p>
<p>So today we talked about headaches,</p>
<p>and first we highlighted the different types of headache,</p>
<p>making it clear that understanding which headache</p>
<p>you might be experiencing can be very beneficial</p>
<p>for understanding which sorts of treatments</p>
<p>ought to be best and perhaps also best avoided</p>
<p>in trying to alleviate those headaches</p>
<p>or prevent them from happening at all.</p>
<p>We talked about tension headaches, migraine headaches,</p>
<p>hormone-based headaches, cluster headaches,</p>
<p>and traumatic brain injury-related headaches.</p>
<p>We talked about different types of treatments</p>
<p>ranging from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,</p>
<p>some herbal and indeed some essential oil treatments</p>
<p>as well as acupuncture, all of which have been shown</p>
<p>to have significant impact in reducing the frequency</p>
<p>and intensity of headaches, and in many cases,</p>
<p>reductions in the frequency and intensity of headaches</p>
<p>that are at least as great as the results</p>
<p>that are seen with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>Again, I want to highlight that none of these approaches</p>
<p>are necessarily designed to be done on their own</p>
<p>or in replacement of prescription drugs from your physician.</p>
<p>There are excellent prescription drugs out there</p>
<p>that your physician can prescribe for you</p>
<p>for the treatment of headache.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think many people</p>
<p>who are listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>are interested in the things that they can do</p>
<p>in order to inoculate themselves</p>
<p>or at least reduce the likelihood of experiencing headache,</p>
<p>especially for people</p>
<p>who are experiencing chronic recurring headaches</p>
<p>such as migraine or the other forms of headache</p>
<p>which can be so debilitating.</p>

<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct from the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter,</p>
<p>Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving sleep, hormone support, and focus.</p>
<p>Huberman Lab podcast has partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements because Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>are of the very highest quality</p>
<p>and they include single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>As I pointed out in the episode</p>
<p>about a rational approach to supplementation,</p>
<p>single ingredient formulations allow you to develop</p>
<p>the most biologically effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective approach to supplementation.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus ships internationally,</p>
<p>which is important because I realize</p>
<p>that many of you reside outside of the United States.</p>
