    <p>I just hit that so pussy. I&rsquo;m not gonna show my zazae.</p>
<p>Hi friends, so I&rsquo;m real stressed right now. I don&rsquo;t know fucking know why, but I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>real anxious. I&rsquo;m giving anxiety, but I want to talk about wanting to change yourself in</p>
<p>this week&rsquo;s episode because there&rsquo;s such a stigma around wanting to change yourself and</p>
<p>like the self-development community and everybody&rsquo;s like you need to accept yourself and love</p>
<p>yourself the way that you are. No, bitch. I don&rsquo;t want to fucking accept myself how</p>
<p>I am. So I want to break some shit down and then give you my advice on how to actually</p>
<p>change yourself. And then a lot of people have trouble with trusting their own judgment</p>
<p>if they should change something or not. Like, oh, am I going to regret it? Am I not? So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you all the ways that I go about knowing if I actually need to change</p>
<p>something or if I&rsquo;m like bugging. So all my cheat codes are coming. Just keep listening</p>
<p>to this episode. But I do want to start off with that fucking stigma and I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>shove a stick up its ass because I&rsquo;m sick of everybody saying that shit of like you</p>
<p>have to accept yourself. Like stop trying to change yourself. Girl, human beings are</p>
<p>meant to change. We&rsquo;re meant to evolve. We&rsquo;re meant to constantly be changing. Like I said</p>
<p>in my hookups episode, human beings like progression. We&rsquo;re never going to feel comfortable staying</p>
<p>the same. It goes back to like the whole desires thing. As soon as you have a new desire, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to start changing shit. It&rsquo;s like once you reach a certain goal, a new</p>
<p>one is always going to arise. So you meet a desire, you&rsquo;re always going to have another</p>
<p>one. It&rsquo;s a never ending cycle. You can&rsquo;t get rid of it. To even want to not have desires</p>
<p>is a desire, babe. So you&rsquo;re stuck with that. And the whole self love journey shit, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowed to want to change yourself. I give you permission. You&rsquo;re fully allowed to want</p>
<p>to change shit. That&rsquo;s totally fine. It&rsquo;s not self hating for you to want to change.</p>
<p>Not at all. So I&rsquo;ve said this before. I&rsquo;m someone that changes nonstop. Like I feel</p>
<p>like a whole brand new person every three months. Every three months it&rsquo;s a new Leo.</p>
<p>Every fucking three months. It&rsquo;s exhausting. It&rsquo;s draining. I get sick and tired of it.</p>
<p>All I want is to just like have some stability and be consistent. But like I said in the</p>
<p>beginning of this, that&rsquo;s not how human beings work. It&rsquo;s not how we are. So as bad as I</p>
<p>want to just like be the same, I can&rsquo;t. When you have like a heightened level of awareness,</p>
<p>good luck bitch. You&rsquo;re not going to be able to stay the same. But with going on a self</p>
<p>development journey and starting to grow, you&rsquo;re going to make a lot of mindset shifts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the biggest things that my podcast provides to people is new perspectives,</p>
<p>new lenses for life and really big mindset shifts. So the biggest thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed</p>
<p>is like whenever I make an internal mindset shift, like I drop a limiting belief or I</p>
<p>want to start something new or I just see things completely different. When you make</p>
<p>a mindset shift, you&rsquo;re going to feel like you&rsquo;ve leveled up inside internally. And when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re operating from a whole new mindset, being in the same body, doing the same shit,</p>
<p>having the same external is going to start to get like uncomfortable and feel weird.</p>
<p>Like your, your life&rsquo;s going to feel like a gaslight because internally you&rsquo;re so much</p>
<p>different, but your external is the fucking same. And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m saying you have</p>
<p>to make changes. It&rsquo;s totally fine to do that because you&rsquo;re not changing yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re helping your external match your new internal. So that&rsquo;s my biggest thing is like</p>
<p>with a new mindset shift, changes are going to come that are physical. And if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make changes, it will drive you fucking insane. Just try it. Just try it, bitch. Just try</p>
<p>and have all the mindset shifts that you can make, level yourself up mentally so much,</p>
<p>and then see how comfortable you feel staying the same way that you are. You&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to feel like a contradiction. It&rsquo;s going to feel like something&rsquo;s just off. So</p>
<p>the way that I like to look at making changes in my external, whether it&rsquo;s my body or my</p>
<p>environment is making it a match to my new mindset and who I am inside. I like these</p>
<p>things to match or else I feel very uncomfortable, very fucking weird. I don&rsquo;t have my pinky</p>
<p>ring on. Hang on. Let me get it. Oh my God. I knew I felt naked. Okay. We&rsquo;re back. So</p>
<p>getting back on track, the more you shift internally, the more of a disconnect you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to feel from your external. So wanting to change shit is normal, babe. It&rsquo;s not self</p>
<p>hate. It&rsquo;s not mean. It&rsquo;s not fucked up. It&rsquo;s not weird. You&rsquo;re going to naturally just</p>
<p>want to change shit as you level up inside. And that&rsquo;s something I carried a lot of guilt</p>
<p>for for so long. Cause like everybody preaches the same fucking shit. Like when I was going</p>
<p>through it and I was trying to like learn from people online, everybody&rsquo;s on about,</p>
<p>you have to accept yourself. You&rsquo;re perfect the way that you are. No bitch. Cause when</p>
<p>I was fat, I felt fat. I felt ugly. I felt not cute. And I felt ugly for more reasons</p>
<p>than just being overweight. I just didn&rsquo;t look good. So for someone to say you&rsquo;re perfect</p>
<p>the way that you are, I could not accept those words because I did not feel it. Like I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>accept accepting myself. I couldn&rsquo;t fucking do it because I didn&rsquo;t like how I looked.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like how I felt. I didn&rsquo;t like any of that shit. So I wanted to change it. So</p>
<p>in order for me to feel like I could truly be happy with how I was and who I was, I needed</p>
<p>to change some shit because what I felt internally was not what reflected. I didn&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>a fat piece of shit inside. I didn&rsquo;t feel ugly inside. So I had to put my ass into it</p>
<p>and like make my external cute. But a big thing that also played into the way that I</p>
<p>look and like wanting to change my appearance was the way that I was eating and the way</p>
<p>that I was living by not exercising and like eating like shit. I had new awareness in my</p>
<p>mind about how I wanted to present and how I felt about the way I had been living. And</p>
<p>I made a really big mindset shift that allowed me to truly change the way that I looked because</p>
<p>I had changed the way that I looked before, but it was never consistent. So until I like</p>
<p>truly shifted myself mentally, it just stayed the same. But I had a lot of realizations,</p>
<p>a lot of awareness and a lot of things that went into me finally changing the way that</p>
<p>I look and looking the way that I look now, which I&rsquo;m very proud of. But the whole thing</p>
<p>with acceptance, let me just hit it real quick. With trying to accept yourself when you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like yourself, a lot of people try and push you have to love yourself where you are. No,</p>
<p>you can love yourself as you progress and as you level up and as you make your external</p>
<p>a match to your internal, you will start to naturally be able to accept yourself. As soon</p>
<p>as you start making changes, just just sit still in a place and in a body that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like and try to force yourself to appreciate it and love yourself. Good luck, bitch. I</p>
<p>tried it. It&rsquo;s literally like trapping yourself in a cage of being like, be happy with being</p>
<p>in the cage. Motherfucker, I could just get out. So my thing with acceptance is you do</p>
<p>have to accept where you&rsquo;re currently at. You do not have to accept yourself and like</p>
<p>just take that and be like, ah, it&rsquo;s good enough. Don&rsquo;t try to make where you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>good enough. My whole thing with acceptance is you have to accept where you are in order</p>
<p>to be able to move forward or make a change. But you can&rsquo;t just like cover your eyes and</p>
<p>be like, no, I&rsquo;m perfect. I&rsquo;m great where I am. When internally you feel like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking like it. You have to face where you&rsquo;re truly at and it&rsquo;s going to reveal all of the</p>
<p>shit that you want to change. So that&rsquo;s where my next step comes in is stop like comforting</p>
<p>yourself when you don&rsquo;t like where you are. Stop doing it. Stop trying to force yourself</p>
<p>to love yourself where you are. Use your discomfort with where you are and what you look like</p>
<p>to put a fire under your fucking ass to change it. Because a lot of people talk about motivation</p>
<p>and they struggle with motivation, but the true fucking motivation, you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to need it because once you face the reality of where you are and you stop telling yourself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m perfect how I am when you do not feel it, you&rsquo;re naturally just going to get a boost</p>
<p>and like a desire to go change shit because you&rsquo;re no longer comforting yourself with</p>
<p>being uncomfortable. You&rsquo;re allowing yourself to be uncomfortable and using that to motivate</p>
<p>you. But like I said, as soon as you stop comforting yourself and like trying to convince</p>
<p>yourself you&rsquo;re perfect how you are and you should love yourself the way you are, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to reveal all the things you aren&rsquo;t happy with. So when I did this, I was not</p>
<p>happy with my body. I was not happy with what I was doing for a living. I was not happy</p>
<p>with my financial situation. I was not happy with where I lived, the city or the house</p>
<p>bitch. Like I had to shift everything. But the whole thing with comfort, like when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>comforting yourself, when you&rsquo;re unhappy, as soon as you stop comforting yourself, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a lot harder to not make changes. So it&rsquo;s going to feel bad to not change things</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re now extremely uncomfortable. So this is my whole little spiel about like</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a little motivation for you. But now let&rsquo;s jump into trusting yourself to make</p>
<p>changes and trusting yourself to make the right decision about what you want to do and</p>
<p>what you want to shift because it&rsquo;s very overwhelming. It&rsquo;s very, very scary to be like, okay, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>uncomfortable and unhappy with all this shit. But what now? Like a lot of people are too</p>
<p>scared to make the changes. So I get why everybody&rsquo;s stuck and the whole like comfort</p>
<p>yourself and like try to accept where you are. But I&rsquo;m going to teach you the opposite</p>
<p>because trying to comfort yourself when you&rsquo;re stuck where you are is going to limit you.</p>
<p>But the first thing you&rsquo;re going to do is evaluate what you want to change. Like get</p>
<p>clear on all the things you want to change and then you&rsquo;re going to look at why do you</p>
<p>want to change them? Like get very clear with your why because a lot of people get</p>
<p>stuck in trying to change shit so other people will approve of them and it&rsquo;s like a subconscious</p>
<p>thing. So like you&rsquo;re scared to change something cause you&rsquo;re like, is it actually what I want</p>
<p>or am I doing it for other people or like people don&rsquo;t know why they want certain things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying you have to look at the why when you find out what you want</p>
<p>to change. But I have a couple of things listed for the what for like what you want to change.</p>
<p>So I got physical appearance which also includes your style. So your body and your style. You</p>
<p>want to change that. Totally fine. Your hair. I&rsquo;m going to talk about why I shaved my fucking</p>
<p>head in a minute and how I got the balls to do it. Second is like mannerisms. The way</p>
<p>you walk, the way you move, like shit like that. Your personality, the way you talk,</p>
<p>the way you interact with other people, the way you communicate. That&rsquo;s something a lot</p>
<p>of people need to fucking change. Your intellect. Like how much you know cause you can always</p>
<p>learn more but you need to know what you want to learn more of. So that&rsquo;s something you</p>
<p>can change is like your mental capacity and also like your intelligence. You can also</p>
<p>want to change your job or what you do and your environment. Like where you live, where</p>
<p>you spend your time, your house, you know. There&rsquo;s a lot of things that you can want</p>
<p>to change. So like I just want to throw some examples of like the what because I&rsquo;ve changed</p>
<p>everything about myself. I&rsquo;ve changed the way that I walk, the way that I talk, the</p>
<p>way that I move. Like my hands, my mannerisms. I&rsquo;ve put tattoos on myself. I&rsquo;ve cut my hair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed my style. I&rsquo;ve moved to a new city. I&rsquo;ve moved to a different place. Like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved to plenty of places but I have changed everything you can possibly change.</p>
<p>So I know how to be sure and how to figure out what to change and what not to change</p>
<p>and why I truly want to change it. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to try and teach you with these</p>
<p>next couple of steps. But if you want help sorting this out and you want help with this</p>
<p>one-on-one with me, you can schedule a call to work with me. I&rsquo;ll add the link in the</p>
<p>description of this episode. It&rsquo;s going to take you to the link on my website which</p>
<p>is where you can put in an application to work with me one-on-one and we&rsquo;ll do Zoom</p>
<p>calls because I need to be able to see you. I like that. But my biggest thing with making</p>
<p>changes is you have to look at the why behind it. And I&rsquo;m going to give you an example</p>
<p>of like why I want to change certain things and when my desire to change things kind of</p>
<p>comes about. So when I decided to start doing one-on-one coaching, I felt a desire to do</p>
<p>a new thing. But who I was at the time, I did not feel confident to do it as how I was.</p>
<p>So a lot of you guys have noticed that I used to wear a snapback in a lot of my videos like</p>
<p>a hat, like a backwards hat. But when I decided I wanted to position myself to work with people</p>
<p>one-on-one, I was like, I need to be taken more serious. I can&rsquo;t be over here looking</p>
<p>like a fuck boy. So me wanting to be taken more serious is why I decided to stop wearing</p>
<p>my hat. Deciding to change that made me feel more confident to do what I decided to do.</p>
<p>Deciding to stop wearing the hat made me feel more confident with transitioning into working</p>
<p>with people one-on-one and becoming a coach. That&rsquo;s something that made me feel better.</p>
<p>It made me feel boosted. It made me feel supported. It made me feel more confident. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a small example of changing something about your physical appearance to better match</p>
<p>and line up with how you want to be portrayed. Because for me to get on here with my snapback,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, cool, it doesn&rsquo;t change what&rsquo;s coming out of my mouth, right? Like I share</p>
<p>good ass shit, but when you have my backwards hat on, it&rsquo;s like in the wife beater and all</p>
<p>my jewelry and shit, bitch, I look like a fuck boy. I look like, what the fuck is he</p>
<p>about to teach me? He&rsquo;s about to talk about getting bitches and shit. No, like it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>negate what&rsquo;s coming out of my mouth because I share really good awareness and I know the</p>
<p>skills that I have and the way that I&rsquo;m able to help people and like completely change</p>
<p>their fucking life. But I needed the package to match the message, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So deciding to change my physical appearance to match that, also getting in way better</p>
<p>shape allowed me to feel more confident to step into working with people one-on-one.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t look at it like I&rsquo;m not wearing my hat because other people don&rsquo;t want me</p>
<p>to. I know people would be fine with me wearing my hat. Y&rsquo;all have been fine with it since</p>
<p>the fucking beginning. But in order for me to feel more confident, I did it for myself.</p>
<p>I did it for the way that I felt to feel more presentable and to feel better about</p>
<p>the package that I&rsquo;m delivering my information from, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So the couple of changes that I made with stepping into becoming a one-on-one coach,</p>
<p>all they were was to help me align with how I wanted to feel to do it. So that&rsquo;s an example</p>
<p>of making changes in support of yourself. But now I want to jump into a couple of questions</p>
<p>that you can ask yourself for a sense of certainty if you want to make a change. Because a lot</p>
<p>of people would be like, no, Leo, you didn&rsquo;t have to stop wearing your hat. That&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>stupid. Oh my God. A lot of people would be like, no, Leo, you don&rsquo;t have to change yourself.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to stop wearing your hat. We accept you. We support you. We love you. Everybody</p>
<p>would be supportive. They wouldn&rsquo;t want me to change myself for what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>But I felt more confident by changing things. So I get that you guys would accept me. And</p>
<p>thank you. I appreciate that a lot. But in order for me to feel more confident doing</p>
<p>what I wanted to do, I made the changes that allowed me to feel that because looking like</p>
<p>a fuck boy on TikTok and looking like a fuck boy in my videos was like not cutting it.</p>
<p>Like I just felt a little bit insecure about trying to be taken seriously when I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look like I take myself seriously, if that makes sense. Okay. So for the questions, my</p>
<p>first one is duh. Why do you want to change something? What&rsquo;s the ultimate goal behind</p>
<p>making a certain change? What&rsquo;s it going to accomplish? So if you want a new body, if</p>
<p>you want more money, if you want a new wardrobe, what are these things going to accomplish</p>
<p>for you? Like what&rsquo;s the true motive and the true goal behind them? If it&rsquo;s in line with</p>
<p>what you want, you know, it&rsquo;s the right decision to make. Do you feel like the new change will</p>
<p>help you feel represented better? Do you feel like the change will represent what you</p>
<p>feel inside and what you want inside? Do you feel like it&rsquo;s going to be an external representation?</p>
<p>Do you feel like it will be more accurate? That&rsquo;s a good way to figure out if you should</p>
<p>change something or not. The next thing is, will it make you feel more comfortable? Like</p>
<p>will changing whatever it is that you want to change, make you feel more comfortable</p>
<p>with who you are and what you want to do. If you realize that you want to change something</p>
<p>so that you can be more accepted, that&rsquo;s a tricky thing to navigate. It&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>acceptance thing. You want people to like you. It&rsquo;s like that is where I&rsquo;d say watch</p>
<p>it. But if you see that making a change will make you feel like a better version of yourself,</p>
<p>make it. That&rsquo;s the change to fucking make. But you have to get very clear on your why.</p>
<p>Why you want to change certain shit girl? Like what, what is the real motive behind</p>
<p>why you want to change it? Is it going to make you feel more comfortable or not? Are</p>
<p>you doing it for acceptance or are you doing it to help you turn into the most ultimate</p>
<p>version of yourself that you want to become? Does it feel like the change you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to make is more you or more of like a facade or a fake representation so people like you?</p>
<p>So the next question is kind of like the thing with my hat. Will making this certain change</p>
<p>make me feel more confident? Whether it&rsquo;s in what I&rsquo;m doing or how I am and who I am</p>
<p>and how I present. Just will it make me more confident? Yes or no? Because if it&rsquo;s yes,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s the decision to make. But also look at that with the why. Why will it make</p>
<p>you feel more confident? Is it the facade thing? Like I feel like people will like this</p>
<p>better so I&rsquo;m more confident in the image that I&rsquo;m putting up or am I going to be more</p>
<p>confident in the actual image of who I am? Okay, so my last question is what made me</p>
<p>shave my fucking head. All right. So is the change you want to make going to make things</p>
<p>more convenient for you? Because girl, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much easier it is not to</p>
<p>shave my fucking head. But shaving my head, let me take you to the decision making process</p>
<p>that I went through, okay? Because I was literally standing in my fucking bathroom with the shaver</p>
<p>in my hand and I was like, should I? But I literally decided within like 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I had thought it through. I&rsquo;m very strategic. I&rsquo;m very calculated. I don&rsquo;t make any rash</p>
<p>decision. But my ability to make decisions has sped up a lot. So when I had the first</p>
<p>thought I was like, should I shave my fucking head? I was looking at the pros and cons.</p>
<p>I had just moved to Houston and I was going to have to start looking for a new barber.</p>
<p>And I was like, I really don&rsquo;t want to try and find a new barber because I&rsquo;m very picky</p>
<p>with who touches my motherfucking head. All right. I&rsquo;m very picky about haircuts because</p>
<p>if you fuck my hair up, you fuck me up. It will ruin you to have a bad haircut. So I</p>
<p>was like kind of having to look for a new barber and I was like shit. And then I was</p>
<p>like trying to save money when I first moved here. I was like tight on money. I was worried</p>
<p>I was concerned. I was like, that&rsquo;s 50 bucks a week that I&rsquo;d be saving if I just shave</p>
<p>my shit. So I also looked at, I&rsquo;m doing one-on-one calls now. So I&rsquo;m going to have to make a</p>
<p>break like during one day for like two hours to go get my fucking haircut. So I was like,</p>
<p>all right, it&rsquo;s going to save me money to shave my own head. It&rsquo;s going to save me time</p>
<p>two hours once a week. Cause I would get my haircut once a week. I&rsquo;m very anal about it.</p>
<p>Like I shave my own shit once a week. And then I also looked at, it will make me look</p>
<p>more clean cut. Cause bitch, my hairline is fucking taken off running. So when I had my</p>
<p>long hair, I was so insecure about my hairline and like the way that it looked in TikToks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big reason why I wore hats all the time. It&rsquo;s cause I don&rsquo;t like to hear</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s little fucking rat mouths. You think I don&rsquo;t see my hairline, bitch. You think</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking see it. You&rsquo;re dumb. You&rsquo;re a fucking bozo. It&rsquo;s like telling me that</p>
<p>my skin is white. No shit girl. I fucking see it. My eyes are Brown. Duh. Like what</p>
<p>the fuck? Yeah. I don&rsquo;t understand when people like point shit out. Like I don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>notice it already. Girl, I&rsquo;m aware that my hairline&rsquo;s fucked up, but what y&rsquo;all aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking aware of and y&rsquo;all little rats run in your fucking mouth is I started losing</p>
<p>my hair at 21 because of what I was going through. A normal person does not start losing</p>
<p>their hair at 21. What I was going through put my body under such an extreme amount of</p>
<p>stress. It started to deteriorate. One of the things was my hair. There was a lot of</p>
<p>things that were fucking up with me. When you are in an extreme level of stress, your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s going to break the fuck down. It cannot withstand it. So what I was going through,</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all have no fucking clue and you would crumble under what the fuck I went through. So you</p>
<p>want to talk shit about my hairline? Go ahead. You couldn&rsquo;t handle what I went through. So</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. I literally don&rsquo;t give a shit about my hairline. Whatever. I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to have full hair, but I&rsquo;m like, really? I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. Who gives a shit? Literally,</p>
<p>who cares? Who actually cares? It&rsquo;s not that big of a fucking deal. I&rsquo;m 24. I got receiving</p>
<p>hair. Whatever, bitch. Who cares? There&rsquo;s worse shit going on in the world. I&rsquo;m six</p>
<p>foot seven. I have muscles. I&rsquo;m kind of cute. I have nice teeth. What the fuck? Who cares</p>
<p>about my hairline? Literally, it&rsquo;s fleece to my worries. But shaving my head solved</p>
<p>the problem a little bit. It made me more confident to just shave my fucking head than</p>
<p>to look like I&rsquo;m trying to hold on to my hair. So that also went into my decision to shave</p>
<p>it. Also, it looks a lot more clean cut. It&rsquo;s very, very fitting. I love it. I feel like</p>
<p>it looks more like me. It has that edge to it that I have to my personality. I feel like</p>
<p>this hair represents me more and feels more accurate than my long fucking hair. I feel</p>
<p>like I just look very immature and messy. Because I would do my hair messy because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to hide my motherfucking forehead. It&rsquo;s big as it is. Then the hairline&rsquo;s receding.</p>
<p>But also waking up in the morning and having to do one-on-one calls, having to do my fucking</p>
<p>hair and make sure it looked okay, it&rsquo;s very inconvenient. Now I can literally wake up</p>
<p>out of fucking bed and my hair looks fine. It looks totally normal. I might have a piece</p>
<p>of lint, but I&rsquo;ll get it out. Then I&rsquo;m ready to go. It&rsquo;s just very convenient for me to</p>
<p>shave my head. You just heard all of the reasons why I shaved my head. So I decided to fucking</p>
<p>do it. Also, it grows back, girl. I&rsquo;ll be just fine. If I hated it, I would have just</p>
<p>grown it back out and been like, whatever. But there was so many upsides to me shaving</p>
<p>my head that I was like, fuck it, we&rsquo;re doing it. I just fucking buzzed it at home. Now</p>
<p>I buzz it every week. That&rsquo;s where I say, ask yourself if the change that you want to</p>
<p>make is going to make things more convenient. It&rsquo;s so much more convenient for me to just</p>
<p>buzz my damn head. To try and go through all the hassle, fuck it. You heard it all. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really okay, bitch. I&rsquo;m not trying to go through all that. I&rsquo;m fucking busy. I have</p>
<p>too much shit to do to be worried about some fucking hair. All right. Okay, now I want</p>
<p>to hit on style for a second because a lot of people are confused about their style and</p>
<p>a lot of y&rsquo;all are like, what the fuck when it comes to mine? Because I only wear black</p>
<p>and y&rsquo;all know that black and gold. I&rsquo;ve tried to change my style so many times. I have dressed</p>
<p>in all black since 12th grade, senior year of high school. Like I was like 17 when I</p>
<p>started wearing black because it just felt more comfortable. It felt more me. It felt</p>
<p>more like, I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it. I just feel like myself when I have my little</p>
<p>black Timberlands on and my black clothes and my gold jewelry. I just feel glee. Okay.</p>
<p>But also my family wears all black. Like all the cars we have are all black. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>black is just our fucking thing. We&rsquo;re Albanian too. So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just fitting. It just</p>
<p>looks good. It just feels the most me, but I know how I&rsquo;ve always wanted to dress. Okay.</p>
<p>I one didn&rsquo;t feel confident in my body a long time ago. Like I would wear t-shirts</p>
<p>instead of like wife beaters, but I knew how I wanted to look and I tried so many times</p>
<p>to wear color. I&rsquo;ve had so many people try and force me to wear color and I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>it and every time I put on anything other than black, I feel uncomfortable. Like it</p>
<p>might look good, but it does not feel right. Like something just feels off. One, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking spill anything. I have to like watch what I do. It&rsquo;s like, girl, fuck that. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too much of a headache. It&rsquo;s convenient to wear black. One, two, it just feels like more</p>
<p>of me. And three, like trying to go change my whole fucking wardrobe to incorporate color.</p>
<p>Like I like when people wear color, I can appreciate it on other people, but black is</p>
<p>just it bitch. It&rsquo;s just me. Like I can&rsquo;t describe it. Like I just feel so off, uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel confident when I&rsquo;m wearing anything other than black. Like it&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>okay. I&rsquo;ll just do my own goddamn thing. But my point of bringing this up as I tried so</p>
<p>many times to dress, to appeal to others. Like I see other people with cute outfits,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d buy colored shit and I never fucking wear it because it just feels weird. And anytime</p>
<p>I would wear it, I just didn&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;ve tried so hard to appeal to other people and</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;m no longer willing to appeal to others by making myself uncomfortable. Like</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t like the way that I dress, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. I feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>I know I look cool. I know I look good. Fuck you. But go ahead with your little fucking</p>
<p>colored shit. I don&rsquo;t mind. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck that you wear color. So you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck that I wear black. Mind your goddamn business. But my whole point is you</p>
<p>know what you feel most confident in. So wear it. Stop trying to look a certain way. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dress like with the trends or I don&rsquo;t buy shit because it&rsquo;s trendy. I buy shit because</p>
<p>I like it and I keep in mind what am I going to feel comfortable in because I&rsquo;ll be fucked</p>
<p>if I spend any more money in this life on some fucking clothes I don&rsquo;t feel confident</p>
<p>in. Like I&rsquo;ve wasted so much money and so much time trying to change my style. Literally</p>
<p>just fucking wear what you know you like. Not because other people like it, but because</p>
<p>it feels like an accurate representation of yourself. What do you feel most confident</p>
<p>in and then wear that. And if it feels more confident to change your style into something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more like representative of what you feel like inside, do it. And don&rsquo;t feel sorry</p>
<p>for it. But that&rsquo;s the whole thing is dress the way that feels accurate to you and makes</p>
<p>you feel confident. Don&rsquo;t dress to what other people like because I don&rsquo;t wear a lot of</p>
<p>shit that normal people wear. I just don&rsquo;t like it. One more thing I want to bring up</p>
<p>about like changing things, especially with style, is there&rsquo;s a difference between something</p>
<p>being uncomfortable because it&rsquo;s something new and something being uncomfortable because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fucking uncomfortable and it feels wrong. So anytime you switch your style you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to feel uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s going to be new. Like you&rsquo;re going to feel confident</p>
<p>in it but it&rsquo;s going to feel a little off because it&rsquo;s different to what you&rsquo;re used</p>
<p>to. So just pay attention to does it feel weird because it&rsquo;s new or does it feel weird</p>
<p>because it feels wrong and it makes you less confident. There&rsquo;s two different feeling states</p>
<p>but pay attention to that. And if you wear something for a certain period of time and</p>
<p>you still feel really uncomfortable it&rsquo;s probably not because it&rsquo;s just new anymore.</p>
<p>So you know what&rsquo;s a good idea to change it to what would make you feel more confident.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s jump into what would Leo do. That&rsquo;s where you guys write in and ask for</p>
<p>advice and I give you what I would do in your situation and I also give you kind of advice</p>
<p>on how to handle it. But these are all going to be about wanting to change yourself. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fitting for the episode but I do want to let you guys know if you want to be featured in</p>
<p>what would Leo do I&rsquo;m going to leave a link in the description of where you can go and</p>
<p>fill out your submission. It&rsquo;s going to be completely anonymous but I was having you</p>
<p>guys DM me on Instagram but the shit&rsquo;s just too overwhelming. I need it all in one place.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to put a link in the description of where you can submit your situation for</p>
<p>what would Leo do. So our first situation is a girl who wants to get plastic surgery.</p>
<p>She wants to get her boobs done. So I love plastic surgery. I&rsquo;m all for like changing</p>
<p>and altering shit but be careful god damn it. But she wants to get her boobs done but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s hesitating and she wants like help kind of like weeding out how to stop hesitating</p>
<p>and how to know if she only wants her boobs done because guys like big boobs or because</p>
<p>she wants big boobs. So what I would do in your situation is ask myself first do I want</p>
<p>bigger boobs? Is getting bigger boobs going to make you feel more confident in your own</p>
<p>body? Like if you sit there and you visualize like having bigger tits like are you going</p>
<p>to feel more confident like yeah. Are you going to feel better about being in your own</p>
<p>body just if no one&rsquo;s around. If no one is around you are you just going to feel more</p>
<p>confident with bigger boobs because that&rsquo;s going to weed out like yeah I&rsquo;ll feel more</p>
<p>confident because guys will look at me. Pretend no one&rsquo;s around. Would you still feel more</p>
<p>confident in your body if your breasts was bigger? I do want to reassure you that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay to have small boobs. It&rsquo;s totally fine to have like normal boobs. I want to make</p>
<p>sure you know that&rsquo;s not weird. Like I want to give you that reassurance but you&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to want to change them. You&rsquo;re allowed to want smaller boobs or bigger boobs. Like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>totally allowed to want either. And like the trends are going to come and go. So like big</p>
<p>boobs in a BBL was like the thing to have in like 2016. Now it&rsquo;s to look like fucking</p>
<p>Bella Hadid with like a tiny waist, a decent ass and like little tits. Like the trends</p>
<p>are going to come and go. So I want you to make a decision based off of what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to make you feel more confident in your own body and not what would make you more appealing</p>
<p>to others. Like having bigger tits is going to make you more appealing to certain men</p>
<p>which is like a plus. But that&rsquo;s not the reason that you get them. Unless they&rsquo;re paying for</p>
<p>them. The next thing I would look at is why you want them. Like is there any personal</p>
<p>reason that you want bigger boobs? That&rsquo;ll help you kind of like make the decision. But</p>
<p>also you can always get them smaller. Like if you get your boobs done and you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>it, you can always reverse it. You can always get smaller boobs. Like I mean you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to go back into surgery which sucks and it&rsquo;s always a risk going under anesthesia.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like a life or death fucking thing. Okay? Like you can get them smaller.</p>
<p>You can get them bigger. Like you can flip it back and forth. But just base your decision</p>
<p>off of what you want and what would make you feel more confident and what would make you</p>
<p>feel more comfortable. But the biggest point I want to make with plastic surgery to anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s considering anything. Plastic surgery is the number one place you do not take a</p>
<p>chance with your fucking body. Do not try and find a fucking deal. Do not try and coupon.</p>
<p>Bitch, cough it up. Pay the fucking money for the good surgeon, for the good doctor,</p>
<p>for the good shit. All right? That&rsquo;s the one thing that I never skimp on is food and plastic</p>
<p>surgery or anything like you&rsquo;re going to alter your body. Do not buy the cheap shit. Do not</p>
<p>try and find no fucking coupon. Suck it up. Save the extra money and go fucking get it</p>
<p>done right. One, so you don&rsquo;t fuck your body up. And two, for your own safety. Because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking horror stories about people getting infections and having shit</p>
<p>fucked up or having boobs be crooked. Like you don&rsquo;t want to fuck anything up with your</p>
<p>body because something might be irreparable. So just remember me saying your body is the</p>
<p>number one place you do not take a fucking chance trying to save money. Now coupon as</p>
<p>much as you want with other shit. Clothes, wanting to get alcohol cheaper like drinking</p>
<p>in the car before you go to the bar. Fine. I do that. But do not skimp when it comes</p>
<p>to plastic surgery. Do your fucking research. Find the good doctors and go to them. Trust</p>
<p>me. It&rsquo;s for your own peace of mind and also increasing your chances of better results</p>
<p>and also your safety. Like it&rsquo;s the biggest thing. So the next person asked, how can I</p>
<p>be more decisive when I&rsquo;m shopping for clothes? You mentioned your style and you&rsquo;re confident</p>
<p>with it and what you wear, even if it&rsquo;s not trendy. How do I find my style? I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to take you through my decision making process for when I&rsquo;m buying shit. Cause I told you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes and I&rsquo;ve wasted a lot of fucking money. But like I said before,</p>
<p>you want to buy shit that makes you feel more confident and that makes you feel more you.</p>
<p>But a couple of the questions that I wrote for like what I go through mentally when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to decide to buy something or not buy it is will it take effort for me to wear it?</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m looking at a certain shirt or like a bag or some shoes, will it take effort</p>
<p>for me to have to style this thing or wear this thing? I&rsquo;m someone that operates kind</p>
<p>of like a uniform. I got wife beaters, I got black tees, I got black jeans, black sweatpants</p>
<p>and black shoes. I do have a pair of white shoes that I&rsquo;ve been wearing recently, but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very easy to style. So look at with something that you&rsquo;re considering buying.</p>
<p>Is it easy to style? Is it something that you already wear? Like will it replace something</p>
<p>that you already use daily? Will it take like a lot of effort for you to fucking like incorporate</p>
<p>it into what you&rsquo;re wearing? Don&rsquo;t buy it because if it takes effort to wear it, you</p>
<p>ain&rsquo;t gonna fucking wear it. It&rsquo;s gonna sit in a goddamn closet. Trust me, I have so much</p>
<p>shit in my closet that I do not fucking wear because it&rsquo;s too hard to style. I need things</p>
<p>I can just throw and go and just know that they&rsquo;re going to look good. That&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>benefit of only wearing black is it fucking matches. I can put on anything in my closet</p>
<p>and it fucking matches. It works. And I&rsquo;m going to give you an example of trying to</p>
<p>replace something that you already wear. Let me go grab these fucking bags because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to tell you the mistake that I made and how you can avoid it. If you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>to the audio version of this and you&rsquo;re not watching it on YouTube, bitch, come to YouTube,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to understand what I&rsquo;m going to try and describe it. So I&rsquo;m holding</p>
<p>up a black bag, a black messenger bag with a golden Medusa head on it. It&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>Versace bag. This fucking bag is my favorite bag. I wear it constantly. I love it to death.</p>
<p>I had an itch to get a new bag for whatever fucking reason. I have a fetish for bags.</p>
<p>I just wanted to buy a new bag. So I was trying to go through my decision making process of</p>
<p>like Leo, what can it replace? Like I wear this nonstop. So I want to get something that</p>
<p>I can grab as easily as I grab this because it goes with fucking everything. It&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s my gun, like it&rsquo;s the perfect fucking bag. So I was like, all right, if I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to buy a bag, it&rsquo;s going to be something that I can use to like alternate this out with</p>
<p>like as effortlessly as I could just grab this and go. I want my other bag to be like</p>
<p>that. Now I&rsquo;m going to show you the bag that I bought and when I show it to you, shut the</p>
<p>fuck up. Don&rsquo;t fucking be mean. For those of you on the audio version, I&rsquo;m holding up</p>
<p>a white Versace bag. It&rsquo;s like the same shape. It&rsquo;s a little bit bigger than the black one,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the same fucking thing as the black one, but it&rsquo;s just white leather instead of</p>
<p>black. Like it&rsquo;s a white messenger bag. Okay. Now the shape, everything fine. If this bag</p>
<p>was black, I would wear it all the fucking time, but I decided I wanted to try something</p>
<p>new and like go out of my style a little bit. I wore this bag one fucking time. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wear this because it&rsquo;s not me. Like don&rsquo;t waste your fucking time trying to be different</p>
<p>because what do I use now, bitch? This still, I don&rsquo;t fucking use this. I&rsquo;m going to list</p>
<p>this for sale soon. Like it&rsquo;s literally like basically brand fucking. I used it one time.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t set it down nowhere. Like it was just on my body. This is the prime example</p>
<p>of how you can still fuck up and don&rsquo;t do it. Like just listen to me. Trust me. If you</p>
<p>know you have something that you like, just fucking stick with it. Unless you have something</p>
<p>that is like you love it and you can&rsquo;t leave the fucking store without it. Do not buy it</p>
<p>because like I said, this is something like that. I thought I could alternate with that,</p>
<p>but when the fuck do I wear white? This was a lapse in judgment for me. Okay. And like</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;ve worn it once, so it was a fucking like waste. Like it did teach me how to be</p>
<p>more decisive and like solidify that I need to be fucking picky with like what I wear</p>
<p>and like what I know I won&rsquo;t wear. But like in the moment I was so excited about this.</p>
<p>I loved it so much, but then I&rsquo;m like trying to style it and it&rsquo;s taking a lot of effort</p>
<p>to style it. And when I put on an outfit, when I put on the black one, it just feels</p>
<p>more me. It just like fits. It looks better. Like, but when I put this on, I have not found</p>
<p>an outfit where this looks better than the black one. So it just pisses me the fuck off</p>
<p>that I even bought it. I&rsquo;m upset about it and I&rsquo;m going to fucking sell it. All right.</p>
<p>But just learn from me and my mistake and buy shit that&rsquo;s easy for you to style something</p>
<p>that already goes into your wardrobe. Now, if I wore a lot of white, I&rsquo;m sure it would</p>
<p>be cute. I don&rsquo;t wear white. My desk is white and that&rsquo;s it. So our next situation is someone</p>
<p>wrote in and asked, basically they put like a long description, but I&rsquo;m just going to</p>
<p>sum it up. They basically asked, how do I get people to think that I&rsquo;m cool? And I kind</p>
<p>of went through this. Like I told you guys, I&rsquo;ve changed everything about myself as many</p>
<p>times as you could fucking think of to get people to like me. But if you want to look</p>
<p>more cool, what I would do is switch my focus from trying to look cool and put my effort</p>
<p>into trying to be cool. Like don&rsquo;t waste your time trying to look cool because you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to feel imposter syndrome. You&rsquo;re going to feel like a fucking wacko. You&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>like fake and people will be able to feel it. People can tell when you&rsquo;re trying and</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like faking it. But don&rsquo;t try to look cool. Try to be cool. And the way</p>
<p>that you can be cool is by doing cool shit. Like do interesting things. Spend time doing</p>
<p>interesting things. Do fun things. Do fun shit. And the biggest thing with being cool</p>
<p>is don&rsquo;t go with the flow just because it&rsquo;s what everybody else does. Don&rsquo;t do shit that</p>
<p>everybody else is doing. Do things that you want to do. If it happens to be things that</p>
<p>other people do, do it. But don&rsquo;t only do things just because other people do them.</p>
<p>Check in with yourself with what you like and what you want to do and then do that also.</p>
<p>Because this is what will draw people to you. It will make them want to be around you. Spend</p>
<p>time with you. They&rsquo;ll look at you like, oh my god, they&rsquo;re the coolest fucking person</p>
<p>ever. They&rsquo;re doing all this shit. People don&rsquo;t have the balls usually to go outside</p>
<p>the box and do what they want to do. So for you to go do what you want to do and be confident</p>
<p>in it and fucking do it because you enjoy it, people are going to be envious and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to like it and it&rsquo;s going to make you seem a lot more cool because you are going</p>
<p>to be cool. You&rsquo;re doing what you fucking like even if other people think it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>weird. But doing what everybody else does is like not cool. The only people who are</p>
<p>going to think that you&rsquo;re cool if you&rsquo;re doing normal shit is other people who do normal</p>
<p>shit. Like actual cool people don&rsquo;t think that normal Joe Schmo ass people are cool.</p>
<p>The only people that are going to think you&rsquo;re cool if you do Joe Schmo shit are Joe Schmos.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not actually being cool. That&rsquo;s looking cool to people but it&rsquo;s not actually</p>
<p>being cool. Is this making sense? And the other way I kind of look at this is like if</p>
<p>I think something is lame, I&rsquo;m not going to do it. But I don&rsquo;t look at things like oh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people think is lame so I&rsquo;m not going to do it. I don&rsquo;t not do things that</p>
<p>I want to do because other people will think that they&rsquo;re lame. If I want to do something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll fucking do it. Like I roller skate. Like I grew up roller skating like with little</p>
<p>quads like little like what&rsquo;s the skates with the four? That&rsquo;s quads. Like the four wheels.</p>
<p>Like one, two, three, four. And like you just like skate around. I grew up skating</p>
<p>and I fucking always loved it. But I thought it was weird for like my big ass to go around</p>
<p>skating and then I met a friend who also likes to skate. So like me and her used to go skate</p>
<p>around town and shit. And it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just so much fun. It&rsquo;s a little exercise. Fine.</p>
<p>Good time. Put on a little music. But other people would look at that and be like oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking lame. But I don&rsquo;t give a shit. Like I think it&rsquo;s fun. I like it so I do it. But</p>
<p>if you think skating is lame or you&rsquo;re just not interested in it then don&rsquo;t do it. But</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do things just because you&rsquo;re scared they might look lame to other people. Do it</p>
<p>regardless if you want to do it. Like I want to go to a trampoline park so bad. Like the</p>
<p>indoor like buildings with like all the trampolines. It&rsquo;s like for kids and shit. But I love shit</p>
<p>like that. Like I want to go play on a fucking trampoline so bad. Like I&rsquo;m trying to like</p>
<p>yell at my friends like hey can we go? Like I&rsquo;m not going to go alone. Like I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to make them go with me. Because I&rsquo;m going to eat them up with the flips and shit. Because</p>
<p>I can do flips. The fuck? So like I&rsquo;m so excited to go do that. But other people would look</p>
<p>at that and be like that&rsquo;s fucking lame. And I look at it like no it&rsquo;s fun. Like I</p>
<p>get why it would be perceived as lame. It&rsquo;s a little weird. But I want to fucking do it.</p>
<p>And the biggest thing with looking cool and like being cool is doing shit regardless of</p>
<p>what other people think. Like having a different opinion is cool. Having something that you</p>
<p>like and then doing it regardless is cool as fuck. People wish that they could do that.</p>
<p>People are so driven by society and being accepted and all that shit. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to look at you like you&rsquo;re over here fucking skating you fucking loser. But like</p>
<p>inside they&rsquo;re going to be like ugh I wish I had the balls to like go do something I</p>
<p>wanted to do. You see? Also if there&rsquo;s a conversation going on or you&rsquo;re in a conversation and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lame as fuck or you&rsquo;re bored. Like walk away. Like just literally leave it. And I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying like if it&rsquo;s a one on one conversation. Like switch the conversation to something</p>
<p>more like enjoyable. But if you&rsquo;re in a conversation with multiple people and it&rsquo;s boring. Fucking</p>
<p>walk out of it. Like walk away from it. Don&rsquo;t just sit there and like be bored as shit in</p>
<p>a conversation just to look like you&rsquo;re in conversation. Like go find something more</p>
<p>important to do. Go have fun. What the hell? Like if I&rsquo;m at a party or something and people</p>
<p>are boring I&rsquo;ll walk away. Like I&rsquo;m going to go find some fun. I&rsquo;ll go be the fun if</p>
<p>I have to go be the fun. But I don&rsquo;t play around with like lame shit. Like if I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>a conversation and I&rsquo;m like bored I&rsquo;m not going to hang out in it. And like if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a one on one thing I&rsquo;m just going to like change the topic. Like very sly and very like</p>
<p>slick to be something that I actually like to talk about or like am interested by. And</p>
<p>this will give you the allure of like you care about your time and people will respect</p>
<p>that. It&rsquo;s like when you go to a party or an after party or some shit and you know when</p>
<p>to call it a fucking night or like you go out and it gets like boring. You know when</p>
<p>to call it a fucking night and leave. People are going to know you don&rsquo;t like doing shit</p>
<p>just for the like fact of doing it. Like you have to be stimulated. You have to have fun.</p>
<p>It has to be enjoyable or you&rsquo;re not doing it. That is cool. That&rsquo;s cool as fuck. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people who know when to call it a night because they hate going out with people who are like</p>
<p>partying in someone&rsquo;s kitchen at like 5am. No I don&rsquo;t do that no more. When I was going</p>
<p>the fuck through it that was me. No more bitch. If it&rsquo;s not fun I&rsquo;m leaving. If it&rsquo;s boring</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not there. I&rsquo;m going to go be the fun. But the biggest thing with that is like people</p>
<p>are going to respect you and respect your time because they know you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>hang out in something that&rsquo;s not like fun for you that you don&rsquo;t like. That is going</p>
<p>to make people think you&rsquo;re cool as fuck and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s actually going to make you</p>
<p>cool. If you like this podcast episode leave this video a thumbs up. Leave me a comment</p>
