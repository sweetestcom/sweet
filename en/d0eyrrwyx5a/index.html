to talk about the seventh reason for weight loss plateau all right so you&amp;rsquo;re doing keto you think you&amp;rsquo;re doing it correctly but it&amp;rsquo;s maybe not working how do we make it work better i&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of videos on this but number one the most important thing is to make sure your carbs are low and i&amp;rsquo;m talking below about 10 grams per day not per meal but per day so whatever your carbs are bring them on the low side very important all right number two you may not be fasting long enough so if you&amp;rsquo;re on two meals a day you might need to go to one meal a day if you&amp;rsquo;re on one meal a day you may want to consider doing a longer fast so potentially you need to eat once every other day but for some people with a very slow metabolism that&amp;rsquo;s what they need to do also the question they ask is this when you eat are you really hungry because if you&amp;rsquo;re not hungry keep fasting until you are hungry and i&amp;rsquo;ve had people go you know several days of fasting because they just weren&amp;rsquo;t hungry and that&amp;rsquo;s totally fine just make sure you take your electrolytes and your b vitamins if you&amp;rsquo;re fasting all right so lowering carbs and decreasing the frequency of your meals will get you into ketosis and it will help reduce inflammation if you have a lot of inflammation in your body that&amp;rsquo;s going to kill ketosis right off the bat all right number three it could be that your stress is just too high this is going to activate cortisol and cortisol will totally bump you out of fat burning so do whatever you can to lower your stress go for long walks i have a lot of videos on this i will put some down below all right next point is your sleep cycles if you have poor sleep you got to fix that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of reasons why people don&amp;rsquo;t sleep big one is stress so after you improve your stress that should help sleep if you can get an extra hour of sleep that believe it or not will help you lose weight you burn the most fat when you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping and you have the most growth hormone when you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping growth hormone is the main fat burning hormone all right next one is exercise let&amp;rsquo;s say you don&amp;rsquo;t exercise well start exercising just make sure that you recover from your exercise some people don&amp;rsquo;t have the recovery they over exercise to over train and that will slow down your weight loss but if your sleep is good and you&amp;rsquo;re not over training it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect combination because then you&amp;rsquo;re going to recover from the exercise all right number six you&amp;rsquo;re eating too much fat or too much protein now there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with eating too much fat as long as your carbs are low but if you have a slow metabolism and you&amp;rsquo;re adding extra fat to like mct oil butter keto cookie bombs things like that your body is going to go after that dietary fat before your own fat so you may want to consider bringing it down to right around 75 grams you don&amp;rsquo;t want to bring it down too low but bring it down a little bit that may help you and make sure your protein is a moderate amount not a high amount because the extra protein will definitely turn into glucose and raise the insulin all right number seven the seventh reason why you may be plateauing you have a deficiency of your microbes okay you have a microbiome deficiency you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough friendly bacteria now what does this bacteria have to do with weight loss there&amp;rsquo;s some very interesting studies one study i&amp;rsquo;m going to put all these studies down below show that when you consume regular probiotics you will see significantly more weight loss and you&amp;rsquo;ll see an improved ldl especially the bad ldl it&amp;rsquo;s called the small dense particle size that actually improves when you take probiotics all right in another study double-blind randomized control trial showed that there was improved insulin sensitivity okay because you&amp;rsquo;re improving insulin resistance and as you may know insulin resistance is behind a slow metabolism so when you add the microbes your gut you actually indirectly improve your insulin resistance you make insulin more sensitive so the body does not have to produce as much insulin it also helps regulate your blood sugars and then in the third study there&amp;rsquo;s an improved test called homa ir which is a test to indicate if you have insulin resistance again so what&amp;rsquo;s happening the microbiomes eat fiber that then turns into a compound that greatly improves in sun resistance in your blood sugar so you&amp;rsquo;re indirectly helping yourself lose weight by letting the microbes do the work if you have enough diversity in your gut you&amp;rsquo;re going to be way better at losing weight than if you don&amp;rsquo;t and also this is another interesting point when farmers use antibiotics they can actually fatten their animals so antibiotics make animals get fatter well if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the microbes in your gut whether you took an antibiotic or not that could be one reason why it&amp;rsquo;s contributing to your weight gain and if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough microbes in your gut a lot of times you&amp;rsquo;ll have inflammatory problems in your gut that inflammation will totally kill ketosis so again low carb fast longer vitamin d and then fortify with probiotics and then the next point like i said insulin resistance is greatly improved when you fortify your gut with probiotics because the microbes eat the fiber which then turns into something that helps your blood sugars and just so you know good probiotics can actually help build up your friendly bacteria but fiber okay it&amp;rsquo;s a prebiotic doesn&amp;rsquo;t make new microbes it actually just feeds the microbes you have the food that your microbes like to eat is fiber and i&amp;rsquo;m talking about from non-starchy vegetables i&amp;rsquo;m not talking about doing the whole grains and the cool thing about fiber it is the only carbohydrate that has zero influence on insulin so it&amp;rsquo;s good hey before you go if you&amp;rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success

weight loss plateau all right so you&rsquo;re doing  </p><p>keto you think you&rsquo;re doing it correctly but it&rsquo;s 
maybe not working how do we make it work better  </p><p>i&rsquo;ve done a lot of videos on this but number 
one the most important thing is to make sure  </p><p>your carbs are low and i&rsquo;m talking below about 10 
grams per day not per meal but per day so whatever  </p><p>your carbs are bring them on the low side very 
important all right number two you may not be  </p><p>fasting long enough so if you&rsquo;re on two meals 
a day you might need to go to one meal a day if  </p><p>you&rsquo;re on one meal a day you may want to consider 
doing a longer fast so potentially you need to eat  </p><p>once every other day but for some people with 
a very slow metabolism that&rsquo;s what they need to  </p><p>do also the question they ask is this when you eat 
are you really hungry because if you&rsquo;re not hungry  </p><p>keep fasting until you are hungry and i&rsquo;ve had 
people go you know several days of fasting because  </p><p>they just weren&rsquo;t hungry and that&rsquo;s totally fine 
just make sure you take your electrolytes and your  </p><p>b vitamins if you&rsquo;re fasting all right so lowering 
carbs and decreasing the frequency of your meals  </p><p>will get you into ketosis and it will help 
reduce inflammation if you have a lot of  </p><p>inflammation in your body that&rsquo;s going to kill 
ketosis right off the bat all right number three  </p><p>it could be that your stress is just too high this 
is going to activate cortisol and cortisol will  </p><p>totally bump you out of fat burning so do whatever 
you can to lower your stress go for long walks i  </p><p>have a lot of videos on this i will put some down 
below all right next point is your sleep cycles if  </p><p>you have poor sleep you got to fix that there&rsquo;s a 
lot of reasons why people don&rsquo;t sleep big one is  </p><p>stress so after you improve your stress that 
should help sleep if you can get an extra hour  </p><p>of sleep that believe it or not will help you lose 
weight you burn the most fat when you&rsquo;re sleeping  </p><p>and you have the most growth hormone when you&rsquo;re 
sleeping growth hormone is the main fat burning  </p><p>hormone all right next one is exercise let&rsquo;s say 
you don&rsquo;t exercise well start exercising just  </p><p>make sure that you recover from your exercise some 
people don&rsquo;t have the recovery they over exercise  </p><p>to over train and that will slow down your weight 
loss but if your sleep is good and you&rsquo;re not over  </p><p>training it&rsquo;s a perfect combination because then 
you&rsquo;re going to recover from the exercise all  </p><p>right number six you&rsquo;re eating too much fat or too 
much protein now there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with eating  </p><p>too much fat as long as your carbs are low but if 
you have a slow metabolism and you&rsquo;re adding extra  </p><p>fat to like mct oil butter keto cookie bombs 
things like that your body is going to go after  </p><p>that dietary fat before your own fat so you may 
want to consider bringing it down to right around  </p><p>75 grams you don&rsquo;t want to bring it down too low 
but bring it down a little bit that may help you  </p><p>and make sure your protein is a moderate amount 
not a high amount because the extra protein will  </p><p>definitely turn into glucose and raise the insulin 
all right number seven the seventh reason why you  </p><p>may be plateauing you have a deficiency of your 
microbes okay you have a microbiome deficiency  </p><p>you don&rsquo;t have enough friendly bacteria now what 
does this bacteria have to do with weight loss  </p><p>there&rsquo;s some very interesting studies one study 
i&rsquo;m going to put all these studies down below  </p><p>show that when you consume regular probiotics 
you will see significantly more weight loss  </p><p>and you&rsquo;ll see an improved ldl especially the 
bad ldl it&rsquo;s called the small dense particle size  </p><p>that actually improves when you take probiotics 
all right in another study double-blind  </p><p>randomized control trial showed that 
there was improved insulin sensitivity  </p><p>okay because you&rsquo;re improving insulin resistance 
and as you may know insulin resistance is behind a  </p><p>slow metabolism so when you add the microbes your 
gut you actually indirectly improve your insulin  </p><p>resistance you make insulin more sensitive so 
the body does not have to produce as much insulin  </p><p>it also helps regulate your blood sugars and 
then in the third study there&rsquo;s an improved test  </p><p>called homa ir which is a test to indicate if you 
have insulin resistance again so what&rsquo;s happening  </p><p>the microbiomes eat fiber that then turns into a 
compound that greatly improves in sun resistance  </p><p>in your blood sugar so you&rsquo;re indirectly helping 
yourself lose weight by letting the microbes  </p><p>do the work if you have enough diversity in your 
gut you&rsquo;re going to be way better at losing weight  </p><p>than if you don&rsquo;t and also this is another 
interesting point when farmers use antibiotics  </p><p>they can actually fatten their animals so 
antibiotics make animals get fatter well  </p><p>if you don&rsquo;t have the microbes in your 
gut whether you took an antibiotic or not  </p><p>that could be one reason why it&rsquo;s contributing 
to your weight gain and if you don&rsquo;t have enough  </p><p>microbes in your gut a lot of times you&rsquo;ll 
have inflammatory problems in your gut  </p><p>that inflammation will totally kill ketosis so 
again low carb fast longer vitamin d and then  </p><p>fortify with probiotics and then the next point 
like i said insulin resistance is greatly improved  </p><p>when you fortify your gut with probiotics because 
the microbes eat the fiber which then turns into  </p><p>something that helps your blood sugars and just 
so you know good probiotics can actually help  </p><p>build up your friendly bacteria but fiber okay 
it&rsquo;s a prebiotic doesn&rsquo;t make new microbes it  </p><p>actually just feeds the microbes you have the food 
that your microbes like to eat is fiber and i&rsquo;m  </p><p>talking about from non-starchy vegetables i&rsquo;m not 
talking about doing the whole grains and the cool  </p><p>thing about fiber it is the only carbohydrate 
that has zero influence on insulin so it&rsquo;s good  </p><p>hey before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting 
from any of my content i would love  </p><p>to hear about your success story
