    <p>Today&rsquo;s show is sponsored by audible. Go to audible.com slash</p>
<p>Carlin that&rsquo;s audible.com slash Carlin or text Carlin to 500500</p>
<p>to get started.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just heard the audio that you&rsquo;re about to hear and this is</p>
<p>my own critique of the audio that you&rsquo;re about to hear and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little redundant only because I actually start off the</p>
<p>program with a little bit of that sort of talk too. So I</p>
<p>apologize for the redundancy. But I&rsquo;m going to call this</p>
<p>episode. I&rsquo;m going to throw a nightmare somehow, because it</p>
<p>sounds like a nightmare. And I don&rsquo;t just mean because of the</p>
<p>material, which is nightmarish. Nothing new about that, of</p>
<p>course, on, you know, what we do. But almost my recounting of</p>
<p>it is like that, like you woke up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>you know, screaming, and the next morning, your spouse says</p>
<p>to you, what the heck was that all about? And you try to</p>
<p>recount, you know, what happened to you in your</p>
<p>nightmare. And it always sounds like a bunch of disjointed,</p>
<p>flashing images. You know, we always like to try to put a</p>
<p>little artistic touch or a little flair here or there with</p>
<p>the big hardcore history shows. And I feel like that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing in the audio that you&rsquo;re going to hear now. It sounds</p>
<p>like a nightmare. It sounds like I&rsquo;m just telling you the</p>
<p>highlights or worst moments or the things that freaked me out</p>
<p>the most or whatever is sticking in my memory after going back to</p>
<p>sleep in the middle of the night. But for some of you,</p>
<p>especially I think, you know, those of you who already know</p>
<p>some of this or all of this story, it will remind you once</p>
<p>again, that, you know, if I&rsquo;m recounting a nightmarish sort of</p>
<p>story to you, I mean, think about how many people actually</p>
<p>woke up in the night for many, many, many decades after this</p>
<p>event with this exact same nightmare. And it&rsquo;s pretty safe</p>
<p>to say that unlike me who wasn&rsquo;t there, the people who were there</p>
<p>would probably be unable to tell anyone else who wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there, you know, what they were seeing in their dreams. So</p>
<p>apologies for the lack of artistic flair and what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hear now. But, um, you know, welcome to a nightmare of</p>
<p>the Indianapolis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hardcore history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to think about what the difference between one of</p>
<p>these hardcore history addendums, and one of the larger</p>
<p>hardcore history shows is I mean, what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between the two of them? Besides, obviously, that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing some interviews. But I thought, you know, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole bunch of great stories out there. And I write them down,</p>
<p>you know, whenever I think of one, I put it in a book so that,</p>
<p>you know, someday when I don&rsquo;t have enough ideas, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch already down. I know a lot of you do this too. And a bunch</p>
<p>of these ideas are not worth a whole history show or you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do a whole history show. I mean, I&rsquo;d love to do something</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve wanted to do something for a long time on the ancient</p>
<p>Egyptian neighbor, known as Cush, the Cushites, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no primary source material. I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>where you just can&rsquo;t hang a whole show on what you have to</p>
<p>work with. There&rsquo;s a lot of stories like that. The one today</p>
<p>is like that. I mean, there is actually enough material to do a</p>
<p>whole big four hour thing on this subject. But it would get</p>
<p>repetitive and it would get repetitive in a way that makes</p>
<p>the first world war program we did, which was pretty repetitive</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, ongoing horror. It would make that seem</p>
<p>a little tame because at a certain point in this story,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing but that. And it&rsquo;s psychological torture after</p>
<p>a certain amount of time. And so it&rsquo;s hard to not get gratuitous</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s hard to not just get redundant at a certain point.</p>
<p>You want to be able to say to the audience, and there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>more of that and you know what that&rsquo;s like. I thought about</p>
<p>talking about this because I caught really the tail end the</p>
<p>other night of a movie that&rsquo;s underrated. Although when I went</p>
<p>online to do some more modern research on it, I was surprised</p>
<p>to find that it is considered kind of an artistic classic. Now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s really early movies. It&rsquo;s Jaws.</p>
<p>I think it came out in like 1975. I was 10. And I can tell</p>
<p>you that it was a huge event and sort of an unexpected one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d been a novel that had done pretty well, but the novel</p>
<p>was very different than the movie. And the movie, as all I</p>
<p>think really great films do, has a number of really fine actors</p>
<p>in it. And you give those people a really fine script. And I</p>
<p>guess there was a significant amount of improvisation from</p>
<p>time to time that made it into the final version that the</p>
<p>actors did. But you remember who was in that? I mean, Roy</p>
<p>Scheider, who was great. You had Richard Dreyfus, who was still</p>
<p>great. And my God, you had Robert Shaw, who was</p>
<p>unbelievable. And in that role, I mean, among others. And you</p>
<p>get the three of them at certain points in the story, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just in the cabin. I mean, there&rsquo;s no scenery, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>movement really of the cameras. It&rsquo;s just those three actors</p>
<p>work in a fine script. And at one point, Robert Shaw goes into</p>
<p>a monologue. And it&rsquo;s incredible, from a from a</p>
<p>appreciating the craft standpoint. Those of you who</p>
<p>remember, though, the monologue, it has to do with the character</p>
<p>that Robert Shaw is playing in his past. He&rsquo;s playing sort of</p>
<p>an old sea dog kind of fisherman who&rsquo;s going to catch this shark</p>
<p>and he knows a lot about sharks. And he goes into the background</p>
<p>and it turns out he was on the USS Indianapolis. And those of</p>
<p>you who know that story know how that&rsquo;s connected to sharks. And</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m watching this, the tail end, like I said, of Jaws the</p>
<p>other night, I just thought, you know, the Indianapolis is an</p>
<p>amazing story. And it typifies where sort of some of my</p>
<p>interests tend to lean, as you all know, I always like to say,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a nice way of saying it, that I&rsquo;m into the extremes</p>
<p>of the human experience. But some people think I&rsquo;m just into</p>
<p>war and this and violence. And, you know, it&rsquo;s funny, sometimes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read accounts from like 100 years ago, there&rsquo;s a famous</p>
<p>one from a German general named Von Moltke, where he talks about</p>
<p>sort of the reasons you wouldn&rsquo;t want to go too long between wars</p>
<p>because it brings out something in the human character. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not talking about the low level side, you know, the killing of</p>
<p>your fellow man in butchery, he&rsquo;s talking about sort of the</p>
<p>higher side of the human experience. And it&rsquo;s weird to</p>
<p>think about that. See, I don&rsquo;t agree with him about that. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going there. But the story of the Indianapolis is a perfect</p>
<p>example of something where it only happens because of war. But</p>
<p>what happens after the sinking of the ship, the famous sinking</p>
<p>of the ship is one of these tales where I mean, you just it</p>
<p>sends tears down your face, and not just because of the human</p>
<p>suffering, but because of the human reaction to the suffering,</p>
<p>right, that it was kind of those higher qualities that Von Moltke</p>
<p>was sort of referring to when you see people under amazing</p>
<p>amounts of physical and psychological pressure with</p>
<p>fellow human beings and how they act in situations that are far</p>
<p>more stressful than what one could be expected to reasonably</p>
<p>handle. The Indianapolis combines a number of things</p>
<p>which would make my top 10 list of worst nightmares, wrap them</p>
<p>all into one wonderful package. If you are a fan of disaster</p>
<p>movies, not to compare this to a disaster movie, no offense,</p>
<p>um, family members of Indianapolis survivors, or not</p>
<p>survivors. But I mean, think you&rsquo;re my my mom was in a movie</p>
<p>once that was a knock knock off of the towering inferno. So</p>
<p>build burning building, that&rsquo;s a disaster movie, you hang a whole</p>
<p>movie on that. And you have something like the Poseidon</p>
<p>adventure or Titanic, which is a disaster movie of a ship</p>
<p>sinking at sea hang a whole movie on that. There are I mean,</p>
<p>each each segment and phase in the Indianapolis story is one of</p>
<p>those disaster films. And by the time the the story is over,</p>
<p>and is the story ever really over? Um, you know, these</p>
<p>people, it&rsquo;s like these people went from the towering inferno</p>
<p>hopped on board the Titanic. I mean, just one thing after</p>
<p>another. And I don&rsquo;t mean to make light of it. Because when</p>
<p>you read the accounts of what these people went through, and</p>
<p>then you sort of magnify it because what they went through</p>
<p>is not that uncommon in human history. They&rsquo;re not like these</p>
<p>real outliers. It&rsquo;s uncommon for you and me to have gone</p>
<p>through it. But how many mariners over the waves over the</p>
<p>eras have had their ship sink and gone through the terrible</p>
<p>things that that involves, and then had to deal with some of</p>
<p>the subsidiary things that all of the people who went in the</p>
<p>water with the Indianapolis had to deal with. So in a funny way,</p>
<p>this is a kind of common, uncommon human experience, if</p>
<p>you will. But the Indianapolis a story is, there&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got its own twists. In this case, if you don&rsquo;t know it, let</p>
<p>me fill you in for a minute. And I don&rsquo;t know how well this is</p>
<p>going to work in short form, because you know, that&rsquo;s not my</p>
<p>normal genre. But the Indianapolis is famously known</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a USS Portland class cruiser, heavy cruiser, heavy</p>
<p>cruisers, generally mean, you know, bigger, more armor, bigger</p>
<p>guns. So in the United States Navy in the Second World War, if</p>
<p>it had six inch guns, it was probably a light cruiser. If it</p>
<p>had eight inch guns, it was probably a heavy cruiser, about</p>
<p>10,000 tons big ship, between 600 and 700 feet long. And in</p>
<p>this case, the Indianapolis is famous because it delivered some</p>
<p>of the key components, you know, to an island in the Pacific that</p>
<p>would be put together and made into the first atomic bomb. But</p>
<p>because of that, it was a secret mission and people weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really in the know about the comings and the goings of the</p>
<p>Indianapolis, perhaps as well as they should have been aware</p>
<p>of it. And this kind of plays into the story in a pretty big</p>
<p>way. Because after delivering the components to the island of</p>
<p>Tinian, this Indianapolis Portland class heavy cruiser</p>
<p>goes off on its merry way kind of towards the Philippines, I</p>
<p>think it was. And in the night, gets torpedoed by a Japanese</p>
<p>submarine. Now this is in 1945. I think it&rsquo;s July. So it&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, we are not that far from the end of the war at all. I</p>
<p>mean, as we said, they&rsquo;re kind of putting the parts together</p>
<p>for the Hiroshima bomb. So not that far away from the end of</p>
<p>the war. But now you get to the first level of this disaster</p>
<p>that these Indianapolis folks have to deal with. Imagine being</p>
<p>asleep in your bunk at night on a ship and two torpedoes slam</p>
<p>into it one slammed into the bow at the front of the ship one</p>
<p>slam sort of a midships but a little forward survivors</p>
<p>accounts. And by the way, you want to read a good book on</p>
<p>this. Let me just break into this for a minute. I really</p>
<p>loved in harm&rsquo;s way by Doug Stanton, although there are</p>
<p>several books on the Indianapolis, I&rsquo;m going to quote</p>
<p>a couple of pieces from Stanton&rsquo;s book. But if you think</p>
<p>this story is interesting, and you want to get the real feel</p>
<p>for it, he does a great job, I think. But Stanton talks about,</p>
<p>you know, when the two torpedoes hit, he&rsquo;s talking to a survivor</p>
<p>that was sort of in the front of the ship. And he was a</p>
<p>sleep in his bunk in one of these, you know, sort of ship</p>
<p>rooms that they have that you probably have 6, 8, 10 guys, and</p>
<p>the bunks are stacked against the wall. And when the torpedoes</p>
<p>hit, the survivor says the lights go out, and all the bunks</p>
<p>fall, and everybody&rsquo;s in a pile of people, and some have broken</p>
<p>arms and ribs, and everybody, of course, woken up from a deep</p>
<p>sleep, you&rsquo;re totally confused. And with the lights out, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, extra bad. So immediately, this ship starts</p>
<p>having problems. And so the crew starts doing the typical things</p>
<p>you do to try to, you know, prevent the ship from sinking.</p>
<p>And one of the things you do is you start walling off the</p>
<p>compartments that are damaged and flooding. Dogging things</p>
<p>down is the way Stanton has the Navy guys describing it in the</p>
<p>book. But the problem with that is if you&rsquo;re cutting off</p>
<p>compartments that are flooding, what do you do with the people</p>
<p>that are still in the flooding compartments, right? So the</p>
<p>first thing that just horrifies you in this story of the</p>
<p>Indianapolis going down at night, in the tropical waters,</p>
<p>sort of east of the Philippines, is that you have these sailors</p>
<p>who have to cut their own shipmates off in flooding</p>
<p>compartments. And Stanton says, you can hear him scream, you</p>
<p>know, don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t leave us here. I mean, what do you but what are</p>
<p>you supposed to do? So right there, you get you want to talk</p>
<p>human experiences that are extreme and that are already</p>
<p>larger than most of us will ever face. In the first five minutes</p>
<p>of this disaster, there are guys dealing with things that are</p>
<p>going to haunt their memories the rest of their lives. And the</p>
<p>and the affair is hardly started. You know, when you talk</p>
<p>about the human capacity for endurance, survival, and not</p>
<p>just survival through the event, but then to be able to live with</p>
<p>it, you know, afterwards. And by the way, the guy who was the</p>
<p>captain of the Indianapolis made it about 20 years. Afterwards,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll survive the whole thing, but he&rsquo;ll kill himself. Still</p>
<p>getting Christmas cards from people who say and I&rsquo;m quoting</p>
<p>one here. Merry Christmas, our family&rsquo;s holiday would be a lot</p>
<p>merrier if you hadn&rsquo;t killed my son. Stanton says that the</p>
<p>captain, a guy named McVeigh, would keep all of these letters</p>
<p>and put them, you know, with a ribbon around them and keep them</p>
<p>in his desk, blaming himself always for what happened on that</p>
<p>dark night. But on this ship, these people that survive will</p>
<p>talk about seeing him, you know, running around this sinking ship</p>
<p>as it starts to take on water. And by the way, they have 12</p>
<p>minutes between the time the torpedoes strike till the time</p>
<p>it goes down. And once again, the idea of having a between 600</p>
<p>and 700 foot long 10,000 ton ship begin to disintegrate out</p>
<p>from under you and go underwater as the waves begin rolling</p>
<p>people off the deck is crazy. Also, so now, right away, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like the second stage. So you had to cut your semen off and dog</p>
<p>down into the compartments and consign them to certain death.</p>
<p>So the rest of the ship might survive. Now you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>the mental image of the ship starting to go down by the bow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the front and the stern starts to slowly rise out of</p>
<p>the I mean, the ship is going perpendicular, and people are</p>
<p>dropping off and Stanton described survivors saying people will</p>
<p>jump off and hit the rudders, people will jump off and hit the</p>
<p>propellers that are still spinning and be launched off into</p>
<p>space. Once again, how do you even in 12 minutes or less,</p>
<p>really process all this. And it&rsquo;s dark, and people are</p>
<p>freaking out. I mean, this is like a giant accident scene</p>
<p>right away. There&rsquo;s like between 11 and 1200 guys on this ship.</p>
<p>And more than 300 are going to die in the first 12 minutes. And</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re watching all this happening. And many of these</p>
<p>people now are grievously wounded. Stanton, one of the</p>
<p>main survivors he talks about in this thing, I mean, the first</p>
<p>thing he hears when he recovers from hearing the torpedo hits is</p>
<p>somebody screaming in the compartment next door, and he</p>
<p>runs over there realizes it&rsquo;s his friend, the dentist, but he</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t open the door because the whole thing&rsquo;s on fire. And he</p>
<p>just has to let him burn to death in the first two minutes.</p>
<p>And then he burns his hand because the ship itself is</p>
<p>turning red hot. He puts his hands on the deck or on a rail</p>
<p>boom, he&rsquo;s got burned hands. And then as the ship starts to go</p>
<p>kind of perpendicular. He tells the story about they have a</p>
<p>bunch of wounded people, I guess in the sickbay, but they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>cots, and they&rsquo;re tied to their beds and whatnot. And he says</p>
<p>they just all slide right into the sea. And he&rsquo;s sitting there</p>
<p>watching this happen slack jawed. I read a book a while</p>
<p>back, and it&rsquo;s about how people react in disasters. Trying to</p>
<p>remember what it was like if the worst should occur or something</p>
<p>like that. I think we talked about it once. But but it&rsquo;s by</p>
<p>one of these experts who studies these things. And one of the</p>
<p>things that they said is in situations like this, right</p>
<p>plane crashes or shipwrecks or whatnot. Most people are like</p>
<p>stunned into numbness. They don&rsquo;t do anything. Right. And</p>
<p>some of these bad plane crashes, everybody could have gotten out</p>
<p>but they sat there and burned to death. You know, on the tarmac.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s shocking, but that&rsquo;s what you would expect to happen on a</p>
<p>ship like this. And yet, maybe it&rsquo;s the military training. Who</p>
<p>knows, maybe it&rsquo;s the fact you have officers barking out</p>
<p>orders, but you&rsquo;re not seeing a ton of that. You are seeing</p>
<p>people jumping in the water as fast as they can go because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all afraid of the same thing. When a big ship goes</p>
<p>down, it sucks stuff down with it. A lot of the time, it</p>
<p>creates a vacuum that can drown swimmers who are anywhere</p>
<p>nearby. So everyone knows that the ship&rsquo;s going down, you got</p>
<p>to get as far away from it as possible. It&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>when you get into an auto wreck, and you&rsquo;re worried that the</p>
<p>gasoline is leaking in the car is going to catch on fire, you</p>
<p>want to get far away from it. Well, when the ship goes down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to suck everything down with it. And several of the</p>
<p>survivors, once again, imagine this, what one of them talks</p>
<p>about having it feel as though somebody was yanking his foot and</p>
<p>his shoe came off. And all of a sudden, with a life vest, he</p>
<p>went way underwater to where his ears are popping and his eyes</p>
<p>feel like they&rsquo;re gonna, you know, pop out of his head. And</p>
<p>then he said he got caught in a giant air bubble, you know, that</p>
<p>escaped from the sinking ship, and it goes, pops him up and</p>
<p>shoots him up. He said three feet into the air before he came</p>
<p>down again, in an absolutely pitch black ocean, covered as</p>
<p>far as the eye could see, if it could see in the dark, with a</p>
<p>two inch thick molasses like consistency oil spill from the</p>
<p>ship that is burning the eyes and coating all of these men.</p>
<p>And if you ever look at photographs of people being</p>
<p>rescued from like, their ship being torpedoed when maybe they</p>
<p>were in the Merchant Marine, maybe they were on a destroyer,</p>
<p>but you can kind of see there&rsquo;s some great life magazine ones I</p>
<p>recall. And when they come on board, they&rsquo;re covered in oil.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what these people are instantly covered in. And what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worse is that oil can catch on fire and the surface of the</p>
<p>ocean can burn. That happened if you look at movie footage, you</p>
<p>can see that happened at Pearl Harbor, you know, the ocean</p>
<p>caught on fire in places. So at this point, what you have is the</p>
<p>equivalent of like, the Titanic sinking, or the Lusitania&rsquo;s</p>
<p>torpedoing, you know, big ship going down in the middle of the</p>
<p>ocean. Now difference between both the Titanic and the</p>
<p>Lusitania, though, if I can boil it down to one thing is the</p>
<p>temperature. When the Titanic sank, you had icebergs, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cold. The Lusitania went down, sort of over by Ireland, I</p>
<p>believe, cold water, you&rsquo;re not going to have people surviving a</p>
<p>long time in the water. Now, if you&rsquo;re trying to rescue them</p>
<p>actively, this is a nightmarish situation, right? You&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>get to the people before they, you know, get hypothermia, and</p>
<p>they die in the water. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>die anyway, in the water in the Pacific, in the very tropical</p>
<p>warm regions, you might wish it had come as quickly as cold</p>
<p>water. Because with the water as warm as it is sometimes slightly</p>
<p>over 80 degrees, you can stay in the water a long time. Good</p>
<p>thing if you&rsquo;re trying to be rescued. Bad things if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other things in the water, you know, besides you, that you need</p>
<p>to worry about. Also bad if you don&rsquo;t have any fresh water,</p>
<p>which they don&rsquo;t. And all of a sudden, I think 300 or so men</p>
<p>perished right away. 900 or so men are in the water. And you</p>
<p>begin now the other part of the nightmarish thing. Um, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how many of you have been in the ocean at night in the</p>
<p>water in the ocean at night. There&rsquo;s something calm and</p>
<p>beautiful about it, isn&rsquo;t there? But there&rsquo;s something a little</p>
<p>freaky about it, too. First of all, you have no idea what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on underneath you if you&rsquo;re in the deep areas, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there&rsquo;s a whole world of ocean underneath</p>
<p>you. What&rsquo;s more is if there&rsquo;s no moon out, it can get pitch</p>
<p>black, and you can&rsquo;t see anything. So now when we talk</p>
<p>about personal things that would bother us, we&rsquo;re getting into my</p>
<p>own personal nightmares a little bit here because you throw me</p>
<p>out in the middle of the ocean in pitch black darkness. That</p>
<p>is so I&rsquo;m already going to have some psychological problems, I</p>
<p>think. And I do think that this is why these stories fascinate</p>
<p>me because these figures in the story, because of things like</p>
<p>war are cast into situations that are, well, unimaginable.</p>
<p>And if they just gave up, we would totally understand the</p>
<p>fact that they don&rsquo;t is, you know, it&rsquo;s the old, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cliche, but it&rsquo;s the triumph of the human species, right? And</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be honest, a bunch of people do give up in this story.</p>
<p>And you can totally sympathize with them, too, when you hear</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;ve gone through. So the story continues, and you</p>
<p>begin to find, you know, the men, you know, as the light of</p>
<p>day breaks out, in groups, they&rsquo;re all in clusters spread</p>
<p>out over a great distance, you know, calling to each other</p>
<p>trying to find each other trying to sort of swim to each other as</p>
<p>best they can. The horrible part of this story now when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the water, though, is a lot of people have horrible</p>
<p>injuries, you didn&rsquo;t have a bunch of healthy, you know,</p>
<p>ready to go lifeguard type people jump in the water, you</p>
<p>had a bunch of shipwreck survivors, people who&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, one guy in the story. And once again, I always try to</p>
<p>remember that the people who were with these people who</p>
<p>survived carry these memories with them forever. But one guy</p>
<p>in this story, a friend of one of the people he keeps quoting</p>
<p>in the book, Stanton has his eyes completely burned out. And</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to die, but it&rsquo;s going to take him time, but</p>
<p>nobody wants to leave him. Again, you see these higher</p>
<p>qualities come to the fore where, I mean, nobody might</p>
<p>survive this, but we&rsquo;re going to take a guy who&rsquo;s certainly not</p>
<p>going to survive it and expend, you know, important energy that</p>
<p>could be spent on living people that are, you know, could go</p>
<p>either way. But that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the higher human qualities,</p>
<p>right. And so he talks about this guy eventually saying, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to make it. I want here&rsquo;s what I want you to tell</p>
<p>my wife, you know, and all these kind of things, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrenching. Once again, I can&rsquo;t help but think that if the</p>
<p>person, I think he&rsquo;s a doctor, who&rsquo;s hearing this man with the</p>
<p>burned out eyes, tell him, you know, here&rsquo;s what I want you to</p>
<p>tell my wife, if he&rsquo;s in no danger at all, he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>take that memory to the grave with him, right, probably going</p>
<p>to drink a lot more whiskey than he otherwise would have</p>
<p>drank in his life, because that is such a emotionally impacting</p>
<p>moment. But he himself is about to go through this harrowing</p>
<p>experience. And it&rsquo;s going to be one hammer blow to the psyche of</p>
<p>these people. After another, you have a lot of wounded people in</p>
<p>the water bleeding, a lot of burns. And as you all know,</p>
<p>burns are particularly nasty and horrible. And not enough life</p>
<p>jackets, people floating on flotsam and jetsam. The guy I</p>
<p>just mentioned, who had to hear, you know, what the dying sailor</p>
<p>wanted his wife told was named Dr. Haynes. And he&rsquo;s quoted by</p>
<p>Stanton in the book. And this incident is particularly</p>
<p>highlighted. And by the way, people are vomiting because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ingested saltwater and fuel oil. Stanton writes, quote,</p>
<p>a few boys were vomiting so violently that they were</p>
<p>actually doing somersaults in the water. Trying to keep calm,</p>
<p>Haynes called out, here, right here, where&rsquo;s the sick sailor?</p>
<p>And then he moved into the throng. About a dozen sailors</p>
<p>were holding a body aloft, an amazing feat of strength,</p>
<p>considering that they were all treading water furiously to stay</p>
<p>afloat beneath the added weight. The man in question was in</p>
<p>terrible shape, Stanton writes. His eyes had been burned away.</p>
<p>The flesh on his hands was gone. And what remained were bare</p>
<p>tendons. The boys held him up in an effort to keep these wounds</p>
<p>out of the stinging bath of saltwater. Haynes recognized the</p>
<p>man as his good friend and liberty buddy, Gunnery Officer</p>
<p>Stanley Lipski. Miraculously, Lipski had made his way blind</p>
<p>from the quarterdeck, off the ship, and into the water. Haynes</p>
<p>knew that Lipski&rsquo;s pain must be intolerable. He himself could</p>
<p>barely look at his old friend, who was moaning softly. Stanley,</p>
<p>he knew, was one tough bird. Haynes also understood that he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have long to live. Reluctantly, he turned away to</p>
<p>those he could actually help.&quot; And yet that guy with the burned</p>
<p>out eyes will make it onto a life raft and eventually tell</p>
<p>that same doctor, you know, what he wants his wife to know, last</p>
<p>words and, you know, get married again after me and all that. Now</p>
<p>I should point out that at this point in the story, you know, it</p>
<p>could be a war story from many theaters, many different kinds</p>
<p>of conflicts over many different eras. The part, though, that is</p>
<p>about to happen now, the part that inspired me to talk about</p>
<p>this, perhaps tapping into, you know, your own secret</p>
<p>nightmares, is a little bit different. And no doubt it</p>
<p>happened many times in history not recorded on anyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>parchment or, you know, logs anywhere. But this happened in</p>
<p>close enough to modern times that we have many, many, many</p>
<p>gruesome memories written down by survivors of what it was like</p>
<p>to go down in the middle of the ocean with sharks everywhere.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the drone footage? Some of it came out</p>
<p>recently, they were showing I think it was the Florida coast</p>
<p>from a drone above, I don&rsquo;t know, I wanna say 500 feet, 1000</p>
<p>feet above just the coastline. So it was, you know, basically</p>
<p>taking pictures of 100 yards offshore. And it appears to be</p>
<p>schools of fish. That&rsquo;s what it looks like if you&rsquo;re not paying</p>
<p>close attention. So you know, lots of fish. It&rsquo;s not, you</p>
<p>know, fish in the general term, I guess it&rsquo;s officially still</p>
<p>fish, but they&rsquo;re sharks. And I guess they maybe were migrating.</p>
<p>But the first thing you notice if you&rsquo;re paying attention, you</p>
<p>watch it over and over and over again, not that I&rsquo;m obsessed</p>
<p>with it or anything like that, is that most of these sharks I</p>
<p>was reading in the photograph or in the drone footage are in the</p>
<p>four to six feet range, kind of a, you know, fully grown, decent</p>
<p>sized shark from one of these particular breeds of shark. But</p>
<p>you can instantly tell amongst those average size ones, you</p>
<p>know, every now and then there are big, big, big ones. I mean,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what they are 18 feet, maybe I mean, you</p>
<p>look at them and they go, that&rsquo;s three times as long as the other</p>
<p>one. Imagine being, you know, just you&rsquo;re paragliding one day</p>
<p>off the Florida coast, and you just splash down right in the</p>
<p>middle of that. Now, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that anything will</p>
<p>happen to you, right? They may just all scatter and fright and</p>
<p>leave you totally alone. But they might not. Now, what if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bleeding at the same time, not going to make any</p>
<p>difference or wounded? What if you&rsquo;re there for a long time, and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go away? I mean, it&rsquo;s one thing to say I crash landed</p>
<p>off the coast of Florida into a school of sharks, and I swam to</p>
<p>the shore and I made it out miraculously alive. Yeah, but</p>
<p>what if you stay there for four days? Hmm. Is that a nightmare?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare in the daytime. What happens when you turn out</p>
<p>the lights on that? And what happens when the sharks start</p>
<p>attacking? Not you, but people within hearing distance of you.</p>
<p>The nightmare of the Indianapolis and the key part of</p>
<p>the monologue that Robert Shaw gives us the Quint character in</p>
<p>Jaws is what the moment when the sharks start attacking the</p>
<p>hundreds of men in the water is like. They can see them</p>
<p>underneath them. I mean, this is what&rsquo;s so freaky is that this</p>
<p>water is apparently clear to like 40 or 50 feet. You know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the tropics, it&rsquo;s a gorgeous color. As a matter of</p>
<p>fact, it&rsquo;s so bright when the sun starts hitting the water,</p>
<p>that that it&rsquo;s blinding people. And it&rsquo;s over 100 degrees in the</p>
<p>daytime. So they&rsquo;re frying the parts that are above the water.</p>
<p>If these people have life vests, a bunch of the people who are</p>
<p>floating in the water with life vests will lose everything</p>
<p>underneath the water to the sharks. And there are multiple</p>
<p>accounts of people, you know, tapping a buddy who appears to</p>
<p>be sleeping in his life vest on the water&rsquo;s surface. And having</p>
<p>you know, by the way, Quentin Jaws actually talks about this</p>
<p>too. And having them turn over like, like, like, you know, Bob,</p>
<p>if you will turn over and there&rsquo;s nothing below the waist.</p>
<p>You can see the sharks below you. Some of these sailors that</p>
<p>Stanton talks about, say that they would see some of the same</p>
<p>sharks and recognize them so often that they gave them names.</p>
<p>One sailor gave a tiger shark, a huge tiger shark, the name</p>
<p>Oscar. And eventually another sailor took a two inch penknife,</p>
<p>which is you know, nothing, and tried to stab at one of these</p>
<p>things. Some of these sailors were on a raft where it was the</p>
<p>raft was disintegrating over time, and it had a sort of a</p>
<p>lattice floor, if you will. And there was a little hole</p>
<p>developing in the floor. And these big sharks would come up</p>
<p>and stick their snouts right through. I mean, again, you saw</p>
<p>this in jars with jaws with mechanical shark stick their</p>
<p>nose right through and try to get ahold of something. The</p>
<p>sailors started kicking it in the face. To me being adrift in</p>
<p>the ocean, in the middle of the night, you know, no land</p>
<p>anywhere, no ships anywhere, no birds, no planes, and sharks all</p>
<p>around hundreds of them. To me, that is the most terrifying</p>
<p>situation I can think about. And what I what I was going to do</p>
<p>once is I was going to do either a book or maybe a TV series,</p>
<p>where the entire premise was based around the worst place you</p>
<p>can be in the world, you know, on any given moment in history,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t January 27, 1987. And Tunisia is the worst place to be</p>
<p>in the world. You know, the Battle of Cannae in Italy, worst</p>
<p>place to be to work. This is the worst place to be in the</p>
<p>world to me, on that date, and maybe any date, it takes a lot</p>
<p>of the things that are the most nasty things I can think of</p>
<p>packages them together in one horrible sort of event. And then</p>
<p>put these people in this psychological challenge where</p>
<p>day after day, they&rsquo;re in the water because nobody knows</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gone. This mission so secret delivering the components</p>
<p>for the bomb meant that they were it wasn&rsquo;t like they were</p>
<p>totally off the radar. When you read the reports, it was quite a</p>
<p>scandal after the war because the Indianapolis going down will</p>
<p>be the worst disaster in US Navy history. But there were several</p>
<p>sort of let&rsquo;s just call them variables maybe I mean, first of</p>
<p>all war, okay, variable number one, but these ships should have</p>
<p>been noticed when they were missing. There were a number of</p>
<p>little things that happened. And you can see this. I mean, the</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor attacks another one where a little variable here, if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t happen, this doesn&rsquo;t happen. I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>call it okay. But you can kind of see how it happened. And yet</p>
<p>what it meant was instead of being rescued within a</p>
<p>reasonable period of time, these people are going to be out there</p>
<p>for day after day after day, they have no water. And</p>
<p>eventually, think about the psychological torture that comes</p>
<p>from being absolutely able to see almost nothing but water,</p>
<p>but you will go crazy and then die if you start drinking the</p>
<p>water around you right again. It&rsquo;s another kind of disaster</p>
<p>movie. It&rsquo;s being stuck in the desert with water all around you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s essentially poisonous, right? And there will come a time</p>
<p>in the story where and it&rsquo;s funny because it will like spread from</p>
<p>one man to another where people will just start drinking the</p>
<p>saltwater and knowingly die or be so crazed from thirst that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care. One thing I found particularly fascinating about</p>
<p>the shark aspect that Stanton explains in his book, was the</p>
<p>idea that most of these sailors probably did not have a very</p>
<p>clear conception of sharks the way we do. I mean, Jaws was the</p>
<p>big, you know, sort of before and after moment on that, but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been fascinated with sharks ever since. He points out</p>
<p>that it was kind of the stuff of legends back in this era. And</p>
<p>the idea of confronting one had not been really talked about</p>
<p>very often. And what&rsquo;s more, he says, Stanton says that the Navy</p>
<p>kind of downplayed the danger because it wasn&rsquo;t good for</p>
<p>morale to talk about. Yeah, you could run into an 18 foot tiger</p>
<p>shark out there and they&rsquo;ll eat anything. Stanton says that</p>
<p>initially, the sharks probably mostly went after the cadavers in</p>
<p>the water. And that&rsquo;s why the real big attacks did not start</p>
<p>for a while. But that once they ran out of those to go after</p>
<p>that they started going after lone floaters in the water as</p>
<p>opposed to the ones that are all gathered into groups. And then</p>
<p>they would go after the ones at the outside of, you know, the</p>
<p>circle of people floating in the water. Stanton talks about, you</p>
<p>know, the incident that we just mentioned the sailor being cut</p>
<p>in half below the waist, and then says that there was a</p>
<p>sailor who was on the verge of drowning that was calling for</p>
<p>help. And so well, let me let Stanton pick up the story. He</p>
<p>writes, quote, at one point, Bob Goss swam away from the group</p>
<p>to aid an exhausted sailor who was on the verge of drowning.</p>
<p>The boy had clearly gone out of his head at the sight of the</p>
<p>fish, meaning the sharks circling below him. He was</p>
<p>waving his hands and calling for help. As Goss paddled out, he</p>
<p>was intercepted immediately by a large dorsal fin knifing towards</p>
<p>him. So he swam as fast as he could back to the group. The boy</p>
<p>in distress soon disappeared. As the shark attacks multiplied,</p>
<p>Stanton writes, the once optimistic boys were filled with</p>
<p>a sense of helplessness. Jack Cassidy came face to face with a</p>
<p>tiger shark that had been bothering him for so long that he</p>
<p>had even given it a name. He called the beast Oscar. He swung</p>
<p>at it with a homemade knife and buried the blade an inch deep in</p>
<p>the fish&rsquo;s tough snout. But Oscar swam away as if only</p>
<p>annoyed. Cassidy was furious. He wanted to kill the shark, but</p>
<p>he was relieved to be left alone. As the water flashed with</p>
<p>twisting tails and dorsal fins, the boys resolved to stay calm,</p>
<p>clamping their hands over their ears against the erupting</p>
<p>screams. But this resolve vanished when one of the boys was</p>
<p>dragged through the water like a fisherman&rsquo;s bobber tugged by a</p>
<p>big catfish. The victim, clenched in the uplifted jaws of a shark,</p>
<p>was pushed at waist level through the surf, screaming. Others</p>
<p>disappeared quietly without a trace, their life vests shooting</p>
<p>back up to the surface empty, the straps in shreds. As the</p>
<p>excited sharks grew more agitated, the attacks intensified</p>
<p>in ferocity.&quot; End quote. There are many people who consider the</p>
<p>shark attacks over several days against the Indianapolis</p>
<p>survivors to be the worst incident of mass shark attacks</p>
<p>in history. I would suggest that that&rsquo;s a hard one to know. Think</p>
<p>of how many ships have perished over the ages. And well, sharks</p>
<p>are not a new phenomenon, right? Nonetheless, we have very few</p>
<p>accounts like that. And when you add up all the various elements</p>
<p>working on these people, you just imagine that no one could</p>
<p>last long in that environment without losing their mind. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what begins to happen. And we&rsquo;ve seen this before, right?</p>
<p>We did a, we mentioned one guy when we were doing Blueprint for</p>
<p>Armageddon in the First World War, um, that, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny what sort of images make it into the history books and</p>
<p>what sort of memories, right? So you&rsquo;re in the First World War</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re at Passchendaele, and you see some guy stuck in the</p>
<p>mud. And with all of the things available to modern society at</p>
<p>that point in time, they can&rsquo;t get him out. And he&rsquo;s begging</p>
<p>people to help him and no one can do anything. So then they</p>
<p>come back. I forgot how many days later it was. It might have</p>
<p>only been one day. But the guy whose memory this was says the</p>
<p>guy was still in the mud, but he&rsquo;d sunk all the way up to his</p>
<p>head and he was insane, begging people to shoot him. We all have</p>
<p>a limit, right? So it should not surprise any of us when some of</p>
<p>these people start losing their minds in the water under these</p>
<p>conditions. And you know, you should also point out something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not always apparent when you&rsquo;re young. But as a 52 year</p>
<p>old person now is really apparent to me is how young most</p>
<p>of these people in this story are. In my mind, they&rsquo;re kids.</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s an adult and some of these officers are, you know,</p>
<p>old enough to have young families and whatnot. Although</p>
<p>these people were having families at 18 years old back</p>
<p>then a lot of them so a lot of them were parents. But I mean,</p>
<p>when you read the biographies of these people, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kids to me and you&rsquo;re 18, 19, 20, 21 and you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>to deal with this. I don&rsquo;t agree with von Moltke&rsquo;s line about, you</p>
<p>know, that we need war because it preserves these human</p>
<p>qualities, but you sure see them on display here, don&rsquo;t you? You</p>
<p>wish you&rsquo;d never have to see them on display again, but you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t help but marvel that people can, you know, get</p>
<p>through this and many of them don&rsquo;t. I mean, Stanton tells</p>
<p>story after story about people that consciously decide to give</p>
<p>up. That it&rsquo;s even talking about it with other people who are</p>
<p>stuck in the water that it&rsquo;s easy to do. All you have to do,</p>
<p>he says, is swim away from the group, and you will get hit by a</p>
<p>shark within 100 yards. People will drink the seawater knowing</p>
<p>it will kill them. Doug Stanton writes, quote, those with broken</p>
<p>arms and legs and backs had gone into shock and died. Others had</p>
<p>succumbed to massive bleeding or head wounds that suspended them</p>
<p>in another world. Still others simply drowned because they were</p>
<p>too exhausted to keep swimming. They&rsquo;d been afloat now without</p>
<p>food, water, shelter or sleep for over 40 hours. Of the 1196</p>
<p>crew members who&rsquo;d set sail from Guam three days earlier, probably</p>
<p>no more than 600 were still alive. In the previous 24 hours</p>
<p>alone, at least 200 had likely slipped beneath the waves or been</p>
<p>victims of shark attack. Since the sinking, he writes, each boy</p>
<p>had been floating through the hours asking himself the same</p>
<p>hard question. Will I live or do I quit? And as Tuesday unfolded,</p>
<p>some of the starved, bleeding and delirious men began to form</p>
<p>their answers. For those who gave up, death now seemed a</p>
<p>matter of destiny. They started committing suicide. Those still</p>
<p>lucid enough looked on in disbelief, he writes, as their</p>
<p>former shipmates calmly untied their life vests, took a single</p>
<p>stroke forward and sank without a word. Others suddenly turned</p>
<p>from the group and started swimming, waiting for a shark to</p>
<p>hit and then looked up in terrified satisfaction when it</p>
<p>did. Others simply fell face forward and refused to rise. A boy</p>
<p>would swim over to his buddy, lift his head by the hair from the</p>
<p>water and begin screaming for him to come to his senses. Often</p>
<p>he refused and continued to quietly drown himself.&quot; End</p>
<p>quote.</p>
<p>Now, we should point out that there are people in every Navy in</p>
<p>the Second World War that saw actual combat that had incidents</p>
<p>like that. And there were quite a few people in the merchant</p>
<p>marine and the various civilian versions that, you know, kept</p>
<p>the supplies, you know, coming across the water and handling</p>
<p>the logistics that would have their ships torpedoed who would</p>
<p>go through similar things. There&rsquo;s something perversely</p>
<p>nasty about having the water be warm enough to keep you alive</p>
<p>for days, so giving you an opportunity to be rescued you</p>
<p>never would have had in the North Atlantic, for example,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d be dead in an hour or two from the hypothermia. But</p>
<p>it also gives you time to go through what Stanton just</p>
<p>described, as I said, multiple disaster movies all wrapped into</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Now, as the hours drag on, Stanton says that the delirium</p>
<p>starts to set in. And again, the Indianapolis survivors are going</p>
<p>through all of these movie tropes that forever, the movies</p>
<p>will wrench drama and emotion and, you know, your sense of</p>
<p>feeling for the people, the fake people in these movies or</p>
<p>stories, and the Indianapolis people are going through it for</p>
<p>real. Their ship went down, remember it like 1215am, first</p>
<p>thing in the morning, but in the middle of the night on Monday,</p>
<p>Stanton writes that by Wednesday, the men start</p>
<p>attacking one another, they think they&rsquo;re seeing enemies.</p>
<p>And at one point, he writes, you know, and he says in within 10</p>
<p>minutes, an estimated 50 boys were killed by their compatriots</p>
<p>when everybody snapped at once. See, we have another movie here</p>
<p>too. It&rsquo;s like the shipwreck movie. So it&rsquo;s another kind of</p>
<p>disaster film. You know, people are stuck in rafts and dealing</p>
<p>with sharks and going crazy and not having I mean, it&rsquo;s as though</p>
<p>we tried to figure out how many things you could hit the same</p>
<p>people with before they broke. The higher human qualities</p>
<p>though, are visible throughout. I mean, the part that got me was</p>
<p>as as people start dying more and more, they need their life</p>
<p>vests because the life vests are failing, they&rsquo;re not meant to be</p>
<p>in the water that long. So you have these stories about people</p>
<p>that will, you know, go over make sure someone that they</p>
<p>think is dead has actually expired and then take their life</p>
<p>vest off. But the one guy that Stanton was quoting in the story,</p>
<p>he just he would not let them go. Without some sort of a</p>
<p>prayer, he&rsquo;d hold them close, which you know, these guys are</p>
<p>exhausted by this time. So anything more than the most</p>
<p>minimum effort is excruciating. And yet he was going to see that</p>
<p>each one of these people had a prayer said over them before he</p>
<p>let them go, you know, to be eaten by the sharks. I mean,</p>
<p>those are the little touches in a story like this, that break</p>
<p>your heart. Because those are the I mean, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>separates us from just being some mindless thing that&rsquo;s torn</p>
<p>apart by the sharks. I mean, the thinking that goes into all of</p>
<p>the I mean, that man survived, the one that said the prayers</p>
<p>over the people he had to unstrap from the life vests. What</p>
<p>are you thinking about at night, the rest of your life?</p>
<p>They will eventually be rescued by a pilot that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>looking for anybody, the pilot just kind of sees these people</p>
<p>in the water. And he swoops down low and he can see the sharks</p>
<p>attacking them. Stanton writes of a guy named Lieutenant Adrian</p>
<p>Marx, who&rsquo;s, um, you know, one of the early people on the scene</p>
<p>once they figure out they&rsquo;ve got people in the water. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because of the secrecy involving this. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know who these people are. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re going we</p>
<p>found the Indianapolis crew. One of the first questions they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to ask when they pick the first person up is who the hell</p>
<p>are you and where you&rsquo;re from. So Stanton writes, quote,</p>
<p>Lieutenant Adrian Marx reached the scene of the survivors at</p>
<p>320pm and what he found astounded him. Lieutenant</p>
<p>Atterbury informed Marx that there were a great many people</p>
<p>scattered over a wide area. He said not to drop any lifesaving</p>
<p>equipment until he made a full tour, which Marx quickly did.</p>
<p>Both pilots then decided to steer away from the people</p>
<p>clinging to the rafts and to concentrate on those held up</p>
<p>solely by vests. 30 minutes after he arrived, Marx began</p>
<p>bombing the boys with his provisions. About the same time</p>
<p>the destroyers Ralph Talbot and Madison received orders to cut</p>
<p>short their patrols near the island of Alethi and head</p>
<p>directly to the rescue site. Their ETA, 12 hours from the</p>
<p>present, sometime early Friday morning, Marx knew the situation</p>
<p>was dire. From his recon altitude of a mere 25 feet, he</p>
<p>had a clear view of the deep green sea and the hundreds of</p>
<p>sharks circling the men. Night, which he knew was the sharks</p>
<p>normal feeding period, was approaching. One of Marx&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crewmen watched as a shark attacked one of the men and</p>
<p>dragged him under. As Marx himself witnessed more attacks,</p>
<p>his anxiety grew. It looked to him as if the survivors were so</p>
<p>weak they couldn&rsquo;t even begin to fight back. End quote. And</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a footnote Stanton put in that says the sharks</p>
<p>had in fact remained a constant presence throughout the men&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ordeal, even during the daylight hours. Not long after</p>
<p>Gwyn, who was the first pilot to find the people in the water,</p>
<p>by the way, not long after Gwyn showed up, a massive shark</p>
<p>attack involving an estimated 30 fish had, in about 15 minutes,</p>
<p>taken some 60 boys perched on a floater net. End quote. That</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t begin to even do justice to the parts of the</p>
<p>story that seem, by comparison with crap like that, to be</p>
<p>nothing. I mean, how do you talk about no water and how that</p>
<p>makes you feel day after day when you&rsquo;re suffering and no</p>
<p>decent food? I mean, these no sleep the wounds. I mean, they</p>
<p>said that one boy in one of these rafts, one of the</p>
<p>survivors couldn&rsquo;t help but point out was sitting there with</p>
<p>his mouth wide open, in such pain that he couldn&rsquo;t even make</p>
<p>a noise. You ever been in a situation with a person like</p>
<p>that? Just one person in one situation? Any one of these</p>
<p>things is, you know, again, when you talk about war, the first</p>
<p>thing you think about is none of this stuff should ever happen</p>
<p>again. And then the next thing you think about is that when it</p>
<p>does, look what people can endure. And look at what they do</p>
<p>in terms of self sacrifice for another human being who&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>situation, you know, that&rsquo;s awful and a situation that you</p>
<p>yourself might be sharing. So that&rsquo;s when it becomes extra</p>
<p>heroic when some of these people are doing things like giving</p>
<p>their life vest to a guy who needs it more. It&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a good deed for someone you found on the street.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s reducing your own chances of survival to help</p>
<p>somebody else&rsquo;s chances of survival. Those are pretty</p>
<p>amazing stories. And I think the reason that we&rsquo;re so fascinated</p>
<p>with these horrible tales is there&rsquo;s something life affirming</p>
<p>about the people that get through them, and not just how</p>
<p>they conducted themselves at the time, but how it both changed</p>
<p>them. And how you know that the silent heroism of living with it</p>
<p>afterwards. And I think we, we have more understanding of that</p>
<p>now than we used to with things like PTSD, but I don&rsquo;t think we</p>
<p>even give it anywhere near the thought it deserves. I mean, we</p>
<p>all have traumatic memories in our lives. Life provides you</p>
<p>with some by default. But some people get way more than their</p>
<p>share. Can you imagine if like plugging something in the back</p>
<p>of your head like from the matrix, I could upload the</p>
<p>memories of one of these Indianapolis survivors into your</p>
<p>not just your brain, but like have it fused with your emotions.</p>
<p>So you know, you have the feelings, you could have the</p>
<p>flashbacks from an experience you never had. Imagine what that</p>
<p>would do to you pretty darn quickly, right? I just gave you</p>
<p>the memories of an Indianapolis survivor. Now imagine not being</p>
<p>able to ever get them out of your head. Now imagine going</p>
<p>through the original experience. You know, my brain never wants to</p>
<p>ever do any research on this personally, you understand, but I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t help but wonder if somehow, the cumulative effect, you</p>
<p>know, over decades of all these horrible, you know, memories and</p>
<p>flashbacks and nightmares. Does that ever come close to equaling</p>
<p>the terribleness of the experience itself? And if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, how much of it is like, you know, picking at the scab</p>
<p>continually, you know, of the wound that changed your life</p>
<p>forever. Now, we may not have gone through the wound, but</p>
<p>think about how upset you&rsquo;d be just having the memories all of</p>
<p>a sudden implanted in your head about what it was like when you</p>
<p>got it, mentally or emotionally speaking. In my mind, when you</p>
<p>look at it, the sinking of the Indianapolis is not really a war</p>
<p>story. If it was a war story, I think maybe we would have</p>
<p>included it in the series that we&rsquo;re doing on the Pacific War</p>
<p>and the war in Asia and the Second World War right now. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like that in my mind. It&rsquo;s about as connected to war</p>
<p>as I see it, as the 9-11 attacks were connected to terrorism. They</p>
<p>are the thing that creates, you know, the first domino falling</p>
<p>and a number of horrible incidents. But once the initial</p>
<p>attacks happen, you go from having a war movie, if you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>pardon the connection again, to entertainment, to a disaster</p>
<p>film, you know, like the kind I grew up with. And as I said,</p>
<p>what is so&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if amazing is a good word to use in</p>
<p>such a horrific situation. What is so frightful about what the</p>
<p>Indianapolis survivors and non-survivors had to go through</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t get to just have one disaster film be, you know,</p>
<p>their traumatic memory. They get to walk out of one of these,</p>
<p>you know, movies like, you know, the Towering Inferno and get</p>
<p>right on, you know, the Poseidon and then they get to experience</p>
<p>the Poseidon adventure. And it&rsquo;s one right after another. It is</p>
<p>as though, you know, the great gods of history were trying to</p>
<p>see exactly how much they could pile on the same group of human</p>
<p>beings. And since we&rsquo;re going to do a study here, why not have</p>
<p>hundreds of people in your sample size and see how much they</p>
<p>can take and what happens to them, you know, as you continue</p>
<p>to give them as much material as some of the people we pity the</p>
<p>most for going through terrible human experiences, what several</p>
<p>of them put together experience. That&rsquo;s why for me, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about, you know, terrible places in human history</p>
<p>to have found yourself in, or if your time machine happens to go</p>
<p>awry and you hit the button wrong and you end up in just</p>
<p>about the worst place you could, for me, that would be anywhere</p>
<p>from about July 30th to August 2nd, 1945, a couple hundred</p>
<p>miles from the nearest land in the Philippine Sea. And I would</p>
<p>definitely say if that happened to you, you would have found</p>
<p>yourself for that particular time and place in the worst</p>
<p>place in the world.</p>
<p>Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the</p>
<p>planet. What more do you need to know really than that? When</p>
<p>Audible started sponsoring our programs, they were in a similar</p>
<p>situation to podcasters, where if somebody said, what do you do?</p>
<p>I said, a podcaster, and then had to explain that for a long</p>
<p>time. Well, once upon a time, audio books were something that</p>
<p>people had to have explained to them. Now everybody understands</p>
<p>audio books. And so everyone understands Audible, the leading</p>
<p>provider. And well, to give you an idea of selection, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ever worried about that sort of thing, they have multiple books.</p>
<p>And I mean, I stopped counting it like five on the USS</p>
<p>Indianapolis sinking. So let&rsquo;s just call it an unmatched</p>
<p>selection. And if the story you just heard acts as an appetizer</p>
<p>towards finding out more, and there&rsquo;s a lot more, Audible&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>plenty to choose from. In fact, they actually have the book we</p>
<p>quoted from Stanton&rsquo;s book, In Harm&rsquo;s Way, which I&rsquo;ve read and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible, but there&rsquo;s a bunch of other ones too. If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve read that or heard this story, you can get granular. I</p>
<p>mean, there&rsquo;s a new book that just came out on the</p>
<p>Indianapolis. So you want some more information on this? You</p>
<p>want to have somebody speak to you for a little bit longer than</p>
<p>this one lasted? Well, why don&rsquo;t you go to Audible, sign up for</p>
<p>their free trial offer, you know, audible.com forward slash</p>
<p>Carlin, text my name to 500500 to get started. And you can</p>
<p>download 123. I think I stopped counting at four or five books</p>
<p>that they have on the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just one of those stories that it&rsquo;s so hard to believe that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true. And as I said, you know, there&rsquo;s almost this</p>
<p>vicarious horror movie fascination with it. And then it</p>
<p>just breaks your heart to actually think that no, this is</p>
<p>real stuff. And the basic information you&rsquo;re getting comes</p>
<p>from the mouths of the people who are experiencing this. But</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes history so compelling, at least to people</p>
<p>who have whatever it is, the gene, or just a sense of the</p>
<p>dramatic. And there&rsquo;s a reason that this story continues to</p>
<p>both fascinate, but also inspire. Why don&rsquo;t you go to</p>
<p>Audible, check out what they have available. As I said,</p>
<p>audible.com forward slash Carlin gets you into the free 30 day</p>
<p>trial, and then you can start to see what it&rsquo;s all about. I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about every angle that Audible has in terms of</p>
<p>advantages. In the old days, these were the things that were</p>
<p>new and unusual. Now you just sort of expect this sort of</p>
<p>stuff from your audio book provider. Because Audible is the</p>
<p>one that came up with all this stuff and made this the</p>
<p>standard you want to own your books, Audible lets you own your</p>
<p>books. I mean, stuff like that, that has made me happy to, you</p>
<p>know, tell you about them all this time. I mean, as I said,</p>
<p>you want a little bit more USS Indianapolis info, go to</p>
<p>audible.com forward slash Carlin sign up for a free 30 day</p>
<p>offer today own the books you get and start experiencing all</p>
<p>the little things that Audible just does right about audio</p>
<p>books.</p>
