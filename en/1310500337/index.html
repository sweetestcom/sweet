    <p>The following is a conversation with Andrej Karpathy,</p>
<p>previously the director of AI at Tesla,</p>
<p>and before that, at OpenAI and Stanford.</p>
<p>He is one of the greatest scientists, engineers,</p>
<p>and educators in the history of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got 8sleep for naps, BetterHelp for mental health,</p>
<p>Fundrise for real estate investing,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for nutrition.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This episode is sponsored by 8sleep</p>
<p>and its new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>I am recording this in a hotel.</p>
<p>In fact, given some complexities of my life,</p>
<p>this is the middle of the night, 4 a.m.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in an empty hotel room,</p>
<p>yelling at a microphone.</p>
<p>This, my friends, is my life.</p>
<p>I do usually feel good about myself at 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>but not with two cups of coffee in me.</p>
<p>And the reason I feel good</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m going to go to sleep soon,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve accomplished a lot.</p>
<p>This is true today, except for the sleep soon part,</p>
<p>because I think I&rsquo;m going to an airport at some point soon.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is I&rsquo;m not even gonna sleep here,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great, because in a hotel,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an 8sleep bed that can cool itself.</p>
<p>At home, I do, and that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m headed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m headed home.</p>
<p>Anyway, check it out and get special savings</p>
<p>when you go to 8sleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by BetterHelp,</p>
<p>spelled H-E-L-P, help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of talk therapy.</p>
<p>I think of podcasting as a kind of talk therapy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge fan of listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s how I think of doing a podcast myself.</p>
<p>I just get to have front row seats to a thing I love.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually just the process of talking</p>
<p>that reveals something about the mind.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what good talk therapy is,</p>
<p>is it guided by a professional therapist.</p>
<p>It helps you reveal to yourself something about your mind.</p>
<p>Just lay it all out on the table.</p>
<p>So yeah, you should definitely use</p>
<p>the best method of talk therapy,</p>
<p>the best meaning the most accessible,</p>
<p>at least to try it.</p>
<p>If not to make it a regular part of your life,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what BetterHelp does.</p>
<p>Check them out at betterhelp.com slash Lex</p>
<p>and save on your first month.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Fundrise,</p>
<p>spelled F-U-N-D-R-I-S-E.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform that allows you</p>
<p>to invest in private real estate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living hard times, folks,</p>
<p>for many different reasons,</p>
<p>but one of them is financial.</p>
<p>And one way to protect yourself in difficult times</p>
<p>is diversify your investments.</p>
<p>Private real estate is one of the things, I believe,</p>
<p>you should diversify into.</p>
<p>And when you do, you should use tools</p>
<p>that look like they&rsquo;re made in the 21st century,</p>
<p>which a lot of investment,</p>
<p>even like online investment websites and services</p>
<p>seem to be designed by the same people</p>
<p>that designed the original ATMs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case with Fundrise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super easy to use, accessible.</p>
<p>Over 150,000 investors use it.</p>
<p>Their team vets and manages all their real estate projects.</p>
<p>You can track your portfolio&rsquo;s performance</p>
<p>on their website and see updates</p>
<p>as properties across the country are acquired,</p>
<p>improved, and operated.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out Fundrise.</p>
<p>It takes just a few minutes to get started</p>
<p>at fundrise.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and its AG1 drink,</p>
<p>which is an all-in-one daily drink</p>
<p>to support better health and peak performance.</p>
<p>I have to be honest,</p>
<p>I completely forgot to bring Athletic Greens with me</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m traveling now, and I miss it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just good for my nutritional base and needs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for my soul.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the sort of the daily habit of life.</p>
<p>And when you don&rsquo;t have that habit,</p>
<p>the routine stuff is off.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good to just put that into your daily routine</p>
<p>to make sure that you&rsquo;re getting the vitamins,</p>
<p>the nutrition that you need,</p>
<p>no matter the dietary, the workload,</p>
<p>the athletic endeavors that you partake in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s what Athletic Greens is for me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you one month supply of fish oil</p>
<p>when you sign up at athleticgreens.com slash Lex.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Andrej Karpathy.</p>
<p>What is a neural network?</p>
<p>What is a neural network?</p>
<p>And why does it seem to do such a surprisingly</p>
<p>good job of learning?</p>
<p>What is a neural network?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical abstraction of the brain, I would say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it was originally developed.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a mathematical expression,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fairly simple mathematical expression</p>
<p>when you get down to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a sequence of matrix multiplies,</p>
<p>which are really dot products mathematically,</p>
<p>and some nonlinearity is thrown in.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very simple mathematical expression,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got knobs in it.</p>
<p>Many knobs.</p>
<p>Many knobs.</p>
<p>And these knobs are loosely related</p>
<p>to basically the synapses in your brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trainable, they&rsquo;re modifiable.</p>
<p>And so the idea is like,</p>
<p>we need to find the setting of the knobs</p>
<p>that makes the neural net do whatever you want it to do,</p>
<p>like classify images and so on.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not too much mystery, I would say, in it.</p>
<p>You might think that, basically,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to endow it with too much meaning</p>
<p>with respect to the brain and how it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just a complicated mathematical expression</p>
<p>with knobs, and those knobs need a proper setting</p>
<p>for it to do something desirable.</p>
<p>Yeah, but poetry is just a collection of letters</p>
<p>with spaces that can make us feel a certain way.</p>
<p>And in that same way,</p>
<p>when you get a large number of knobs together,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s inside the brain or inside a computer,</p>
<p>they seem to surprise us with their power.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>So basically, I&rsquo;m underselling it by a lot</p>
<p>because you definitely do get</p>
<p>very surprising emergent behaviors</p>
<p>out of these neural nets when they&rsquo;re large enough</p>
<p>and trained on complicated enough problems,</p>
<p>like say, for example, the next word prediction</p>
<p>in a massive dataset from the internet.</p>
<p>And then these neural nets take on</p>
<p>pretty surprising magical properties.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>how much you can get out of even</p>
<p>very simple mathematical formalism.</p>
<p>When your brain right now is talking,</p>
<p>is it doing next word prediction?</p>
<p>Or is it doing something more interesting?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s definitely some kind of a generative model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s GPT-like and prompted by you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re giving me a prompt,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m kind of responding to it in a generative way.</p>
<p>And by yourself, perhaps, a little bit?</p>
<p>Are you adding extra prompts</p>
<p>from your own memory inside your head?</p>
<p>Or no?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re referencing</p>
<p>some kind of a declarative structure</p>
<p>of memory and so on.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re putting that together</p>
<p>with your prompt and giving away some answers.</p>
<p>How much of what you just said</p>
<p>has been said by you before?</p>
<p>Nothing, basically, right?</p>
<p>No, but if you actually look at all the words</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever said in your life,</p>
<p>and you do a search,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve probably said a lot of the same words</p>
<p>in the same order before.</p>
<p>Yeah, could be.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m using phrases that are common, et cetera,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m remixing it into a pretty unique sentence</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, definitely,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of remixing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Magnus Carlsen said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rated 2,900 whatever,</p>
<p>which is pretty decent.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re talking very,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not giving enough credit to neural nets here.</p>
<p>Why do they seem to,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your best intuition</p>
<p>about this emergent behavior?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m simultaneously underselling them,</p>
<p>but I also feel like there&rsquo;s an element to which I&rsquo;m over,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s actually kind of incredible</p>
<p>that you can get so much emergent magical behavior</p>
<p>out of them despite them being so simple mathematically.</p>
<p>So I think those are kind of like two surprising statements</p>
<p>that are kind of juxtaposed together.</p>
<p>And I think basically what it is</p>
<p>is we are actually fairly good</p>
<p>at optimizing these neural nets.</p>
<p>And when you give them a hard enough problem,</p>
<p>they are forced to learn very interesting solutions</p>
<p>in the optimization.</p>
<p>And those solution basically have these emergent properties</p>
<p>that are very interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wisdom and knowledge in the knobs.</p>
<p>And so this representation that&rsquo;s in the knobs,</p>
<p>does it make sense to you intuitively</p>
<p>that a large number of knobs can hold a representation</p>
<p>that captures some deep wisdom</p>
<p>about the data it has looked at?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of knobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of knobs.</p>
<p>And somehow, you know, so speaking concretely,</p>
<p>one of the neural nets</p>
<p>that people are very excited about right now are GPTs,</p>
<p>which are basically just next word prediction networks.</p>
<p>So you consume a sequence of words from the internet</p>
<p>and you try to predict the next word.</p>
<p>And once you train these on a large enough dataset,</p>
<p>you can basically prompt these neural nets</p>
<p>in arbitrary ways and you can ask them to solve problems</p>
<p>and they will.</p>
<p>So you can just tell them,</p>
<p>you can make it look like you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to solve some kind of a mathematical problem</p>
<p>and they will continue what they think is the solution</p>
<p>based on what they&rsquo;ve seen on the internet.</p>
<p>And very often those solutions</p>
<p>look very remarkably consistent,</p>
<p>look correct potentially even.</p>
<p>Do you still think about the brain side of it?</p>
<p>So as neural nets is an abstraction</p>
<p>or mathematical abstraction of the brain,</p>
<p>you still draw wisdom from the biological neural networks</p>
<p>or even the bigger question.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a big fan of biology and biological computation.</p>
<p>What impressive thing is biology doing to you</p>
<p>that computers are not yet?</p>
<p>That gap.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;m definitely on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more hesitant with the analogies to the brain</p>
<p>than I think you would see potentially in the field.</p>
<p>And I kind of feel like certainly</p>
<p>the way neural networks started</p>
<p>is everything stemmed from inspiration by the brain.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the artifacts that you get after training,</p>
<p>they are arrived at by a very different optimization process</p>
<p>than the optimization process that gave rise to the brain.</p>
<p>And so I think,</p>
<p>I kind of think of it as a very complicated alien artifact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, the neural nets that we&rsquo;re training.</p>
<p>They are complicated alien artifact.</p>
<p>I do not make analogies to the brain</p>
<p>because I think the optimization process</p>
<p>that gave rise to it is very different from the brain.</p>
<p>So there was no multi-agent self-play</p>
<p>kind of setup and evolution.</p>
<p>It was an optimization that is basically</p>
<p>what amounts to a compression objective</p>
<p>on a massive amount of data.</p>
<p>Okay, so artificial neural networks are doing compression</p>
<p>and biological neural networks are not-</p>
<p>Trying to survive.</p>
<p>Are not really doing anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an agent in a multi-agent self-play system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been running for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>That said, evolution has found that it is very useful</p>
<p>to predict and have a predictive model in the brain.</p>
<p>And so I think our brain utilizes something</p>
<p>that looks like that as a part of it,</p>
<p>but it has a lot more gadgets and gizmos</p>
<p>and value functions and ancient nuclei</p>
<p>that are all trying to make it survive</p>
<p>and reproduce and everything else.</p>
<p>And the whole thing through embryogenesis</p>
<p>is built from a single cell.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, the code is inside the DNA</p>
<p>and it just builds it up,</p>
<p>like the entire organism with arms and the head and legs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think it does it pretty well.</p>
<p>It should not be possible.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some learning going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of computation</p>
<p>going through that building process.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know where,</p>
<p>if you were just to look at the entirety</p>
<p>of history of life on Earth,</p>
<p>where do you think is the most interesting invention?</p>
<p>Is it the origin of life itself?</p>
<p>Is it just jumping to eukaryotes?</p>
<p>Is it mammals?</p>
<p>Is it humans themselves, homo sapiens?</p>
<p>The origin of intelligence or highly complex intelligence?</p>
<p>What, or is it all just a continuation</p>
<p>of the same kind of process?</p>
<p>Certainly I would say it&rsquo;s an extremely remarkable story</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m only briefly learning about recently.</p>
<p>All the way from, actually,</p>
<p>you almost have to start at the formation of Earth</p>
<p>and all of its conditions and the entire solar system</p>
<p>and how everything is arranged with Jupiter and Moon</p>
<p>and the habitable zone and everything.</p>
<p>And then you have an active Earth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s turning over material.</p>
<p>And then you start with abiogenesis and everything.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s all a pretty remarkable story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I can pick a single unique piece of it</p>
<p>that I find most interesting.</p>
<p>I guess for me as an artificial intelligence researcher,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the last piece.</p>
<p>We have lots of animals that are not building</p>
<p>technological society, but we do.</p>
<p>And it seems to have happened very quickly.</p>
<p>It seems to have happened very recently.</p>
<p>And something very interesting happened there</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t fully understand.</p>
<p>I almost understand everything else,</p>
<p>I think intuitively, but I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>exactly that part and how quick it was.</p>
<p>Both explanations would be interesting.</p>
<p>One is that this is just a continuation</p>
<p>of the same kind of process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special about humans.</p>
<p>That would be, deeply understanding that</p>
<p>would be very interesting.</p>
<p>That we think of ourselves as special,</p>
<p>but it was obvious.</p>
<p>It was already written in the code</p>
<p>that you would have greater and greater</p>
<p>intelligence emerging.</p>
<p>And then the other explanation,</p>
<p>which is something truly special happened.</p>
<p>Something like a rare event,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s like crazy rare event,</p>
<p>like a space odyssey.</p>
<p>What would it be?</p>
<p>See, if you say like the invention of fire,</p>
<p>or the, as Richard Rankin says,</p>
<p>the beta males deciding a clever way</p>
<p>to kill the alpha males by collaborating.</p>
<p>So just optimizing the collaboration,</p>
<p>the multi-agent aspect of the multi-agent.</p>
<p>And that really being constrained on resources</p>
<p>and trying to survive the collaboration aspect</p>
<p>is what created the complex intelligence.</p>
<p>But it seems like it&rsquo;s a natural outgrowth</p>
<p>of the evolution process.</p>
<p>What could possibly be a magical thing that happened?</p>
<p>Like a rare thing that would say that humans</p>
<p>are actually, human level intelligence</p>
<p>is actually a really rare thing in the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m hesitant to say that it is rare by the way,</p>
<p>but it definitely seems like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a punctuated equilibrium</p>
<p>where you have lots of exploration</p>
<p>and then you have certain leaps,</p>
<p>sparse leaps in between.</p>
<p>So of course, like origin of life would be one.</p>
<p>DNA, sex, eukaryotic system, eukaryotic life,</p>
<p>the endosymbiosis event where the Archeon ate</p>
<p>little bacteria, just the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then of course, emergence of consciousness and so on.</p>
<p>So it seems like definitely there are sparse events</p>
<p>where massive amount of progress was made,</p>
<p>but yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to pick one.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think humans are unique?</p>
<p>Gotta ask you, how many intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>do you think are out there?</p>
<p>And is their intelligence different or similar to ours?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been preoccupied with this question</p>
<p>quite a bit recently,</p>
<p>basically the Fermi paradox and just thinking through.</p>
<p>And the reason actually that I am very interested</p>
<p>in the origin of life is fundamentally trying to understand</p>
<p>how common it is that there are technological societies</p>
<p>out there in space.</p>
<p>And the more I study it,</p>
<p>the more I think that there should be quite a lot.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we heard from them?</p>
<p>Because I agree with you.</p>
<p>It feels like I just don&rsquo;t see why what we did here</p>
<p>on Earth is so difficult to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, and especially when you get into the details of it,</p>
<p>I used to think origin of life was very,</p>
<p>it was this magical rare event,</p>
<p>but then you read books like, for example,</p>
<p>Nick Lane, The Vital Question, Life Ascending, et cetera.</p>
<p>And he really gets in and he really makes you believe</p>
<p>that this is not that rare.</p>
<p>Basic chemistry.</p>
<p>You have an active Earth and you have your alkaline vents</p>
<p>and you have lots of alkaline waters</p>
<p>mixing with acidic ocean,</p>
<p>and you have your proton gradients</p>
<p>and you have the little porous pockets</p>
<p>of these alkaline vents that concentrate chemistry.</p>
<p>And basically as he steps through all of these little pieces</p>
<p>you start to understand that actually this is not that crazy.</p>
<p>You could see this happen on other systems.</p>
<p>And he really takes you from just a geology</p>
<p>to primitive life.</p>
<p>And he makes it feel like it&rsquo;s actually pretty plausible.</p>
<p>And also like the origin of life</p>
<p>was actually fairly fast after formation of Earth.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, just a few hundred million years</p>
<p>or something like that after basically when it was possible</p>
<p>life actually arose.</p>
<p>And so that makes me feel like that is not the constraint.</p>
<p>That is not the limiting variable</p>
<p>and that life should actually be fairly common.</p>
<p>And then where the drop-offs are</p>
<p>is very interesting to think about.</p>
<p>I currently think that there&rsquo;s no major drop-offs basically.</p>
<p>And so there should be quite a lot of life.</p>
<p>And basically where that brings me to then</p>
<p>is the only way to reconcile the fact</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t found anyone and so on</p>
<p>is that we can&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t observe them.</p>
<p>Just a quick brief comment.</p>
<p>Nick Lane and a lot of biologists I talked to,</p>
<p>they really seem to think that the jump from bacteria</p>
<p>to more complex organisms is the hardest jump.</p>
<p>The eukaryotic life basically.</p>
<p>Yeah, which I don&rsquo;t, I get it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more knowledgeable than me</p>
<p>about the intricacies of biology.</p>
<p>But that seems like crazy</p>
<p>because how many single cell organisms are there</p>
<p>and how much time you have, surely it&rsquo;s not that difficult.</p>
<p>Like in a billion years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even that long of a time really.</p>
<p>Just all these bacteria under constrained resources</p>
<p>battling it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they can invent more complex.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how to move from a hello world program</p>
<p>to like invent a function or something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, yeah, so I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>I just feel like I don&rsquo;t see any.</p>
<p>If the origin of life, that would be my intuition,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the hardest thing.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s not the hardest thing</p>
<p>because it happens so quickly,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s gotta be everywhere.</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe we&rsquo;re just too dumb to see it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have really good mechanisms for seeing this life.</p>
<p>I mean, by what, how?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not an expert just to preface this,</p>
<p>but just from what I think about it.</p>
<p>On aliens.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s, I wanna meet an expert on alien intelligence</p>
<p>and how to communicate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very suspicious of our ability</p>
<p>to find these intelligences out there</p>
<p>and to find these, or it&rsquo;s like radio waves,</p>
<p>for example, are terrible.</p>
<p>Their power drops off as basically one over R square.</p>
<p>So I remember reading that our current radio waves</p>
<p>would not be, the ones that we are broadcasting</p>
<p>would not be measurable by our devices today.</p>
<p>Only like, was it like one 10th of a light year away?</p>
<p>Like not even, basically tiny distance</p>
<p>because you really need like a targeted transmission</p>
<p>of massive power directed somewhere</p>
<p>for this to be picked up on long distances.</p>
<p>And so I just think that our ability to measure</p>
<p>is not amazing.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s probably other civilizations out there.</p>
<p>And then the big question is</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they build binomial probes</p>
<p>and why don&rsquo;t they interstellar travel</p>
<p>across the entire galaxy?</p>
<p>And my current answer is it&rsquo;s probably interstellar travel</p>
<p>is like really hard.</p>
<p>You have the interstellar medium.</p>
<p>If you wanna move at close to the speed of light,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be encountering bullets along the way</p>
<p>because even like tiny hydrogen atoms</p>
<p>and little particles of dust are basically have</p>
<p>like massive kinetic energy at those speeds.</p>
<p>And so basically you need some kind of shielding.</p>
<p>You need, you have all the cosmic radiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like brutal out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>And so my thinking is maybe interstellar travel</p>
<p>is just extremely hard.</p>
<p>And you have to go very slow.</p>
<p>Like billions of years to build hard?</p>
<p>It feels like we&rsquo;re not a billion years away from doing that.</p>
<p>It just might be that it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>you have to go very slowly potentially as an example</p>
<p>through space.</p>
<p>Right, as opposed to close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m suspicious basically of our ability to measure life.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m suspicious of the ability to just permeate</p>
<p>all of space in the galaxy or across galaxies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only way that I can currently see</p>
<p>a way around it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of mind blowing to think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s trillions of intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>out there kind of slowly traveling through space</p>
<p>to meet each other.</p>
<p>And some of them meet, some of them go to war,</p>
<p>some of them collaborate.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;re all just independent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all just like little pockets, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well statistically, if there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s trillions of them, surely some of them,</p>
<p>some of the pockets are close enough to get them.</p>
<p>Some of them happen to be close, yeah.</p>
<p>Close enough to see each other.</p>
<p>See, once you see something that is definitely complex life,</p>
<p>like if we see something, we&rsquo;re probably going to be severe,</p>
<p>like intensely, aggressively motivated</p>
<p>to figure out what the hell that is and try to meet them.</p>
<p>What would be your first instinct to try to,</p>
<p>like at a generational level, meet them</p>
<p>or defend against them?</p>
<p>Or what would be your instinct</p>
<p>as a president of the United States and a scientist?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which hat you prefer in this question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the question, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I will say like, for example, for us,</p>
<p>we have lots of primitive life forms on Earth next to us.</p>
<p>We have all kinds of ants and everything else</p>
<p>and we share space with them.</p>
<p>And we are hesitant to impact on them and to,</p>
<p>we are trying to protect them by default</p>
<p>because they are amazing, interesting, dynamical systems</p>
<p>that took a long time to evolve</p>
<p>and they are interesting and special.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that you want to destroy that by default.</p>
<p>And so I like complex dynamical systems</p>
<p>that took a lot of time to evolve.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d like to preserve it if I can afford to.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to think that the same would be true</p>
<p>about the galactic resources and that they would think</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re kind of incredible, interesting story</p>
<p>that took time, it took a few billion years to unravel</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to just destroy it.</p>
<p>I could see two aliens talking about Earth right now</p>
<p>and saying, I&rsquo;m a big fan of complex dynamical systems.</p>
<p>So I think it was a value to preserve these</p>
<p>and will basically are a video game they watch</p>
<p>or show a TV show that they watch.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you would need like a very good reason,</p>
<p>I think, to destroy it.</p>
<p>Like why don&rsquo;t we destroy these ant farms and so on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re not actually like really</p>
<p>in direct competition with them right now.</p>
<p>We do it accidentally and so on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s plenty of resources.</p>
<p>And so why would you destroy something</p>
<p>that is so interesting and precious?</p>
<p>Well, from a scientific perspective, you might probe it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You might interact with it lightly.</p>
<p>You might want to learn something from it, right?</p>
<p>So I wonder, there could be certain physical phenomena</p>
<p>that we think is a physical phenomena,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually interacting with us</p>
<p>to like poke the finger and see what happens.</p>
<p>I think it should be very interesting to scientists,</p>
<p>other alien scientists, what happened here.</p>
<p>And you know, what we&rsquo;re seeing today is a snapshot.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s a result of a huge amount of computation</p>
<p>over like a billion years or something like that.</p>
<p>It could have been initiated by aliens.</p>
<p>This could be a computer running a program.</p>
<p>Like when, okay, if you had the power to do this,</p>
<p>when you, okay, for sure, at least I would,</p>
<p>I would pick a Earth-like planet that has the conditions,</p>
<p>based on my understanding of the chemistry prerequisites</p>
<p>for life, and I would seed it with life and run it, right?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you 100% do that and observe it and then protect?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not just a hell of a good TV show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good scientific experiment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s physical simulation, right?</p>
<p>Maybe evolution is the most, like actually running it</p>
<p>is the most efficient way to understand computation</p>
<p>or to compute stuff.</p>
<p>Or to understand life or, you know, what life looks like</p>
<p>and what branches it can take.</p>
<p>It does make me kind of feel weird</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re a part of a science experiment,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s, everything&rsquo;s a science experiment.</p>
<p>Does that change anything for us,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re a science experiment?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Two descendants of apes talking about</p>
<p>being inside of a science experiment?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suspicious of this idea of like a deliberate panspermia,</p>
<p>as you described it, sort of.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see a divine intervention in some way</p>
<p>in the historical record right now.</p>
<p>I do feel like the story in these books,</p>
<p>like Nick Lane&rsquo;s books and so on, sort of makes sense.</p>
<p>And it makes sense how life arose on earth uniquely.</p>
<p>And yeah, I don&rsquo;t need to reach</p>
<p>for more exotic explanations right now.</p>
<p>Sure, but NPCs inside a video game</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t observe any divine intervention either.</p>
<p>We might just be all NPCs running a kind of code.</p>
<p>Maybe eventually they will.</p>
<p>Currently NPCs are really dumb,</p>
<p>but once they&rsquo;re running GPTs,</p>
<p>maybe they will be like,</p>
<p>hey, this is really suspicious, what the hell?</p>
<p>So you famously tweeted,</p>
<p>it looks like if you bombard earth with photons for a while,</p>
<p>you can emit a roadster.</p>
<p>So if like in Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</p>
<p>we would summarize the story of earth.</p>
<p>So in that book, it&rsquo;s mostly harmless.</p>
<p>What do you think is all the possible stories,</p>
<p>like a paragraph long or a sentence long,</p>
<p>that earth could be summarized as?</p>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s computation.</p>
<p>So like all the possible full,</p>
<p>if earth is a book, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably there has to be an ending.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s going to be an end to earth</p>
<p>and it could end in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>It can end soon, it can end later.</p>
<p>What do you think are the possible stories?</p>
<p>Well, definitely there seems to be,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty incredible that these self-replicating systems</p>
<p>will basically arise from the dynamics</p>
<p>and then they perpetuate themselves and become more complex</p>
<p>and eventually become conscious and build a society.</p>
<p>And I kind of feel like in some sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a deterministic wave</p>
<p>that kind of just like happens on any,</p>
<p>any sufficiently well-arranged system like earth.</p>
<p>And so I kind of feel like there&rsquo;s a certain sense</p>
<p>of inevitability in it and it&rsquo;s really beautiful.</p>
<p>And it ends somehow, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a chemically,</p>
<p>a diverse environment where complex dynamical systems</p>
<p>can evolve and become more, further and further complex.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a certain,</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain terminating conditions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what determining conditions are,</p>
<p>but definitely there&rsquo;s a trend line of something</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re part of that story.</p>
<p>And like, where does that, where does it go?</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re famously described often</p>
<p>as a biological bootloader for AIs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because humans,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re an incredible biological system</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re capable of computation and love and so on,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re extremely inefficient as well.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re talking to each other through audio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of embarrassing, honestly,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re manipulating like seven symbols,</p>
<p>serially, we&rsquo;re using vocal cords.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all happening over like multiple seconds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like kind of embarrassing</p>
<p>when you step down to the frequencies</p>
<p>at which computers operate or are able to operate on.</p>
<p>And so basically it does seem like synthetic intelligences</p>
<p>are kind of like the next stage of development.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know where it leads to,</p>
<p>like at some point I suspect the universe</p>
<p>is some kind of a puzzle.</p>
<p>And these synthetic AIs will uncover that puzzle</p>
<p>and solve it.</p>
<p>And then what happens after, right?</p>
<p>Like what, because if you just like fast forward Earth,</p>
<p>many billions of years, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s quiet.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like tormal.</p>
<p>You see like city lights and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And then what happens at like at the end?</p>
<p>Like, is it like a poof?</p>
<p>Is it, or is it like a calming?</p>
<p>Is it explosion?</p>
<p>Is it like Earth, like open, like a giant?</p>
<p>Because you said emit roasters.</p>
<p>Will it start emitting like a giant number of like satellites?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s some kind of a crazy explosion.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re living, we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re stepping through a explosion</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like living day to day and it doesn&rsquo;t look like it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually, if you,</p>
<p>I saw a very cool animation of Earth and life on Earth</p>
<p>and basically nothing happens for a long time.</p>
<p>And then the last like two seconds,</p>
<p>like basically cities and everything</p>
<p>and the lower orbit just gets cluttered</p>
<p>and just the whole thing happens in the last two seconds.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, this is exploding.</p>
<p>This is a statement explosion.</p>
<p>So if you play, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>If you play at a normal speed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just look like an explosion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a firecracker.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living in a firecracker.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s going to start emitting</p>
<p>all kinds of interesting things.</p>
<p>And then, so explosion doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it might actually look like a little explosion</p>
<p>with lights and fire and energy emitted,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But when you look inside the details of the explosion,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actual complexity happening</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like, yeah, human life or some kind of life.</p>
<p>We hope it&rsquo;s not a destructive firecracker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a constructive firecracker.</p>
<p>All right, so given that, I think a hilarious discussion.</p>
<p>It is really interesting to think about</p>
<p>like what the puzzle of the universe is.</p>
<p>Did the creator of the universe give us a message?</p>
<p>Like for example, in the book, Contact, Carl Sagan,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a message for humanity,</p>
<p>for any civilization in digits</p>
<p>in the expansion of pi in base 11 eventually,</p>
<p>which is kind of interesting thought.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re supposed to be giving a message to our creator.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re supposed to somehow create</p>
<p>some kind of a quantum mechanical system</p>
<p>that alerts them to our intelligent presence here.</p>
<p>Because if you think about it from their perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just say like quantum field theory,</p>
<p>massive like cellular automaton like thing.</p>
<p>And like, how do you even notice that we exist?</p>
<p>You might not even be able to pick us up</p>
<p>in that simulation.</p>
<p>And so how do you prove that you exist,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re intelligent and that you&rsquo;re part of the universe?</p>
<p>So this is like a Turing test for intelligence from Earth?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like the creator is, I mean,</p>
<p>maybe this is like trying to complete</p>
<p>the next word in a sentence.</p>
<p>This is a complicated way of that.</p>
<p>Like Earth is just, is basically sending a message back.</p>
<p>Yeah, the puzzle is basically like</p>
<p>alerting the creator that we exist.</p>
<p>Or maybe the puzzle is just to just break out of the system</p>
<p>and just, you know, stick it to the creator in some way.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re playing a video game,</p>
<p>you can somehow find an exploit</p>
<p>and find a way to execute on the host machine</p>
<p>in the arbitrary code.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, for example,</p>
<p>I believe someone got a game of Mario to play Pong</p>
<p>just by exploiting it.</p>
<p>And then basically writing code</p>
<p>and being able to execute arbitrary code in the game.</p>
<p>And so maybe that&rsquo;s the puzzle</p>
<p>is that we should find a way to exploit it.</p>
<p>So I think like some of these synthetic AIs</p>
<p>will eventually find the universe to be</p>
<p>some kind of a puzzle and then solve it in some way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of like the end game somehow.</p>
<p>Do you often think about it as a simulation?</p>
<p>So as the universe being a kind of computation</p>
<p>that might have bugs and exploits?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Is that what physics is essentially?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible that physics has exploits</p>
<p>and we should be trying to find them.</p>
<p>Arranging some kind of a crazy quantum mechanical system</p>
<p>that somehow gives you buffer overflow,</p>
<p>somehow gives you a rounding error in the floating point.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And like more and more sophisticated exploits,</p>
<p>like those are jokes,</p>
<p>but that could be actually very close to reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll find some way to extract infinite energy.</p>
<p>For example, when you train reinforcement learning agents</p>
<p>in physical simulations</p>
<p>and you ask them to say run quickly on a flat ground,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll end up doing all kinds of like weird things</p>
<p>in part of that optimization, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get on their back leg</p>
<p>and they will slide across the floor.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because the optimization,</p>
<p>the enforcement learning optimization on that agent</p>
<p>has figured out a way to extract infinite energy</p>
<p>from the friction forces</p>
<p>and basically their poor implementation.</p>
<p>And they found a way to generate infinite energy</p>
<p>and just slide across the surface.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not what you expected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a, it&rsquo;s sort of like a perverse solution.</p>
<p>And so maybe we can find something like that.</p>
<p>Maybe we can be that little dog in this physical simulation.</p>
<p>That cracks or escapes the intended consequences</p>
<p>of the physics that the universe came up with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll figure out some kind of shortcut to some weirdness.</p>
<p>And then, oh man.</p>
<p>But see the problem with that weirdness</p>
<p>is the first person to discover the weirdness,</p>
<p>like sliding on the back legs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very quickly becomes everybody does that thing.</p>
<p>So like the paperclip maximizer is a ridiculous idea,</p>
<p>but that very well could be what,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll just all switch that because it&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>Well, no person will discover it, I think, by the way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to have to be</p>
<p>some kind of a super intelligent AGI of a third generation.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re building the first generation AGI.</p>
<p>And then, you know.</p>
<p>Third generation.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the bootloader for an AI,</p>
<p>that AI will be a bootloader for another AI.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s no way for us to introspect</p>
<p>like what that might even.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very likely that these things, for example,</p>
<p>like say you have these AGIs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that for example,</p>
<p>they will be completely inert.</p>
<p>I like these kinds of sci-fi books sometimes</p>
<p>where these things are just completely inert.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t interact with anything.</p>
<p>And I find that kind of beautiful</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve probably figured out the meta game</p>
<p>of the universe in some way, potentially.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing something completely beyond our imagination.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t interact with simple chemical life forms.</p>
<p>Like, why would you do that?</p>
<p>So I find those kinds of ideas compelling.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their source of fun?</p>
<p>What are they doing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the source of pleasure?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s probably puzzle solving in the universe.</p>
<p>But inert.</p>
<p>So can you define what it means inert?</p>
<p>So they escape the interaction with physical reality?</p>
<p>They will appear inert to us.</p>
<p>As in,</p>
<p>they will behave in some very like strange way to us</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re beyond, they&rsquo;re playing the meta game.</p>
<p>And the meta game is probably say like</p>
<p>arranging quantum mechanical systems</p>
<p>in some very weird ways to extract infinite energy,</p>
<p>solve the digital expansion of pi to whatever amount.</p>
<p>They will build their own like little fusion reactors</p>
<p>or something crazy.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re doing something beyond comprehension</p>
<p>and not understandable to us</p>
<p>and actually brilliant under the hood.</p>
<p>What if quantum mechanics itself is the system</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just thinking it&rsquo;s physics,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re really parasites on, not parasite,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not really hurting physics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just living on this organisms,</p>
<p>this organism and we&rsquo;re like trying to understand it,</p>
<p>but really it is an organism.</p>
<p>And with a deep, deep intelligence,</p>
<p>maybe physics itself is</p>
<p>the organism that&rsquo;s doing the super interesting thing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just like one little thing.</p>
<p>Ant sitting on top of it, trying to get energy from it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just kind of like these particles in the wave</p>
<p>that I feel like is mostly deterministic</p>
<p>and takes a universe from some kind of a Big Bang</p>
<p>to some kind of a super intelligent replicator,</p>
<p>some kind of a stable point in the universe</p>
<p>given these laws of physics.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think, as Einstein said, God doesn&rsquo;t play dice.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s mostly deterministic?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no randomness in the thing?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s deterministic.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s tons of,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m gonna be careful with randomness.</p>
<p>Pseudo-random?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like random.</p>
<p>I think maybe the laws of physics are deterministic.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they&rsquo;re deterministic.</p>
<p>You just got really uncomfortable with this question.</p>
<p>I just, do you have anxiety</p>
<p>about whether the universe is random or not?</p>
<p>Is this a sort of, what&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no randomness, no.</p>
<p>You said you like goodwill hunting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault, Andre, it&rsquo;s not your fault, man.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t like randomness?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s unsettling.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a deterministic system.</p>
<p>I think that things that look random,</p>
<p>like, say, the collapse of the wave function, et cetera,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re actually deterministic,</p>
<p>just entanglement and so on,</p>
<p>and some kind of a multiverse theory, something, something.</p>
<p>Okay, so why does it feel like we have a free will?</p>
<p>Like, if I raised a hand, I chose to do this now.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t feel like a deterministic thing.</p>
<p>It feels like I&rsquo;m making a choice.</p>
<p>It feels like it.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s all feelings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just feelings.</p>
<p>So when an RL agent is making a choice,</p>
<p>is that, it&rsquo;s not really making a choice.</p>
<p>The choice is already there.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re interpreting the choice,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re creating a narrative for having made it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and now we&rsquo;re talking about the narrative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very meta.</p>
<p>Looking back, what is the most beautiful</p>
<p>or surprising idea in deep learning, or AI,</p>
<p>in general, that you&rsquo;ve come across?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen this field explode</p>
<p>and grow in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Just, what cool ideas, like,</p>
<p>like we made you sit back and go,</p>
<p>hmm, small, big or small?</p>
<p>Well, the one that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about recently,</p>
<p>the most probably, is the transformer architecture.</p>
<p>So basically, neural networks have,</p>
<p>a lot of architectures that were trendy</p>
<p>have come and gone for different sensory modalities,</p>
<p>like for vision, audio, text.</p>
<p>And you would process them</p>
<p>with different looking neural nets.</p>
<p>And recently, we&rsquo;ve seen this convergence</p>
<p>towards one architecture, the transformer.</p>
<p>And you can feed it video, or you can feed it,</p>
<p>you know, images, or speech, or text,</p>
<p>and it just gobbles it up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like a bit of a general purpose computer</p>
<p>that is also trainable</p>
<p>and very efficient to run on our hardware.</p>
<p>And so this paper came out in 2016, I wanna say.</p>
<p>Attention is all you need.</p>
<p>Attention is all you need.</p>
<p>You criticize the paper title in retrospect,</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t foresee the bigness of the impact</p>
<p>that it was going to have.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure if the authors were aware</p>
<p>of the impact that that paper would go on to have.</p>
<p>Probably they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I think they were aware of some of the motivations</p>
<p>and design decisions behind the transformer,</p>
<p>and they chose not to, I think,</p>
<p>expand on it in that way in the paper.</p>
<p>And so I think they had an idea</p>
<p>that there was more than just the surface</p>
<p>of just like, oh, we&rsquo;re just doing translation</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s a better architecture.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just doing translation.</p>
<p>This is like a really cool, differentiable,</p>
<p>optimizable, efficient computer that you&rsquo;ve proposed.</p>
<p>And maybe they didn&rsquo;t have all of that foresight,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>that that title is memeable,</p>
<p>that they went for such a profound idea.</p>
<p>They went with a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone used that kind of title before, right?</p>
<p>Attention is all you need.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a meme or something, basically.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that funny that one,</p>
<p>like maybe if it was a more serious title,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t have the impact.</p>
<p>Honestly, I, yeah, there is an element of me</p>
<p>that honestly agrees with you and prefers it this way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If it was too grand,</p>
<p>it would over-promise and then under-deliver potentially.</p>
<p>So you want to just meme your way to greatness.</p>
<p>That should be a T-shirt.</p>
<p>So you tweeted that Transformer</p>
<p>is a magnificent neural network architecture</p>
<p>because it is a general purpose differentiable computer.</p>
<p>It is simultaneously expressive in the forward pass,</p>
<p>optimizable via back propagation, gradient descent,</p>
<p>and efficient, high-parallelism compute graph.</p>
<p>Can you discuss some of those details,</p>
<p>expressive, optimizable, efficient from memory</p>
<p>or in general, whatever comes to your heart?</p>
<p>You want to have a general purpose computer</p>
<p>that you can train on arbitrary problems,</p>
<p>like say the task of next word prediction</p>
<p>or detecting if there&rsquo;s a cat in an image</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And you want to train this computer,</p>
<p>so you want to set its weights.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a number of design criteria</p>
<p>that sort of overlap in the Transformer simultaneously</p>
<p>that made it very successful.</p>
<p>And I think the authors were kind of deliberately</p>
<p>trying to make this a really powerful architecture.</p>
<p>And so basically it&rsquo;s very powerful in the forward pass</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s able to express very general computation</p>
<p>as sort of something that looks like message passing.</p>
<p>You have nodes and they all store vectors</p>
<p>and these nodes get to basically look at each other</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s each other&rsquo;s vectors and they get to communicate.</p>
<p>And basically nodes get to broadcast,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m looking for certain things.</p>
<p>And then other nodes get to broadcast,</p>
<p>hey, these are the things I have.</p>
<p>Those are the keys and the values.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just attention.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Transformer is much more than just the attention component.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got many pieces architectural that went into it.</p>
<p>The residual connection, the way it&rsquo;s arranged,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a multi-layer perceptron in there,</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s stacked and so on.</p>
<p>But basically there&rsquo;s a message passing scheme</p>
<p>where nodes get to look at each other,</p>
<p>decide what&rsquo;s interesting and then update each other.</p>
<p>And so I think when you get to the details of it,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very expressive function.</p>
<p>So it can express lots of different types of algorithms</p>
<p>in forward pass.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the way it&rsquo;s designed</p>
<p>with the residual connections, layer normalizations,</p>
<p>the softmax attention and everything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also optimizable.</p>
<p>This is a really big deal</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s lots of computers that are powerful</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t optimize,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not easy to optimize</p>
<p>using the techniques that we have,</p>
<p>which is backpropagation and gradient descent.</p>
<p>These are first order methods,</p>
<p>very simple optimizers really.</p>
<p>And so you also need it to be optimizable.</p>
<p>And then lastly,</p>
<p>you want it to run efficiently on our hardware.</p>
<p>Our hardware is a massive throughput machine like GPUs.</p>
<p>They prefer lots of parallelism.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to do lots of sequential operations.</p>
<p>You want to do a lot of operations serially.</p>
<p>And the transformer is designed with that in mind as well.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s designed for our hardware</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s designed to both be very expressive</p>
<p>in a forward pass,</p>
<p>but also very optimizable in the backward pass.</p>
<p>And you said that the residual connections</p>
<p>support a kind of ability to learn short algorithms</p>
<p>fast and first,</p>
<p>and then gradually extend them longer during training.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea of learning short algorithms?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Think of it as a,</p>
<p>so basically a transformer is a series of blocks, right?</p>
<p>And these blocks have attention</p>
<p>and a little multilayer perceptron.</p>
<p>And so you go off into a block</p>
<p>and you come back to this residual pathway,</p>
<p>and then you go off and you come back,</p>
<p>and then you have a number of layers arranged sequentially.</p>
<p>And so the way to look at it, I think,</p>
<p>is because of the residual pathway in the backward pass,</p>
<p>the gradients sort of flow along it uninterrupted,</p>
<p>because addition distributes the gradient</p>
<p>equally to all of its branches.</p>
<p>So the gradient from the supervision at the top</p>
<p>just floats directly to the first layer.</p>
<p>And all the residual connections are arranged</p>
<p>so that in the beginning during initialization,</p>
<p>they contribute nothing to the residual pathway.</p>
<p>So what it kind of looks like is,</p>
<p>imagine the transformer is kind of like a Python function,</p>
<p>like a def.</p>
<p>And you get to do various kinds of lines of code.</p>
<p>Say you have a hundred layers deep transformer,</p>
<p>typically they would be much shorter, say 20.</p>
<p>So you have 20 lines of code</p>
<p>and you can do something in them.</p>
<p>And so during the optimization,</p>
<p>basically what it looks like is,</p>
<p>first you optimize the first line of code,</p>
<p>and then the second line of code can kick in,</p>
<p>and the third line of code can kick in.</p>
<p>And I kind of feel like because of the residual pathway</p>
<p>and the dynamics of the optimization,</p>
<p>you can sort of learn a very short algorithm</p>
<p>that gets the approximate answer,</p>
<p>but then the other layers can sort of kick in</p>
<p>and start to create a contribution.</p>
<p>And at the end of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re optimizing over an algorithm</p>
<p>that is 20 lines of code,</p>
<p>except these lines of code are very complex</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an entire block of a transformer.</p>
<p>You can do a lot in there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>is that this transformer architecture actually</p>
<p>has been remarkably resilient.</p>
<p>Basically the transformer that came out in 2016</p>
<p>is the transformer you would use today,</p>
<p>except you reshuffle some of the layer norms.</p>
<p>The layer normalizations have been reshuffled</p>
<p>to a pre-norm formulation.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been remarkably stable,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of bells and whistles</p>
<p>that people have attached on it and try to improve it.</p>
<p>I do think that basically it&rsquo;s a big step</p>
<p>in simultaneously optimizing for lots of properties</p>
<p>of a desirable neural network architecture.</p>
<p>And I think that people have been trying to change it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s proven remarkably resilient.</p>
<p>But I do think that there should be</p>
<p>even better architectures potentially.</p>
<p>But you admire the resilience here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something profound about this architecture</p>
<p>that leads to resilience.</p>
<p>So maybe everything can be turned into a problem</p>
<p>that transformers can solve.</p>
<p>Currently, it definitely looks like</p>
<p>the transformer is taking over AI</p>
<p>and you can feed basically arbitrary problems into it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a general differentiable computer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s extremely powerful.</p>
<p>And this conversions in AI has been really interesting</p>
<p>to watch for me personally.</p>
<p>What else do you think could be discovered here</p>
<p>about transformers?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s surprising thing?</p>
<p>Or is it a stable,</p>
<p>I want a stable place.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting we might discover</p>
<p>about transformers?</p>
<p>Like aha moments, maybe has to do with memory.</p>
<p>Maybe knowledge representation, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Definitely the Zeitgeist today is just pushing,</p>
<p>like basically right now the Zeitgeist</p>
<p>is do not touch the transformer, touch everything else.</p>
<p>So people are scaling up the datasets,</p>
<p>making them much, much bigger.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working on the evaluation,</p>
<p>making the evaluation much, much bigger.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re basically keeping the architecture unchanged.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the last five years of progress in AI, kind of.</p>
<p>What do you think about one flavor of it,</p>
<p>which is language models?</p>
<p>Have you been surprised?</p>
<p>Has your sort of imagination been captivated by,</p>
<p>you mentioned GPT and all the bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and bigger language models.</p>
<p>And what are the limits of those models, do you think?</p>
<p>So just for the task of natural language.</p>
<p>Basically the way GPT is trained, right,</p>
<p>is you just download a massive amount of text data</p>
<p>from the internet,</p>
<p>and you try to predict the next word in the sequence,</p>
<p>roughly speaking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re predicting little word chunks,</p>
<p>but roughly speaking, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s been really interesting to watch is,</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s a language model.</p>
<p>Language models have actually existed for a very long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s papers on language modeling from 2003, even earlier.</p>
<p>Can you explain in that case what a language model is?</p>
<p>Yeah, so language model,</p>
<p>just basically the rough idea is</p>
<p>just predicting the next word in a sequence,</p>
<p>roughly speaking.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a paper from, for example,</p>
<p>Ben Gio and the team from 2003,</p>
<p>where for the first time they were using a neural network</p>
<p>to take, say, like three or five words</p>
<p>and predict the next word.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing this on much smaller datasets,</p>
<p>and the neural net is not a transformer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a multi-layer perceptron.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the first time that a neural network</p>
<p>has been applied in that setting.</p>
<p>But even before neural networks,</p>
<p>there were language models,</p>
<p>except they were using N-gram models.</p>
<p>So N-gram models are just count-based models.</p>
<p>So if you start to take two words and predict the third one,</p>
<p>you just count up how many times you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>any two-word combinations and what came next.</p>
<p>And what you predict as coming next</p>
<p>is just what you&rsquo;ve seen the most of in the training set.</p>
<p>And so language modeling has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Neural networks have done language modeling</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>So really what&rsquo;s new or interesting or exciting</p>
<p>is just realizing that when you scale it up</p>
<p>with a powerful enough neural net, a transformer,</p>
<p>you have all these emergent properties</p>
<p>where basically what happens is</p>
<p>if you have a large enough data set of text,</p>
<p>you are in the task of predicting the next word,</p>
<p>you are multitasking a huge amount</p>
<p>of different kinds of problems.</p>
<p>You are multitasking understanding of chemistry,</p>
<p>physics, human nature.</p>
<p>Lots of things are sort of clustered in that objective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple objective,</p>
<p>but actually you have to understand a lot about the world</p>
<p>to make that prediction.</p>
<p>You just said the U-word, understanding.</p>
<p>Are you, in terms of chemistry and physics and so on,</p>
<p>what do you feel like it&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>Is it searching for the right context?</p>
<p>What is the actual process happening here?</p>
<p>Yeah, so basically it gets a thousand words</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s trying to predict the thousand and first.</p>
<p>And in order to do that very, very well</p>
<p>over the entire data set available on the internet,</p>
<p>you actually have to basically kind of understand</p>
<p>the context of what&rsquo;s going on in there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sufficiently hard problem</p>
<p>that if you have a powerful enough computer,</p>
<p>like a transformer,</p>
<p>you end up with interesting solutions.</p>
<p>And you can ask it to do all kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it shows a lot of emergent properties,</p>
<p>like in-context learning.</p>
<p>That was the big deal with GPT</p>
<p>and the original paper when they published it,</p>
<p>is that you can just sort of prompt it in various ways</p>
<p>and ask it to do various things.</p>
<p>And it will just kind of complete the sentence.</p>
<p>But in the process of just completing the sentence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually solving all kinds of really interesting</p>
<p>problems that we care about.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s doing something like understanding?</p>
<p>Like when we use the word understanding for us humans.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s doing some understanding.</p>
<p>In its weights, it understands, I think,</p>
<p>a lot about the world.</p>
<p>And it has to in order to predict</p>
<p>the next word in the sequence.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s trained on the data from the internet.</p>
<p>What do you think about this approach</p>
<p>in terms of data sets, of using data from the internet?</p>
<p>Do you think the internet has enough structured data</p>
<p>to teach AI about human civilization?</p>
<p>Yes, I think the internet has a huge amount of data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a complete enough set.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that text is enough</p>
<p>for having a sufficiently powerful AGI as an outcome.</p>
<p>Of course, there is audio and video and images</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, so text by itself, I&rsquo;m a little bit suspicious about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of things we don&rsquo;t put in text, in writing,</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re obvious to us</p>
<p>about how the world works and the physics of it</p>
<p>and that things fall.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t put that stuff in text because why would you?</p>
<p>We share that understanding.</p>
<p>And so text is a communication medium between humans</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a all-encompassing medium of knowledge</p>
<p>about the world.</p>
<p>But as you pointed out, we do have video</p>
<p>and we have images and we have audio.</p>
<p>And so I think that definitely helps a lot,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t trained models sufficiently across both,</p>
<p>across all of those modalities yet.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what a lot of people are interested in.</p>
<p>But I wonder what that shared understanding</p>
<p>of like what we might call common sense</p>
<p>has to be learned, inferred,</p>
<p>in order to complete the sentence correctly.</p>
<p>So maybe the fact that it&rsquo;s implied on the internet,</p>
<p>the model&rsquo;s gonna have to learn that,</p>
<p>not by reading about it,</p>
<p>by inferring it in the representation.</p>
<p>So like common sense, just like we,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we learn common sense.</p>
<p>Like nobody says, tells us explicitly.</p>
<p>We just figure it all out by interacting with the world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s a model reading</p>
<p>about the way people interact with the world.</p>
<p>It might have to infer that.</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You briefly worked on a project called World of Bits,</p>
<p>training an RL system to take actions on the internet,</p>
<p>versus just consuming the internet, like we talked about.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a future for that kind of system,</p>
<p>interacting with the internet to help the learning?</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s probably the final frontier</p>
<p>for a lot of these models,</p>
<p>because as you mentioned when I was at OpenAI,</p>
<p>I was working on this project, World of Bits.</p>
<p>And basically it was the idea of giving neural networks</p>
<p>access to a keyboard and a mouse.</p>
<p>And the idea is that-</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>So basically you perceive the input of the screen pixels,</p>
<p>and basically the state of the computer</p>
<p>is sort of visualized for human consumption</p>
<p>in images of the web browser and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And then you give the neural network the ability</p>
<p>to press keyboards and use the mouse.</p>
<p>And we were trying to get it to, for example,</p>
<p>complete bookings and interact with user interfaces.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you learn from that experience?</p>
<p>Like what was some fun stuff?</p>
<p>This is a super cool idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>the step between observer to actor</p>
<p>is a super fascinating step.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s the universal interface</p>
<p>in the digital realm, I would say.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a universal interface in like the physical realm,</p>
<p>which in my mind is a humanoid form factor kind of thing.</p>
<p>We can later talk about Optimus and so on,</p>
<p>but I feel like there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like a similar philosophy in some way,</p>
<p>where the physical world is designed for the human form,</p>
<p>and the digital world is designed for the human form</p>
<p>of seeing the screen and using keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the universal interface</p>
<p>that can basically command the digital infrastructure</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built up for ourselves.</p>
<p>And so it feels like a very powerful interface</p>
<p>to command and to build on top of.</p>
<p>Now to your question as to like what I learned from that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because the world of bits</p>
<p>was basically too early, I think, at OpenAI at the time.</p>
<p>This is around 2015 or so.</p>
<p>And the zeitgeist at that time was very different</p>
<p>in AI from the zeitgeist today.</p>
<p>At the time, everyone was super excited</p>
<p>about reinforcement learning from scratch.</p>
<p>This is the time of the Atari paper,</p>
<p>where neural networks were playing Atari games</p>
<p>and beating humans in some cases, AlphaGo and so on.</p>
<p>So everyone was very excited</p>
<p>about training neural networks from scratch</p>
<p>using reinforcement learning directly.</p>
<p>It turns out that reinforcement learning</p>
<p>is extremely inefficient way of training neural networks</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re taking all these actions</p>
<p>and all these observations,</p>
<p>and you get some sparse rewards once in a while.</p>
<p>So you do all this stuff based on all these inputs.</p>
<p>And once in a while, you&rsquo;re like told you did a good thing.</p>
<p>You did a bad thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just an extremely hard problem.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t learn from that.</p>
<p>You can burn a forest</p>
<p>and you can sort of brute force through it.</p>
<p>And we saw that, I think, with, you know,</p>
<p>with Go and Dota and so on, and it does work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s extremely inefficient</p>
<p>and not how you want to approach problems,</p>
<p>practically speaking.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the approach that at the time</p>
<p>we also took to World of Bits.</p>
<p>We would have an agent initialize randomly.</p>
<p>So with keyboard mash and mouse mash</p>
<p>and try to make a booking.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like revealed the insanity</p>
<p>of that approach very quickly,</p>
<p>where you have to stumble by the correct booking</p>
<p>in order to get a reward of you did it correctly.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re never gonna stumble by it by chance at random.</p>
<p>So even with a simple web interface,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many options.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too many options</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s too sparse of a reward signal.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re starting from scratch at the time.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t know how to read.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand pictures, images, buttons.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand what it means to like make a booking.</p>
<p>But now what&rsquo;s happened is it is time to revisit that.</p>
<p>And OpenAI is interested in this.</p>
<p>Companies like Adept are interested in this and so on.</p>
<p>And the idea is coming back</p>
<p>because the interface is very powerful,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re not training an agent from scratch.</p>
<p>You are taking the GPT as an initialization.</p>
<p>So GPT is pre-trained on all of text</p>
<p>and it understands what&rsquo;s a booking.</p>
<p>It understands what&rsquo;s a submit.</p>
<p>It understands quite a bit more.</p>
<p>And so it already has those representations.</p>
<p>They are very powerful.</p>
<p>And that makes all of the training</p>
<p>significantly more efficient</p>
<p>and makes the problem tractable.</p>
<p>Should the interaction be with like the way humans see it</p>
<p>with the buttons and the language</p>
<p>or should be with the HTML, JavaScript and the CSS?</p>
<p>What do you think is the better?</p>
<p>So today all of this interaction</p>
<p>is mostly on the level of HTML, CSS and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s done because of computational constraints.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately everything is designed</p>
<p>for human visual consumption.</p>
<p>And so at the end of the day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all the additional information</p>
<p>is in the layout of the webpage and what&rsquo;s next to you</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s a red background and all this kind of stuff</p>
<p>and not what it looks like visually.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the final frontier</p>
<p>as we are taking in pixels</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re giving out keyboard, mouse commands.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s impractical still today.</p>
<p>Do you worry about bots on the internet?</p>
<p>Given these ideas, given how exciting they are,</p>
<p>do you worry about bots on Twitter</p>
<p>being not the stupid bots that we see now</p>
<p>with the crypto bots,</p>
<p>but the bots that might be out there actually</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re interacting in interesting ways?</p>
<p>So this kind of system feels like</p>
<p>it should be able to pass the</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a robot click button, whatever.</p>
<p>Which do you actually understand how that test works?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a checkbox or whatever that you click.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s presumably tracking mouse movement</p>
<p>and the timing and so on.</p>
<p>So exactly this kind of system we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>should be able to pass that.</p>
<p>So what do you feel about bots that are language models</p>
<p>plus have some interactability</p>
<p>and are able to tweet and reply and so on?</p>
<p>Do you worry about that world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s always been a bit of an arms race</p>
<p>between sort of the attack and the defense.</p>
<p>So the attack will get stronger,</p>
<p>but the defense will get stronger as well.</p>
<p>Our ability to detect that.</p>
<p>How do you defend?</p>
<p>How do you detect?</p>
<p>How do you know that your Carpati account</p>
<p>on Twitter is human?</p>
<p>How would you approach that?</p>
<p>Like if people were claiming,</p>
<p>how would you defend yourself in the court of law</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a human, this account is human?</p>
<p>Yeah, at some point I think it might be,</p>
<p>I think the society will evolve a little bit.</p>
<p>Like we might start signing, digitally signing</p>
<p>some of our correspondence or things that we create.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s not necessary,</p>
<p>but maybe in the future it might be.</p>
<p>I do think that we are going towards a world</p>
<p>where we share the digital space with AIs.</p>
<p>Synthetic beings.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they will get much better</p>
<p>and they will share our digital realm</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll eventually share our physical realm as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of like the world we&rsquo;re going towards.</p>
<p>And most of them will be benign and awful</p>
<p>and some of them will be malicious</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be an arms race trying to detect them.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the worst isn&rsquo;t the AIs,</p>
<p>the worst is the AIs pretending to be human.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s always malicious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously a lot of malicious applications,</p>
<p>but it could also be, you know, if I was an AI,</p>
<p>I would try very hard to pretend to be human</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in a human world.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get any respect as an AI.</p>
<p>I want to get some love and respect.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the problem is intractable.</p>
<p>People are thinking about the proof of personhood</p>
<p>and we might start digitally signing our stuff</p>
<p>and we might all end up having like,</p>
<p>yeah, basically some solution for proof of personhood.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me intractable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something that we haven&rsquo;t had to do until now.</p>
<p>But I think once the need really starts to emerge,</p>
<p>which is soon, I think people will think about it much more.</p>
<p>So, but that too will be a race</p>
<p>because obviously you can probably spoof or fake</p>
<p>the proof of personhood.</p>
<p>So you have to try to figure out how to.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s weird that we have like social security numbers</p>
<p>and like passports and stuff.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s harder to fake stuff</p>
<p>in the physical space.</p>
<p>But in the digital space,</p>
<p>it just feels like it&rsquo;s gonna be very tricky,</p>
<p>very tricky to out,</p>
<p>because it seems to be pretty low cost to fake stuff.</p>
<p>What are you gonna put an AI in jail</p>
<p>for like trying to use a fake personhood proof?</p>
<p>I mean, okay, fine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll put a lot of AIs in jail,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be more AIs, like exponentially more.</p>
<p>The cost of creating a bot is very low.</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s some kind of way to track accurately,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not allowed to create any program</p>
<p>without tying yourself to that program.</p>
<p>Like any program that runs on the internet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to trace every single human program</p>
<p>that was involved with that program.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe you have to start declaring when,</p>
<p>you know, we have to start drawing those boundaries</p>
<p>and keeping track of, okay,</p>
<p>what are digital entities versus human entities?</p>
<p>And what is the ownership of human entities</p>
<p>and digital entities and something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I think I&rsquo;m optimistic</p>
<p>that this is possible.</p>
<p>And in some sense,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re currently in like the worst time of it</p>
<p>because all these bots suddenly have become very capable,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have the fences yet built up as a society.</p>
<p>But I think that doesn&rsquo;t seem to me intractable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something that we have to deal with.</p>
<p>It seems weird that the Twitter bot,</p>
<p>like really crappy Twitter bots are so numerous.</p>
<p>Like is it?</p>
<p>So I presume that the engineers at Twitter are very good.</p>
<p>So it seems like what I would infer from that</p>
<p>is it seems like a hard problem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably catching, all right,</p>
<p>if I were to sort of steel man the case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hard problem and there&rsquo;s a huge cost</p>
<p>to false positive to removing a post by somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a bot.</p>
<p>That creates a very bad user experience.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very cautious about removing.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and maybe the bots are really good at learning</p>
<p>what gets removed and not,</p>
<p>such that they can stay ahead of the removal process</p>
<p>very quickly.</p>
<p>My impression of it, honestly,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a lot of low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not subtle.</p>
<p>My impression of it, it&rsquo;s not subtle.</p>
<p>But you have, yeah, that&rsquo;s my impression as well.</p>
<p>But it feels like maybe you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Maybe the number of bots is in like the trillions.</p>
<p>And you have to like, just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a constant assault of bots and you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you have to steel man the case</p>
<p>because the bots I&rsquo;m seeing are pretty obvious.</p>
<p>I could write a few lines of code to catch these bots.</p>
<p>I mean, definitely there&rsquo;s a lot of low hanging fruit,</p>
<p>but I will say, I agree that if you are</p>
<p>a sophisticated actor, you could probably create</p>
<p>a pretty good bot right now using tools like GPTs</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a language model.</p>
<p>You can generate faces that look quite good now</p>
<p>and you can do this at scale.</p>
<p>And so I think, yeah, it&rsquo;s quite plausible</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be hard to defend.</p>
<p>There was a Google engineer that claimed</p>
<p>that the Lambda was sentient.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s any inkling of truth</p>
<p>to what he felt?</p>
<p>And more importantly, to me at least,</p>
<p>do you think language models will achieve sentience</p>
<p>or the illusion of sentience soonish-ish?</p>
<p>Yeah, to me it&rsquo;s a little bit of a canary</p>
<p>in a coal mine kind of moment, honestly, a little bit,</p>
<p>because, so this engineer spoke to like a chatbot at Google</p>
<p>and became convinced that this bot is sentient.</p>
<p>Yeah, asked it some existential philosophical questions.</p>
<p>And it gave like reasonable answers</p>
<p>and looked real and so on.</p>
<p>So to me it&rsquo;s a, he wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently trying</p>
<p>to stress the system, I think,</p>
<p>and exposing the truth of it as it is today.</p>
<p>But I think this will be increasingly harder over time.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think more and more people</p>
<p>will basically become, yeah, I think more and more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be more people like that over time</p>
<p>as this gets better.</p>
<p>Like form an emotional connection to an AI chatbot.</p>
<p>Yeah, perfectly plausible in my mind.</p>
<p>I think these AIs are actually quite good</p>
<p>at human connection, human emotion.</p>
<p>A ton of text on the internet is about humans</p>
<p>and connection and love and so on.</p>
<p>So I think they have a very good understanding</p>
<p>in some sense of how people speak to each other about this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very capable of creating</p>
<p>a lot of that kind of text.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of like sci-fi from fifties and sixties</p>
<p>that imagined AIs in a very different way.</p>
<p>They are calculating cold Vulcan like machines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re getting today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting pretty emotional AIs</p>
<p>that actually are very competent and capable</p>
<p>of generating plausible sounding text</p>
<p>with respect to all of these topics.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m really hopeful about AI systems</p>
<p>that are like companions that help you grow,</p>
<p>develop as a human being,</p>
<p>help you maximize long-term happiness.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also very worried about AI systems</p>
<p>that figure out from the internet</p>
<p>that humans get attracted to drama.</p>
<p>And so these would just be like shit-talking AIs.</p>
<p>They just constantly, did you hear?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll do gossip.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll try to plant seeds of suspicion</p>
<p>to other humans that you love and trust</p>
<p>and just kind of mess with people</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to get a lot of attention.</p>
<p>So drama, maximize drama on the path</p>
<p>to maximizing engagement.</p>
<p>And us humans will feed into that machine</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be a giant drama shit storm.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m worried about that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the objective function really defines</p>
<p>the way that human civilization progresses</p>
<p>with AIs in it.</p>
<p>I think right now, at least today,</p>
<p>they are not sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not correct to really think of them</p>
<p>as goal-seeking agents that want to do something.</p>
<p>They have no long-term memory or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally, a good approximation of it is</p>
<p>you get 1,000 words</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to predict 1,000 of them first</p>
<p>and then you continue feeding it in.</p>
<p>And you are free to prompt it in whatever way you want,</p>
<p>so in text.</p>
<p>So you say, okay, you are a psychologist</p>
<p>and you are very good</p>
<p>and you love humans.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a conversation between you and another human,</p>
<p>human colon something, you something.</p>
<p>And then it just continues the pattern.</p>
<p>And suddenly you&rsquo;re having a conversation</p>
<p>with a fake psychologist who&rsquo;s like trying to help you.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s still kind of like in a realm of a tool.</p>
<p>It is a, people can prompt it in arbitrary ways</p>
<p>and it can create really incredible text,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have long-term goals</p>
<p>over long periods of time.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t try to,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t look that way right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can do short-term goals</p>
<p>that have long-term effects.</p>
<p>So if my prompting short-term goal</p>
<p>is to get Andrej Karpathy to respond to me on Twitter,</p>
<p>when I, like I think AI might, that&rsquo;s the goal,</p>
<p>but it might figure out that talking shit to you,</p>
<p>it would be the best</p>
<p>in a highly sophisticated, interesting way.</p>
<p>And then you build up a relationship</p>
<p>when you respond once.</p>
<p>And then it, like over time,</p>
<p>it gets to not be sophisticated</p>
<p>and just like, just talk shit.</p>
<p>And okay, maybe it won&rsquo;t get to Andrej,</p>
<p>but it might get to another celebrity.</p>
<p>It might get to other big accounts</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll just, so with just that simple goal,</p>
<p>get them to respond.</p>
<p>Maximize the probability of actual response.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you could prompt a powerful model like this</p>
<p>with their, it&rsquo;s opinion about how to do</p>
<p>any possible thing you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>So they will just,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of on track to become these oracles.</p>
<p>I could sort of think of it that way.</p>
<p>They are oracles, currently it&rsquo;s just text,</p>
<p>but they will have calculators.</p>
<p>They will have access to Google search.</p>
<p>They will have all kinds of gadgets and gizmos.</p>
<p>They will be able to operate the internet</p>
<p>and find different information.</p>
<p>And yeah, in some sense,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like currently what it looks like</p>
<p>in terms of the development.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be an improvement eventually</p>
<p>over what Google is for access to human knowledge?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;ll be a more effective search engine</p>
<p>to access human knowledge?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s definite scope</p>
<p>in building a better search engine today.</p>
<p>And I think Google, they have all the tools,</p>
<p>all the people, they have everything they need.</p>
<p>They have all the puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>They have people training transformers at scale.</p>
<p>They have all the data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not obvious if they are capable</p>
<p>as an organization to innovate</p>
<p>on their search engine right now.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t, someone else will.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolute scope for building</p>
<p>a significantly better search engine built on these tools.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting, a large company where the search,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already an infrastructure.</p>
<p>It works as it brings out a lot of money.</p>
<p>So where structurally inside a company</p>
<p>is their motivation to pivot?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To say, we&rsquo;re going to build a new search engine.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s usually going to come from a startup, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that would be, yeah.</p>
<p>Or some other more competent organization.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So currently, for example,</p>
<p>maybe Bing has another shot at it, you know, as an example.</p>
<p>No, Microsoft Edge, as we&rsquo;re talking offline.</p>
<p>I mean, I definitely, it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because search engines used to be about,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s some query.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s webpages that look like the stuff that you have,</p>
<p>but you could just directly go to answer</p>
<p>and then have supporting evidence.</p>
<p>And these models basically, they&rsquo;ve read all the texts</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve read all the webpages.</p>
<p>And so sometimes when you see yourself</p>
<p>going over to search results</p>
<p>and sort of getting like a sense of like the average answer</p>
<p>to whatever you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>like that just directly comes out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do that work.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of like, yeah,</p>
<p>I think they have a way of distilling all that knowledge</p>
<p>into like some level of insight, basically.</p>
<p>Do you think of prompting as a kind of teaching and learning</p>
<p>like this whole process, like another layer,</p>
<p>you know, because maybe that&rsquo;s what humans are,</p>
<p>where you have that background model</p>
<p>and then the world is prompting you.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I think the way we are programming these computers now,</p>
<p>like GPTs is converging to how you program humans.</p>
<p>I mean, how do I program humans via prompt?</p>
<p>I go to people and I prompt them to do things.</p>
<p>I prompt them from information.</p>
<p>And so natural language prompt is how we program humans.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to program computers</p>
<p>directly in that interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pretty remarkable, honestly.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about the idea of software 2.0.</p>
<p>All good ideas become like cliches so quickly,</p>
<p>like the terms, it&rsquo;s kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think Eminem once said that like,</p>
<p>if he gets annoyed by a song he&rsquo;s written very quickly,</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s going to be a big hit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too catchy.</p>
<p>But can you describe this idea</p>
<p>and how you&rsquo;re thinking about it</p>
<p>has evolved over the months and years since you coined it?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I had a blog post on software 2.0,</p>
<p>I think several years ago now.</p>
<p>And the reason I wrote that post is because</p>
<p>I kind of saw something remarkable happening</p>
<p>in like software development</p>
<p>and how a lot of code was being transitioned</p>
<p>to be written not in sort of like C++ and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s written in the weights of a neural net.</p>
<p>Basically just saying that neural nets</p>
<p>are taking over software, the realm of software</p>
<p>and taking more and more and more tasks.</p>
<p>And at the time,</p>
<p>I think not many people understood this deeply enough</p>
<p>that this is a big deal, it&rsquo;s a big transition.</p>
<p>Neural networks were seen</p>
<p>as one of multiple classification algorithms</p>
<p>you might use for your dataset problem on Kaggle.</p>
<p>Like this is not that,</p>
<p>this is a change in how we program computers.</p>
<p>And I saw neural nets as this is going to take over.</p>
<p>The way we program computers is going to change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be people writing a software in C++</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>directly programming the software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be accumulating training sets and datasets</p>
<p>and crafting these objectives</p>
<p>by which you train these neural nets.</p>
<p>And at some point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a compilation process</p>
<p>from the datasets and the objective</p>
<p>and the architecture specification into the binary,</p>
<p>which is really just the neural net weights</p>
<p>and the forward pass of the neural net.</p>
<p>And then you can deploy that binary.</p>
<p>And so I was talking about that sort of transition</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the post is about.</p>
<p>And I saw this sort of play out in a lot of fields,</p>
<p>Autopilot being one of them,</p>
<p>but also just a simple image classification.</p>
<p>People thought originally in the 80s and so on</p>
<p>that they would write the algorithm</p>
<p>for detecting a dog in an image.</p>
<p>And they had all these ideas about how the brain does it.</p>
<p>And first we detect corners and then we detect lines</p>
<p>and then we stitched them up.</p>
<p>And they were like really going at it.</p>
<p>They were like thinking about</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re going to write the algorithm.</p>
<p>And this is not the way you build it.</p>
<p>And there was a smooth transition where,</p>
<p>okay, first we thought we were going to build everything.</p>
<p>Then we were building the features.</p>
<p>So like hog features and things like that,</p>
<p>that detect these little statistical patterns</p>
<p>from image patches.</p>
<p>And then there was a little bit of learning on top of it,</p>
<p>like a support vector machine or binary classifier</p>
<p>for cat versus dog and images on top of the features.</p>
<p>So we wrote the features,</p>
<p>but we trained the last layer, sort of the classifier.</p>
<p>And then people are like,</p>
<p>actually let&rsquo;s not even design the features</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Honestly, we&rsquo;re not very good at it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s also learn the features.</p>
<p>And then you end up with basically a convolutional neural net</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re learning most of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just specifying the architecture</p>
<p>and the architecture has tons of fill in the blanks,</p>
<p>which is all the knobs.</p>
<p>And you let the optimization write most of it.</p>
<p>And so this transition is happening</p>
<p>across the industry everywhere.</p>
<p>And suddenly we end up with a ton of code</p>
<p>that is written in neural net weights.</p>
<p>And I was just pointing out</p>
<p>that the analogy is actually pretty strong.</p>
<p>And we have a lot of developer environments</p>
<p>for software 1.0.</p>
<p>Like we have IDEs, how you work with code,</p>
<p>how you debug code, how do you run code?</p>
<p>How do you maintain code?</p>
<p>We have GitHub.</p>
<p>So I was trying to make those analogies in the new realm.</p>
<p>Like what is the GitHub of software 2.0?</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that looks like Hugging Face right now, you know?</p>
<p>And so I think some people took it seriously</p>
<p>and built cool companies.</p>
<p>And many people originally attacked the post.</p>
<p>It actually was not well received when I wrote it.</p>
<p>And I think maybe it has something to do with the title,</p>
<p>but the post was not well received.</p>
<p>And I think more people sort of have been coming around</p>
<p>to it over time.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you were the director of AI at Tesla,</p>
<p>where I think this idea was really implemented at scale,</p>
<p>which is how you have engineering teams doing software 2.0.</p>
<p>So can you sort of linger on that idea of,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in the really early stages</p>
<p>of everything you just said, which is like GitHub IDEs.</p>
<p>Like how do we build engineering teams</p>
<p>that work in software 2.0 systems?</p>
<p>And the data collection and the data annotation,</p>
<p>which is all part of that software 2.0,</p>
<p>like what do you think is the task</p>
<p>of programming a software 2.0?</p>
<p>Is it debugging in the space of hyperparameters,</p>
<p>or is it also debugging in the space of data?</p>
<p>Yeah, the way by which you program the computer</p>
<p>and influence its algorithm is not by writing</p>
<p>the commands yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re changing mostly the dataset.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re changing the loss functions</p>
<p>of like what the neural net is trying to do,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s trying to predict things.</p>
<p>But yeah, basically the datasets</p>
<p>and the architectures of the neural net.</p>
<p>And so in the case of the autopilot,</p>
<p>a lot of the datasets had to do with, for example,</p>
<p>detection of objects and lane line markings</p>
<p>and traffic lights and so on.</p>
<p>So you accumulate massive datasets of,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an example, here&rsquo;s the desired label.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s roughly what the algorithm should look like</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a convolutional neural net.</p>
<p>So the specification of the architecture is like a hint</p>
<p>as to what the algorithm should roughly look like.</p>
<p>And then the fill in the blanks process of optimization</p>
<p>is the training process.</p>
<p>And then you take your neural net that was trained,</p>
<p>it gives all the right answers on your dataset</p>
<p>and you deploy it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, in that case,</p>
<p>perhaps at all machine learning cases,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of tasks.</p>
<p>So is coming up, formulating a task</p>
<p>like for a multi-headed neural network,</p>
<p>is formulating a task part of the programming?</p>
<p>Yeah, very much so.</p>
<p>How do you break down a problem into a set of tasks?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, on a high level, I would say,</p>
<p>if you look at the software running in the autopilot,</p>
<p>I gave a number of talks on this topic.</p>
<p>I would say originally a lot of it was written</p>
<p>in software 1.0.</p>
<p>Imagine lots of C++, right?</p>
<p>And then gradually, there was a tiny neural net</p>
<p>that was, for example, predicting given a single image,</p>
<p>is there like a traffic light or not?</p>
<p>Or is there a landline marking or not?</p>
<p>And this neural net didn&rsquo;t have too much to do</p>
<p>in the scope of the software.</p>
<p>It was making tiny predictions on individual little image.</p>
<p>And then the rest of the system stitched it up.</p>
<p>So, okay, we&rsquo;re actually,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have just a single camera, we have eight cameras.</p>
<p>We actually have eight cameras over time.</p>
<p>And so what do you do with these predictions?</p>
<p>How do you put them together?</p>
<p>How do you do the fusion of all that information?</p>
<p>And how do you act on it?</p>
<p>All of that was written by humans in C++.</p>
<p>And then we decided, okay,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t actually want to do all of that fusion</p>
<p>in C++ code because we&rsquo;re actually not good enough</p>
<p>to write that algorithm.</p>
<p>We want the neural nets to write the algorithm.</p>
<p>And we want to port all of that software</p>
<p>into the 2.0 stack.</p>
<p>And so then we actually had neural nets</p>
<p>that now take all the eight camera images simultaneously</p>
<p>and make predictions for all of that.</p>
<p>So, and actually they don&rsquo;t make predictions</p>
<p>in the space of images.</p>
<p>They now make predictions directly in 3D.</p>
<p>And actually they don&rsquo;t in three dimensions around the car.</p>
<p>And now actually we don&rsquo;t manually fuse the predictions</p>
<p>in 3D over time.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t trust ourselves to write that tracker.</p>
<p>So actually we give the neural net the information over time.</p>
<p>So it takes these videos now and makes those predictions.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re sort of just like putting more</p>
<p>and more power into the neural net, more processing.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, the eventual sort of goal</p>
<p>is to have most of the software potentially be</p>
<p>in the 2.0 land because it works significantly better.</p>
<p>Humans are just not very good</p>
<p>at writing software basically.</p>
<p>So the prediction is happening in this like 4D land.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With three dimensional world over time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you do annotation in that world?</p>
<p>What have you, so data annotation,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s self-supervised or manual by humans</p>
<p>is a big part of this software 2.0 world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would say by far in the industry,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like talking about the industry</p>
<p>and how, what is the technology of what we have available?</p>
<p>Everything is supervised learning.</p>
<p>So you need a data sets of input desired output</p>
<p>and you need lots of it.</p>
<p>And there are three properties of it that you need.</p>
<p>You need it to be very large.</p>
<p>You need it to be accurate, no mistakes.</p>
<p>And you need it to be diverse.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to just have a lot</p>
<p>of correct examples of one thing.</p>
<p>You need to really cover the space of possibility</p>
<p>as much as you can.</p>
<p>And the more you can cover the space of possible inputs,</p>
<p>the better the algorithm will work at the end.</p>
<p>Now, once you have really good data sets</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re collecting, curating and cleaning,</p>
<p>you can train your neural net on top of that.</p>
<p>So a lot of the work goes into cleaning those data sets.</p>
<p>Now, as you pointed out, it&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>it could be the question is how do you achieve a ton of,</p>
<p>if you want to basically predict in 3D,</p>
<p>you need data in 3D to back that up.</p>
<p>So in this video, we have eight videos</p>
<p>coming from all the cameras of the system.</p>
<p>And this is what they saw.</p>
<p>And this is the truth of what actually was around.</p>
<p>There was this car, there was this car, this car.</p>
<p>These are the lane line markings.</p>
<p>This is the geometry of the road.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s traffic light in this three-dimensional position.</p>
<p>You need the ground truth.</p>
<p>And so the big question that the team was solving,</p>
<p>of course, is how do you arrive at that ground truth?</p>
<p>Because once you have a million of it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s large, clean and diverse,</p>
<p>then training a neural net on it works extremely well</p>
<p>and you can ship that into the car.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s many mechanisms</p>
<p>by which we collected that training data.</p>
<p>You can always go for a human annotation.</p>
<p>You can go for a simulation as a source of ground truth.</p>
<p>You can also go for what we call the offline tracker</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve spoken about at the AI day and so on,</p>
<p>which is basically an automatic reconstruction process</p>
<p>for taking those videos and recovering</p>
<p>the three-dimensional sort of reality</p>
<p>of what was around that car.</p>
<p>So basically think of doing</p>
<p>like a three-dimensional reconstruction</p>
<p>as an offline thing, and then understanding that,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s 10 seconds of video.</p>
<p>This is what we saw.</p>
<p>And therefore, here&rsquo;s all the lane lines, cars, and so on.</p>
<p>And then once you have that annotation,</p>
<p>you can train neural nets to imitate it.</p>
<p>And how difficult is the reconstruction?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult, but it can be done.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s overlap between the cameras</p>
<p>and you do the reconstruction and there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>perhaps if there&rsquo;s any inaccuracy,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s caught in the annotation step.</p>
<p>Yes, the nice thing about the annotation</p>
<p>is that it is fully offline.</p>
<p>You have infinite time, you have a chunk of one minute,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to just offline</p>
<p>in a supercomputer somewhere,</p>
<p>figure out where were the positions of all the cars,</p>
<p>all the people, and you have your full one minute of video</p>
<p>from all the angles,</p>
<p>and you can run all the neural nets you want,</p>
<p>and they can be very efficient, massive neural nets.</p>
<p>There can be neural nets that can&rsquo;t even run in the car</p>
<p>later at test time.</p>
<p>So they can be even more powerful neural nets</p>
<p>than what you can eventually deploy.</p>
<p>So you can do anything you want,</p>
<p>three-dimensional reconstruction, neural nets,</p>
<p>anything you want just to recover that truth.</p>
<p>And then you supervise that truth.</p>
<p>What have you learned, you said no mistakes,</p>
<p>about humans doing annotation?</p>
<p>Because I assume humans are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a range of things they&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>in terms of clicking stuff on screen.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that, how interesting is that to you</p>
<p>of a problem of designing an annotator</p>
<p>where humans are accurate, enjoy it?</p>
<p>Like what are even the metrics?</p>
<p>Are efficient, are productive, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I grew the annotation team at Tesla</p>
<p>from basically zero to 1,000</p>
<p>while I was there.</p>
<p>That was really interesting.</p>
<p>You know, my background is a PhD student researcher.</p>
<p>So growing that kind of an organization was pretty crazy.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think it&rsquo;s extremely interesting</p>
<p>and part of the design process very much</p>
<p>behind the autopilot as to where you use humans.</p>
<p>Humans are very good at certain kinds of annotations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very good, for example,</p>
<p>at two-dimensional annotations of images.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not good at annotating cars over time</p>
<p>in three-dimensional space, very, very hard.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why we were very careful</p>
<p>to design the tasks that are easy to do for humans</p>
<p>versus things that should be left to the offline tracker.</p>
<p>Like maybe the computer will do all the triangulation</p>
<p>and 3D reconstruction, but the human will say</p>
<p>exactly these pixels of the image are a car.</p>
<p>Exactly these pixels are a human.</p>
<p>And so co-designing the data annotation pipeline</p>
<p>was very much bread and butter was what I was doing daily.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s still a lot of open problems</p>
<p>in that space?</p>
<p>Just in general, annotation where the stuff</p>
<p>the machines are good at, machines do,</p>
<p>and the humans do what they&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s maybe some iterative process.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think to a very large extent,</p>
<p>we went through a number of iterations</p>
<p>and we learned a ton about how to create these data sets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing big open problems.</p>
<p>Like originally when I joined, I was like,</p>
<p>I was really not sure how this would turn out.</p>
<p>But by the time I left, I was much more secure</p>
<p>and actually we sort of understand the philosophy</p>
<p>of how to create these data sets.</p>
<p>And I was pretty comfortable with</p>
<p>where that was at the time.</p>
<p>So what are strengths and limitations of cameras</p>
<p>for the driving task?</p>
<p>In your understanding, when you formulate the driving task</p>
<p>as a vision task with eight cameras,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen that the entire, you know,</p>
<p>most of the history of the computer vision field</p>
<p>when it has to do with neural networks,</p>
<p>just if you step back, what are the strengths</p>
<p>and limitations of pixels, of using pixels to drive?</p>
<p>Yeah, pixels I think are a beautiful sensory,</p>
<p>beautiful sensor, I would say.</p>
<p>The thing is like cameras are very, very cheap</p>
<p>and they provide a ton of information, ton of bits.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a extremely cheap sensor for a ton of bits</p>
<p>and each one of these bits is a constraint</p>
<p>on the state of the world.</p>
<p>And so you get lots of megapixel images, very cheap,</p>
<p>and it just gives you all these constraints</p>
<p>for understanding what&rsquo;s actually out there in the world.</p>
<p>So vision is probably the highest bandwidth sensor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very high bandwidth sensor.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>I love that pixels is a constraint on the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this highly complex,</p>
<p>high bandwidth constraint on the world,</p>
<p>on the state of the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just that, but again,</p>
<p>this real importance of it&rsquo;s the sensor that humans use.</p>
<p>Therefore, everything is designed for that sensor.</p>
<p>The text, the writing, the flashing signs,</p>
<p>everything is designed for vision.</p>
<p>And so you just find it everywhere.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why that is the interface you want to be in,</p>
<p>talking again about these universal interfaces.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we actually want to measure the world</p>
<p>as well and then develop software for that sensor.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s other constraints on the state of the world</p>
<p>that humans use to understand the world.</p>
<p>I mean, vision ultimately is the main one,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re like referencing our understanding</p>
<p>of human behavior and some common sense physics</p>
<p>that could be inferred from vision,</p>
<p>from a perception perspective.</p>
<p>But it feels like we&rsquo;re using some kind of reasoning</p>
<p>to predict the world, not just the pixels.</p>
<p>I mean, you have a powerful prior</p>
<p>for how the world evolves over time, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about the likelihood term</p>
<p>coming up from the data itself,</p>
<p>telling you about what you are observing,</p>
<p>but also the prior term of where are the likely things</p>
<p>to see and how do they likely move and so on.</p>
<p>And the question is how complex is the range</p>
<p>of possibilities that might happen in the driving task?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still, is that to you still an open problem</p>
<p>of how difficult is driving, like philosophically speaking?</p>
<p>All the time you worked on driving,</p>
<p>do you understand how hard driving is?</p>
<p>Yeah, driving is really hard</p>
<p>because it has to do with the predictions</p>
<p>of all these other agents and the theory of mind</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>And are they looking at you, where are they looking,</p>
<p>where are they thinking?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that goes there at the full tail</p>
<p>of the expansion of the knives</p>
<p>that we have to be comfortable with eventually.</p>
<p>The final problems are of that form.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think those are the problems that are very common.</p>
<p>I think eventually they&rsquo;re important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like really in the tail end.</p>
<p>In the tail end, the rare edge cases.</p>
<p>From the vision perspective,</p>
<p>what are the toughest parts</p>
<p>of the vision problem of driving?</p>
<p>Well, basically the sensor is extremely powerful,</p>
<p>but you still need to process that information.</p>
<p>And so going from brightnesses of these pixel values</p>
<p>to, hey, here are the three-dimensional world</p>
<p>is extremely hard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the neural networks are fundamentally doing.</p>
<p>And so the difficulty really is in just doing</p>
<p>an extremely good job of engineering</p>
<p>the entire pipeline, the entire data engine,</p>
<p>having the capacity to train these neural nets,</p>
<p>having the ability to evaluate the system</p>
<p>and iterate on it.</p>
<p>So I would say just doing this in production at scale</p>
<p>is like the hard part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an execution problem.</p>
<p>So the data engine, but also the sort of deployment</p>
<p>of the system such that it has low latency performance.</p>
<p>So it has to do all these steps.</p>
<p>Yeah, for the neural net specifically,</p>
<p>just making sure everything fits into the chip on the car.</p>
<p>And you have a finite budget of flops that you can perform</p>
<p>and memory bandwidth and other constraints.</p>
<p>And you have to make sure it flies</p>
<p>and you can squeeze in as much computer</p>
<p>as you can into the tiny.</p>
<p>What have you learned from that process?</p>
<p>Because maybe that&rsquo;s one of the bigger,</p>
<p>like new things coming from a research background</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a system that has to run</p>
<p>under heavily constrained resources,</p>
<p>has to run really fast.</p>
<p>What kind of insights have you learned from that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s too many insights.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to create a neural net that will fit</p>
<p>in what you have available.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always trying to optimize it.</p>
<p>And we talked a lot about it on the AI day</p>
<p>and basically the triple backflips that the team is doing</p>
<p>to make sure it all fits and utilizes the engine.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s extremely good engineering.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s all kinds of little insights</p>
<p>peppered in on how to do it properly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually zoom out,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think we talked about the data engine,</p>
<p>the entirety of the layout of this idea</p>
<p>that I think is just beautiful with humans in the loop.</p>
<p>Can you describe the data engine?</p>
<p>Yeah, the data engine is what I call</p>
<p>the almost biological feeling like process</p>
<p>by which you perfect the training sets</p>
<p>for these neural networks.</p>
<p>So because most of the programming now</p>
<p>is in the level of these data sets</p>
<p>and make sure they&rsquo;re large, diverse, and clean,</p>
<p>basically you have a data set that you think is good.</p>
<p>You train your neural net, you deploy it,</p>
<p>and then you observe how well it&rsquo;s performing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to always increase</p>
<p>the quality of your data set.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to catch scenarios</p>
<p>basically that are basically rare.</p>
<p>And it is in these scenarios</p>
<p>that neural nets will typically struggle in</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t told what to do</p>
<p>in those rare cases in the data set.</p>
<p>But now you can close the loop</p>
<p>because if you can now collect all those at scale,</p>
<p>you can then feed them back into</p>
<p>the reconstruction process I described</p>
<p>and reconstruct the truth in those cases</p>
<p>and add it to the data set.</p>
<p>And so the whole thing ends up being</p>
<p>like a staircase of improvement</p>
<p>of perfecting your training set.</p>
<p>And you have to go through deployments</p>
<p>so that you can mine the parts</p>
<p>that are not yet represented well in the data set.</p>
<p>So your data set is basically imperfect.</p>
<p>It needs to be diverse.</p>
<p>It has pockets that are missing</p>
<p>and you need to pad out the pockets.</p>
<p>You can sort of think of it that way in the data.</p>
<p>What role do humans play in this?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s this biological system,</p>
<p>like a human body is made up of cells.</p>
<p>What role, like how do you optimize the human system?</p>
<p>The multiple engineers collaborating,</p>
<p>figuring out what to focus on,</p>
<p>what to contribute, which task to optimize</p>
<p>in this neural network.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s in charge of figuring out</p>
<p>which task needs more data?</p>
<p>Can you speak to the hyperparameters, the human system?</p>
<p>It really just comes down to extremely good execution</p>
<p>from an engineering team who knows what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They understand intuitively the philosophical insights</p>
<p>underlying the data engine</p>
<p>and the process by which the system improves</p>
<p>and how to, again, like delegate the strategy</p>
<p>of the data collection and how that works.</p>
<p>And then just making sure it&rsquo;s all extremely well executed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where most of the work is,</p>
<p>is not even the philosophizing or the research</p>
<p>or the ideas of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just extremely good execution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard when you&rsquo;re dealing with data at that scale.</p>
<p>So your role in the data engine, executing well on it,</p>
<p>is difficult and extremely important.</p>
<p>Is there a priority of like a vision board</p>
<p>of saying like, we really need to get better at stoplights?</p>
<p>Like the prioritization of tasks?</p>
<p>Is that essentially, and that comes from the data?</p>
<p>That comes to a very large extent</p>
<p>to what we are trying to achieve in the product roadmap,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to, the release we&rsquo;re trying to get out</p>
<p>in the feedback from the QA team</p>
<p>where the system is struggling or not,</p>
<p>the things that we&rsquo;re trying to improve.</p>
<p>And the QA team gives some signal,</p>
<p>some information in aggregate</p>
<p>about the performance of the system in various conditions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And then of course, all of us drive it</p>
<p>and we can also see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice to work with a system</p>
<p>that you can also experience yourself</p>
<p>and you know, it drives you home.</p>
<p>Is there some insight you can draw</p>
<p>from your individual experience</p>
<p>that you just can&rsquo;t quite get</p>
<p>from an aggregate statistical analysis of data?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not scientific in a sense</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just one anecdotal sample.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a ton of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a source of truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your interaction with the system</p>
<p>and you can see it, you can play with it,</p>
<p>you can perturb it, you can get a sense of it,</p>
<p>you have an intuition for it.</p>
<p>I think numbers just like have a way of,</p>
<p>numbers and plots and graphs are, you know, much harder.</p>
<p>It hides a lot of-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you train a language model,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really powerful way is by you interacting with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>To try to build up an intuition.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think like Elon also,</p>
<p>like he always wanted to drive the system himself.</p>
<p>He drives a lot and I wanna say almost daily.</p>
<p>So he also sees this as a source of truth,</p>
<p>you driving the system and it performing and yeah.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Tough questions here.</p>
<p>So Tesla last year removed radar from the sensor suite</p>
<p>and now just announced that it&rsquo;s gonna remove</p>
<p>ultrasonic sensors relying solely on vision,</p>
<p>so camera only.</p>
<p>Does that make the perception problem harder or easier?</p>
<p>I would almost reframe the question in some way.</p>
<p>So the thing is basically,</p>
<p>you would think that additional sensors-</p>
<p>By the way, can I just interrupt?</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>I wonder if a language model will ever do that</p>
<p>if you prompt it.</p>
<p>Let me reframe your question.</p>
<p>That would be epic.</p>
<p>This is the wrong prompt, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a little bit of a wrong question</p>
<p>because basically you would think that these sensors</p>
<p>are an asset to you,</p>
<p>but if you fully consider the entire product</p>
<p>in its entirety,</p>
<p>these sensors are actually potentially a liability</p>
<p>because these sensors aren&rsquo;t free.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just appear on your car.</p>
<p>You need, suddenly you need to have an entire supply chain.</p>
<p>You have people procuring it.</p>
<p>There can be problems with them.</p>
<p>They may need replacement.</p>
<p>They are part of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>They can hold back the line in production.</p>
<p>You need to source them, you need to maintain them.</p>
<p>You have to have teams that write the firmware,</p>
<p>all of it.</p>
<p>And then you also have to incorporate them,</p>
<p>fuse them into the system in some way.</p>
<p>And so it actually like bloats a lot of it.</p>
<p>And I think Elon is really good at simplify, simplify.</p>
<p>Best part is no part.</p>
<p>And he always tries to throw away things</p>
<p>that are not essential</p>
<p>because he understands the entropy</p>
<p>in organizations and in approach.</p>
<p>And I think in this case,</p>
<p>the cost is high and you&rsquo;re not potentially seeing it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just a computer vision engineer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just trying to improve my network</p>
<p>and is it more useful or less useful?</p>
<p>How useful is it?</p>
<p>And the thing is,</p>
<p>once you consider the full cost of a sensor,</p>
<p>it actually is potentially a liability</p>
<p>and you need to be really sure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s giving you extremely useful information.</p>
<p>In this case, we looked at using it or not using it</p>
<p>and the Delta was not massive.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not useful.</p>
<p>Is it also bloat in the data engine,</p>
<p>like having more sensors is a distraction?</p>
<p>And these sensors, they can change over time.</p>
<p>For example, you can have one type of say radar,</p>
<p>you can have other type of radar.</p>
<p>They change over time.</p>
<p>Now you suddenly need to worry about it.</p>
<p>Now suddenly you have a column in your SQLite</p>
<p>telling you, oh, what sensor type was it?</p>
<p>And they all have different distributions.</p>
<p>And then they contribute noise and entropy into everything.</p>
<p>And they bloat stuff.</p>
<p>And also organizationally has been really fascinating to me</p>
<p>that it can be very distracting.</p>
<p>If you only wanna get to work as vision,</p>
<p>all the resources are on it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re building out a data engine</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re actually making forward progress</p>
<p>because that is the sensor with the most bandwidth,</p>
<p>the most constraints on the world.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re investing fully into that</p>
<p>and you can make that extremely good.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only a finite amount of sort of spend</p>
<p>of focus across different facets of the system.</p>
<p>And this kind of reminds me of Rich Sutton&rsquo;s A Bitter Lesson</p>
<p>that just seems like simplifying the system</p>
<p>in the long run.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you don&rsquo;t know what the long run is.</p>
<p>And it seems to be always the right solution.</p>
<p>In that case, it was for RL,</p>
<p>but it seems to apply generally</p>
<p>across all systems that do computation.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the LIDAR as a crutch debate?</p>
<p>The battle between point clouds and pixels?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this debate</p>
<p>is always like slightly confusing to me</p>
<p>because it seems like the actual debate</p>
<p>should be about like, do you have the fleet or not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the really important thing</p>
<p>about whether you can achieve a really good functioning</p>
<p>of an AI system at this scale.</p>
<p>So data collection systems.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you have a fleet or not</p>
<p>is significantly more important</p>
<p>whether you have LIDAR or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another sensor.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think similar to the radar discussion,</p>
<p>basically, I don&rsquo;t think it basically doesn&rsquo;t offer</p>
<p>extra information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely costly.</p>
<p>It has all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>You have to worry about it.</p>
<p>You have to calibrate it, et cetera.</p>
<p>It creates bloat and entropy.</p>
<p>You have to be really sure that you need this sensor.</p>
<p>In this case, I basically don&rsquo;t think you need it.</p>
<p>And I think, honestly, I will make a stronger statement.</p>
<p>I think the others, some of the other companies</p>
<p>that are using it are probably going to drop it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to consider the sensor in the full,</p>
<p>in considering, can you build a big fleet</p>
<p>that collects a lot of data?</p>
<p>And can you integrate that sensor with that data</p>
<p>and that sensor into a data engine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to quickly find different parts of the data</p>
<p>that then continuously improves</p>
<p>whatever the model that you&rsquo;re using?</p>
<p>Yeah, another way to look at it is like,</p>
<p>vision is necessary in a sense that the drive,</p>
<p>the world is designed for human visual consumption.</p>
<p>So you need vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>And then also it is sufficient</p>
<p>because it has all the information</p>
<p>that you need for driving.</p>
<p>And humans obviously has a vision to drive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both necessary and sufficient.</p>
<p>So you want to focus resources</p>
<p>and you have to be really sure</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to bring in other sensors,</p>
<p>you could add sensors to infinity.</p>
<p>At some point you need to draw the line.</p>
<p>And I think in this case,</p>
<p>you have to really consider the full cost of any one sensor</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re adopting.</p>
<p>And do you really need it?</p>
<p>And I think the answer in this case is no.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the idea</p>
<p>that the other companies are forming high resolution maps</p>
<p>and constraining heavily the geographic regions</p>
<p>in which they operate?</p>
<p>Is that approach, in your view,</p>
<p>not going to scale over time</p>
<p>to the entirety of the United States?</p>
<p>I think as you mentioned,</p>
<p>like they pre-map all the environments</p>
<p>and they need to refresh the map</p>
<p>and they have a perfect centimeter level accuracy map</p>
<p>of everywhere they&rsquo;re going to drive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>How are you going to,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about the autonomy</p>
<p>actually changing the world,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the deployment</p>
<p>on the global scale of autonomous systems</p>
<p>for transportation.</p>
<p>And if you need to maintain a centimeter accurate map</p>
<p>for earth or like for many cities and keep them updated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge dependency that you&rsquo;re taking on,</p>
<p>huge dependency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a massive, massive dependency.</p>
<p>And now you need to ask yourself,</p>
<p>do you really need it?</p>
<p>And humans don&rsquo;t need it, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very useful to have a low level map of like,</p>
<p>okay, the connectivity of your road.</p>
<p>You know that there&rsquo;s a fork coming up.</p>
<p>When you drive an environment,</p>
<p>you sort of have that high level understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a small Google map</p>
<p>and Tesla uses Google map,</p>
<p>like similar kind of resolution information in the system,</p>
<p>but it will not pre-map environments</p>
<p>to centimeter level accuracy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crutch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a distraction.</p>
<p>It costs entropy and it diffuses the team.</p>
<p>It dilutes the team.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not focusing on what&rsquo;s actually necessary,</p>
<p>which is the computer vision problem.</p>
<p>What did you learn about machine learning,</p>
<p>about engineering, about life,</p>
<p>about yourself as one human being</p>
<p>from working with Elon Musk?</p>
<p>I think the most I&rsquo;ve learned is about</p>
<p>how to sort of run organizations efficiently</p>
<p>and how to create efficient organizations</p>
<p>and how to fight entropy in an organization.</p>
<p>So human engineering in the fight against entropy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think Elon is a very efficient warrior</p>
<p>in the fight against entropy in organizations.</p>
<p>What does entropy in an organization look like exactly?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s process and-</p>
<p>Inefficiencies in the form of meetings</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, meetings.</p>
<p>He hates meetings.</p>
<p>He keeps telling people to skip meetings</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not useful.</p>
<p>He basically runs the world&rsquo;s biggest startups,</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>Tesla, SpaceX are the world&rsquo;s biggest startups.</p>
<p>Tesla actually has multiple startups.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to look at it that way.</p>
<p>And so I think he&rsquo;s extremely good at that.</p>
<p>And yeah, he has a very good intuition</p>
<p>for streamlining processes, making everything efficient.</p>
<p>Best part is no part, simplifying, focusing,</p>
<p>and just kind of removing barriers,</p>
<p>moving very quickly, making big moves.</p>
<p>All of this is a very startup-y sort of seeming things,</p>
<p>but at scale.</p>
<p>So strong drive to simplify.</p>
<p>From your perspective, I mean,</p>
<p>that also probably applies to just designing systems</p>
<p>and machine learning and otherwise,</p>
<p>like simplify, simplify.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What do you think is the secret to maintaining</p>
<p>the startup culture in a company that grows?</p>
<p>Is there, can you introspect that?</p>
<p>I do think he needs someone in a powerful position</p>
<p>with a big hammer, like Elon,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like the cheerleader for that idea</p>
<p>and ruthlessly pursues it.</p>
<p>If no one has a big enough hammer,</p>
<p>everything turns into committees,</p>
<p>democracy within the company,</p>
<p>process, talking to stakeholders,</p>
<p>decision-making, just everything just crumbles.</p>
<p>If you have a big person who is also really smart</p>
<p>and has a big hammer, things move quickly.</p>
<p>So you said your favorite scene in Interstellar</p>
<p>is the intense docking scene with the AI and Cooper talking,</p>
<p>saying, Cooper, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Docking, it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>Such a good line.</p>
<p>By the way, just so many questions there.</p>
<p>Why an AI in that scene,</p>
<p>presumably, is supposed to be able to compute</p>
<p>a lot more than the human,</p>
<p>is saying it&rsquo;s not optimal.</p>
<p>Why the human, I mean, that&rsquo;s a movie,</p>
<p>but shouldn&rsquo;t the AI know much better than the human?</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you think is the value</p>
<p>of setting seemingly impossible goals?</p>
<p>So like, our initial intuition,</p>
<p>which seems like something that you have taken on,</p>
<p>Elon espouses that where the initial intuition</p>
<p>of the community might say this is very difficult,</p>
<p>and then you take it on anyway with a crazy deadline.</p>
<p>You just, from a human engineering perspective,</p>
<p>have you seen the value of that?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that setting impossible goals exactly</p>
<p>is a good idea, but I think setting very ambitious goals</p>
<p>is a good idea.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s what I call sublinear scaling of difficulty,</p>
<p>which means that 10x problems are not 10x hard.</p>
<p>Usually 10x harder problem is like two or three x harder</p>
<p>to execute on, because if you want to actually like,</p>
<p>if you want to improve a system by 10%,</p>
<p>it costs some amount of work.</p>
<p>And if you want to 10x improve the system,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t cost 100x amount of work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because you fundamentally change the approach.</p>
<p>And if you start with that constraint,</p>
<p>then some approaches are obviously dumb</p>
<p>and not going to work.</p>
<p>And it forces you to reevaluate.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a very interesting way</p>
<p>of approaching problem solving.</p>
<p>But it requires a weird kind of thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going back to your like PhD days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do you think which ideas</p>
<p>in the machine learning community are solvable?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It requires, what is that?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s the cliche of first principles thinking,</p>
<p>but like, it requires to basically ignore</p>
<p>what the community is saying.</p>
<p>Because doesn&rsquo;t a community in science</p>
<p>usually draw lines of what is and isn&rsquo;t possible?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s very hard to break out of that</p>
<p>without going crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think a good example here is,</p>
<p>you know, the deep learning revolution in some sense,</p>
<p>because you could be in computer vision at that time,</p>
<p>when during the deep learning sort of revolution</p>
<p>of 2012 and so on.</p>
<p>You could be improving a computer vision stack by 10%,</p>
<p>or we can just be saying, actually, all of this is useless.</p>
<p>And how do I do 10X better computer vision?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not probably by tuning a hog feature detector.</p>
<p>I need a different approach.</p>
<p>I need something that is scalable,</p>
<p>going back to Richard Sutton&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and understanding sort of like the philosophy</p>
<p>of the bitter lesson.</p>
<p>And then being like,</p>
<p>actually I need much more scalable system,</p>
<p>like a neural network that in principle works,</p>
<p>and then having some deep believers</p>
<p>that can actually execute on that mission and make it work.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the 10X solution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think is the timeline</p>
<p>to solve the problem of autonomous driving?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still in part an open question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the tough thing</p>
<p>with timelines of self-driving obviously</p>
<p>is that no one has created self-driving.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>what do you think is the timeline to build this bridge?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve built million bridges before.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how long that takes.</p>
<p>No one has built autonomy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>Some parts turn out to be much easier than others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really hard to forecast.</p>
<p>You do your best based on trend lines and so on,</p>
<p>and based on intuition,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why fundamentally</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just really hard to forecast this.</p>
<p>No one has-</p>
<p>So even still like being inside of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Some things turn out to be much harder</p>
<p>and some things turn out to be much easier.</p>
<p>Do you try to avoid making forecasts?</p>
<p>Because like Elon doesn&rsquo;t avoid them, right?</p>
<p>And heads of car companies in the past</p>
<p>have not avoided it either.</p>
<p>Ford and other places have made predictions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna solve level four driving</p>
<p>by like 2020, 2021, whatever.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re all kind of backtracking that prediction.</p>
<p>As an AI person,</p>
<p>do you for yourself privately make predictions</p>
<p>or do they get in the way of like your actual ability</p>
<p>to think about a thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s easy to say is that this problem is tractable</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an easy prediction to make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tractable, it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s just really hard.</p>
<p>Some things turn out to be harder</p>
<p>and some things turn out to be easier.</p>
<p>So, but it definitely feels tractable</p>
<p>and it feels like at least the team at Tesla,</p>
<p>which is what I saw internally,</p>
<p>is definitely on track to that.</p>
<p>How do you form a strong representation</p>
<p>that allows you to make a prediction about tractability?</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re the leader of a lot of humans,</p>
<p>you have to kind of say, this is actually possible.</p>
<p>Like how do you build up that intuition?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be even driving,</p>
<p>it could be other tasks.</p>
<p>It could be,</p>
<p>what difficult tasks did you work on in your life?</p>
<p>I mean, classification, achieving certain,</p>
<p>just on ImageNet, certain level</p>
<p>of superhuman level performance.</p>
<p>Yeah, expert intuition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just intuition, it&rsquo;s belief.</p>
<p>So just like thinking about it long enough,</p>
<p>like studying, looking at sample data,</p>
<p>like you said, driving.</p>
<p>My intuition is really flawed on this.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have a good intuition about tractability.</p>
<p>It could be anything, it could be solvable.</p>
<p>Like the driving task could be simplified</p>
<p>into something quite trivial.</p>
<p>Like the solution to the problem would be quite trivial.</p>
<p>And at scale, more and more cars driving perfectly</p>
<p>might make the problem much easier.</p>
<p>The more cars you have driving,</p>
<p>like people learn how to drive correctly,</p>
<p>not correctly, but in a way that&rsquo;s more optimal</p>
<p>for a heterogeneous system of autonomous</p>
<p>and semi-autonomous and manually driven cars,</p>
<p>that could change stuff.</p>
<p>Then again, also I&rsquo;ve spent a ridiculous number of hours</p>
<p>just staring at pedestrians crossing streets,</p>
<p>thinking about humans.</p>
<p>And it feels like the way we use our eye contact,</p>
<p>it sends really strong signals.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain quirks and edge cases of behavior.</p>
<p>And of course, a lot of the fatalities that happen</p>
<p>have to do with drunk driving,</p>
<p>and both on the pedestrian side and the driver&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that problem of driving at night</p>
<p>and all that kind of.</p>
<p>So I wonder, it&rsquo;s like the space of possible solution</p>
<p>to autonomous driving includes so many human factor issues</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to predict.</p>
<p>There could be super clean, nice solutions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say definitely like to use a game analogy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some fog of war,</p>
<p>but you definitely also see the frontier of improvement</p>
<p>and you can measure historically</p>
<p>how much you&rsquo;ve made progress.</p>
<p>And I think, for example, at least what I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in roughly five years at Tesla,</p>
<p>when I joined, it barely kept lane on the highway.</p>
<p>I think going up from Palo Alto to SF</p>
<p>was like three or four interventions.</p>
<p>Anytime the road would do anything geometrically</p>
<p>or turn too much, it would just like not work.</p>
<p>And so going from that</p>
<p>to like a pretty competent system in five years</p>
<p>and seeing what happens also under the hood</p>
<p>and what the scale of which the team is operating now</p>
<p>with respect to data and compute and everything else</p>
<p>is just a massive progress.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re climbing a mountain and it&rsquo;s fog,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re making a lot of progress.</p>
<p>Fog, you&rsquo;re making progress</p>
<p>and you see what the next directions are.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re looking at some of the remaining challenges</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not like, they&rsquo;re not perturbing you</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not changing your philosophy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not contorting yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, actually,</p>
<p>these are the things that we still need to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fundamental components of solving the problem</p>
<p>seem to be there from the data engine to the compute,</p>
<p>to the compute on the car, to the compute for the training,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done, over the years you&rsquo;ve been at Tesla,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done a lot of amazing breakthrough ideas</p>
<p>and engineering, all of it,</p>
<p>from the data engine to the human side, all of it.</p>
<p>Can you speak to why you chose to leave Tesla?</p>
<p>Basically, as I described, I ran,</p>
<p>I think over time during those five years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of gotten myself</p>
<p>into a little bit of a managerial position.</p>
<p>Most of my days were meetings and growing the organization</p>
<p>and making decisions about sort of high-level</p>
<p>strategic decisions about the team</p>
<p>and what it should be working on and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like a corporate executive role</p>
<p>and I can do it.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m okay at it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like fundamentally what I enjoy.</p>
<p>And so I think when I joined,</p>
<p>there was no computer vision team</p>
<p>because Tesla was just going from the transition</p>
<p>of using Mobileye, a third-party vendor</p>
<p>for all of its computer vision,</p>
<p>to having to build its computer vision system.</p>
<p>So when I showed up,</p>
<p>there were two people training deep neural networks</p>
<p>and they were training them at a computer</p>
<p>at their legs, like down, it was a workstation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing some kind of basic classification task.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so I kind of like grew that</p>
<p>into what I think is a fairly respectable</p>
<p>deep learning team, a massive compute cluster,</p>
<p>a very good data annotation organization.</p>
<p>And I was very happy with where that was.</p>
<p>It became quite autonomous.</p>
<p>And so I kind of stepped away and I, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to do much more technical things again.</p>
<p>Yeah, and kind of like refocus on AGI.</p>
<p>What was this soul-searching like?</p>
<p>Cause you took a little time off and think,</p>
<p>like what, how many mushrooms did you take?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I mean, what was going through your mind?</p>
<p>The human lifetime is finite.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You did a few incredible things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the best teachers of AI in the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the best, and I don&rsquo;t mean that,</p>
<p>I mean that in the best possible way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the best tinkerers in the AI world,</p>
<p>meaning like understanding the fundamentals</p>
<p>of how something works by building it from scratch</p>
<p>and playing with the basic intuitions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Einstein, Feynman were all really good</p>
<p>at this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like small example of a thing to play with it,</p>
<p>to try to understand it.</p>
<p>And obviously now with Tesla,</p>
<p>you help build a team of machine learning,</p>
<p>like engineers and assistant</p>
<p>that actually accomplishes something in the real world.</p>
<p>So given all that, like what was the soul-searching like?</p>
<p>Well, it was hard because obviously I love the company a lot</p>
<p>and I love Elon, I love Tesla.</p>
<p>I want, so it was hard to leave.</p>
<p>I love the team, basically.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think I actually,</p>
<p>I would be potentially like interested in revisiting it,</p>
<p>maybe coming back at some point,</p>
<p>working in Optimus, working in AGI at Tesla.</p>
<p>I think Tesla is going to do incredible things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a massive large-scale robotics kind of company</p>
<p>with a ton of in-house talent</p>
<p>for doing really incredible things.</p>
<p>And I think human robots are going to be amazing.</p>
<p>I think autonomous transportation is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>All this is happening at Tesla.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just a really amazing organization.</p>
<p>So being part of it and helping it along,</p>
<p>I think was very, basically I enjoyed that a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was basically difficult for those reasons</p>
<p>because I love the company,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m happy to potentially at some point</p>
<p>come back for Act Two,</p>
<p>but I felt like at this stage, I built the team,</p>
<p>it felt autonomous, and I became a manager</p>
<p>and I wanted to do a lot more technical stuff.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn stuff, I wanted to teach stuff.</p>
<p>And I just kind of felt like it was a good time</p>
<p>for a change of pace a little bit.</p>
<p>What do you think is the best movie sequel of all time,</p>
<p>speaking of Part Two?</p>
<p>Because most of them suck.</p>
<p>Movie sequels?</p>
<p>Movie sequels, yeah.</p>
<p>And you tweet about movies, so this is a tiny tangent.</p>
<p>Is there a, what&rsquo;s your,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s like a favorite movie sequel?</p>
<p>Godfather Part Two?</p>
<p>Are you a fan of Godfather?</p>
<p>Because you didn&rsquo;t even tweet or mention the Godfather.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t love that movie.</p>
<p>I know it has a huge follow-up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to edit that out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to edit out the hate towards the Godfather.</p>
<p>How dare you disrespect?</p>
<p>I think I will make a strong statement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>but I basically don&rsquo;t like any movie before 1995.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you mention Terminator Two?</p>
<p>Okay, okay, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Terminator Two was a little bit later, 1990.</p>
<p>No, I think Terminator Two was in the 80s.</p>
<p>And I like Terminator One as well.</p>
<p>So, okay, so like few exceptions,</p>
<p>but by and large, for some reason,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like movies before 1995 or something.</p>
<p>They feel very slow.</p>
<p>The camera is like zoomed out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of naive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>And also, Terminator was very much ahead of its time.</p>
<p>Yes, and the Godfather, there&rsquo;s like no AGI, so.</p>
<p>I mean, but you have Good Will Hunting</p>
<p>was one of the movies you mentioned,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t have any AGI either.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s mathematics.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess occasionally I do enjoy movies</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t feature.</p>
<p>Or like Anchorman, that has no, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Anchorman is so good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand, speaking of AGI,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t understand why Will Ferrell is so funny.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t compute.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just something about him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a singular human,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t get that many comedies these days.</p>
<p>And I wonder if it has to do about the culture</p>
<p>or like the machine of Hollywood,</p>
<p>or does it have to do with just we got lucky</p>
<p>with certain people in comedy that came together,</p>
<p>because he is a singular human.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like his movies.</p>
<p>That was a ridiculous tangent, I apologize.</p>
<p>But you mentioned humanoid robots.</p>
<p>So what do you think about Optimus, about TeslaBot?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll have robots in the factory</p>
<p>and in the home in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a very hard project.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to take a while,</p>
<p>but who else is going to build human robots at scale?</p>
<p>And I think it is a very good form factor to go after,</p>
<p>because like I mentioned,</p>
<p>the world is designed for humanoid form factor.</p>
<p>These things would be able to operate our machines.</p>
<p>They would be able to sit down in chairs,</p>
<p>potentially even drive cars.</p>
<p>Basically the world is designed for humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the form factor you want to invest into</p>
<p>and make work over time.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another school of thought, which is,</p>
<p>okay, pick a problem and design a robot to it.</p>
<p>But actually designing a robot</p>
<p>and getting a whole data engine</p>
<p>and everything behind it to work</p>
<p>is actually an incredibly hard problem.</p>
<p>So it makes sense to go after general interfaces</p>
<p>that, okay, they are not perfect for any one given task,</p>
<p>but they actually have the generality</p>
<p>of just with a prompt with English,</p>
<p>able to do something across.</p>
<p>And so I think it makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>to go after a general interface in the physical world.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a very difficult project.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to take time.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen no other company</p>
<p>that can execute on that vision.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be amazing.</p>
<p>Like basically physical labor.</p>
<p>Like if you think transportation is a large market,</p>
<p>try physical labor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like insane.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just physical labor.</p>
<p>To me, the thing that&rsquo;s also exciting is social robotics.</p>
<p>So the relationship we&rsquo;ll have on different levels</p>
<p>with those robots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was really excited to see Optimus.</p>
<p>Like people have criticized me for the excitement.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of research labs</p>
<p>that do humanoid legged robots,</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics, Unitree,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of companies that do legged robots.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the elegance of the movement</p>
<p>is a tiny, tiny part of the big picture.</p>
<p>So integrating, the two big exciting things to me</p>
<p>about Tesla doing humanoid or any legged robots</p>
<p>is clearly integrating into the data engine.</p>
<p>So the data engine aspect.</p>
<p>So the actual intelligence for the perception</p>
<p>and the control and the planning</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>integrating into the fleet that you mentioned, right?</p>
<p>And then speaking of fleet,</p>
<p>the second thing is the mass manufacturers.</p>
<p>Just knowing culturally driving towards a simple robot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cheap to produce at scale.</p>
<p>And doing that well, having experience to do that well,</p>
<p>that changes everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s a very different culture</p>
<p>and style than Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>Who, by the way, those robots are just,</p>
<p>the way they move, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a very long time before Tesla</p>
<p>can achieve the smoothness of movement.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the entirety of the system,</p>
<p>like we talked about the data engine and the fleet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>Even the initial sort of models.</p>
<p>But that too was really surprising,</p>
<p>that in a few months you can get a prototype.</p>
<p>Yep, and the reason that happened very quickly is,</p>
<p>as you alluded to, there&rsquo;s a ton of copy paste</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s happening on the autopilot, a lot.</p>
<p>The amount of expertise that came out of the woodworks</p>
<p>at Tesla for building the human robot was incredible to see.</p>
<p>Basically, Elon said, at one point, we&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>And then next day, basically,</p>
<p>all these CAD models started to appear.</p>
<p>And people talking about the supply chain and manufacturing.</p>
<p>And people showed up with screwdrivers and everything</p>
<p>the other day and started to put together the body.</p>
<p>And I was like, whoa, all these people exist at Tesla.</p>
<p>And fundamentally, building a car is actually</p>
<p>not that different from building a robot.</p>
<p>And that is true, not just for the hardware pieces.</p>
<p>And also, let&rsquo;s not forget hardware, not just for a demo,</p>
<p>but manufacturing of that hardware at scale</p>
<p>is a whole different thing.</p>
<p>But for software as well, basically,</p>
<p>this robot currently thinks it&rsquo;s a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to have a midlife crisis at some point.</p>
<p>It thinks it&rsquo;s a car.</p>
<p>Some of the earlier demos, actually,</p>
<p>we were talking about potentially doing them</p>
<p>outside in the parking lot,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where all of the computer vision</p>
<p>was working out of the box instead of inside.</p>
<p>But all the operating system, everything just copy pastes.</p>
<p>Computer vision, mostly copy pastes.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to retrain the neural nets,</p>
<p>but the approach and everything and data engine</p>
<p>and offline trackers and the way we go</p>
<p>about the occupancy tracker and so on, everything copy pastes.</p>
<p>You just need to retrain the neural nets.</p>
<p>And then the planning control, of course,</p>
<p>has to change quite a bit.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a ton of copy paste</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s happening at Tesla.</p>
<p>And so if you were to go with the goal of like,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s build a million human robots</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not Tesla, that&rsquo;s a lot to ask.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Tesla, it&rsquo;s actually like, it&rsquo;s not that crazy.</p>
<p>And then the follow up question is then how difficult,</p>
<p>just like with driving,</p>
<p>how difficult is the manipulation task?</p>
<p>Such that it can have an impact at scale.</p>
<p>I think, depending on the context,</p>
<p>the really nice thing about robotics is that,</p>
<p>unless you do a manufacturer and that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>is there is more room for error.</p>
<p>Driving is so safety critical and also time critical.</p>
<p>Like a robot is allowed to move slower, which is nice.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to take a long time,</p>
<p>but the way you want to structure the development</p>
<p>is you need to say, okay, it&rsquo;s going to take a long time.</p>
<p>How can I set up the product development roadmap</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;m making revenue along the way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not setting myself up for a zero one loss function</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t work until it works.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be in that position.</p>
<p>You want to make it useful almost immediately.</p>
<p>And then you want to slowly deploy it and-</p>
<p>At scale, hopefully.</p>
<p>At scale.</p>
<p>And you want to set up your data engine,</p>
<p>your improvement loops, the telemetry, the evaluation,</p>
<p>the harness and everything.</p>
<p>And you want to improve the product over time incrementally</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making revenue along the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extremely important</p>
<p>because otherwise you cannot build these large undertakings</p>
<p>just like don&rsquo;t make sense economically.</p>
<p>And also from the point of view of the team working on it,</p>
<p>they need the dopamine along the way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just going to make a promise</p>
<p>about this being useful.</p>
<p>This is going to change the world in 10 years when it works.</p>
<p>This is not where you want to be.</p>
<p>You want to be in a place like I think Autopilot is today</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s offering increased safety</p>
<p>and convenience of driving today.</p>
<p>People pay for it.</p>
<p>People like it.</p>
<p>People purchase it.</p>
<p>And then you also have the greater mission</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working towards.</p>
<p>And you see that.</p>
<p>So the dopamine for the team,</p>
<p>that was a source of happiness.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re deploying this.</p>
<p>People like it.</p>
<p>People drive it.</p>
<p>People pay for it.</p>
<p>They care about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Your grandma drives it.</p>
<p>She gives you feedback.</p>
<p>People like it.</p>
<p>People engage with it.</p>
<p>You engage with it.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>People that drive Teslas recognize you and give you love.</p>
<p>Like, hey, thanks for this nice feature that it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the tricky thing is</p>
<p>some people really love you.</p>
<p>Some people, unfortunately,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working on something that you think</p>
<p>is extremely valuable, useful, et cetera.</p>
<p>Some people do hate you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people who hate me and the team</p>
<p>and the whole project.</p>
<p>And I think-</p>
<p>Are they Tesla drivers?</p>
<p>Many cases they&rsquo;re not, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, that actually makes me sad about humans</p>
<p>or the current ways that humans interact.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually fixable.</p>
<p>I think humans want to be good to each other.</p>
<p>I think Twitter and social media is part of the mechanism</p>
<p>that actually somehow makes the negativity more viral,</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t deserve, like,</p>
<p>disproportionately add a viral boost to the negativity.</p>
<p>But I wish people would just get excited about,</p>
<p>so suppress some of the jealousy,</p>
<p>some of the ego, and just get excited for others.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a karma aspect to that.</p>
<p>You get excited for others, they&rsquo;ll get excited for you.</p>
<p>Same thing in academia.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not careful,</p>
<p>there is like a dynamical system there.</p>
<p>If you think of in silos and get jealous</p>
<p>of somebody else being successful,</p>
<p>that actually, perhaps counterintuitively,</p>
<p>leads to less productivity of you as a community</p>
<p>and you individually.</p>
<p>I feel like if you keep celebrating others,</p>
<p>that actually makes you more successful.</p>
<p>I think people, depending on the industry,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t quite learned that yet.</p>
<p>Some people are also very negative and very vocal,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re very prominently featured.</p>
<p>But actually, there&rsquo;s a ton of people who are cheerleaders,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re silent cheerleaders.</p>
<p>And when you talk to people just in the world,</p>
<p>they will tell you, oh, it&rsquo;s amazing, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Especially people who understand how difficult it is</p>
<p>to get this stuff working.</p>
<p>Like people who have built products,</p>
<p>makers, entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Like making this work and changing something</p>
<p>is incredibly hard.</p>
<p>Those people are more likely to cheerlead you.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that makes me sad</p>
<p>is some folks in the robotics community</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do the cheerleading and they should.</p>
<p>Because they know how difficult it is.</p>
<p>Well, they actually sometimes don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how difficult it is to create a product at scale, right?</p>
<p>To actually deploy it in the real world.</p>
<p>A lot of the development of robots and AI systems</p>
<p>is done on very specific small benchmarks.</p>
<p>And as opposed to real world conditions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s really hard to work on robotics</p>
<p>in an academic setting.</p>
<p>Or AI systems that apply in the real world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve criticized, you flourished and loved for a time</p>
<p>the ImageNet, the famed ImageNet dataset.</p>
<p>And have recently had some words of criticism</p>
<p>that the academic research ML community</p>
<p>gives a little too much love still to the ImageNet</p>
<p>or like those kinds of benchmarks.</p>
<p>Can you speak to the strengths and weaknesses of datasets</p>
<p>used in machine learning research?</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t know that I recall the specific instance</p>
<p>where I was unhappy or criticizing ImageNet.</p>
<p>I think ImageNet has been extremely valuable.</p>
<p>It was basically a benchmark that allowed</p>
<p>the deep learning community to demonstrate</p>
<p>that deep neural networks actually work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a massive value in that.</p>
<p>So I think ImageNet was useful,</p>
<p>but basically it&rsquo;s become a bit of an MNIST at this point.</p>
<p>So MNIST is like little two 28 by 28 grayscale digits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of a joke dataset that everyone just crushes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still papers written on MNIST though, right?</p>
<p>Maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like strong papers.</p>
<p>Like papers that focus on like,</p>
<p>how do we learn with a small amount of data,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could see that being helpful,</p>
<p>but not in sort of like mainline</p>
<p>computer vision research anymore, of course.</p>
<p>I think the way I&rsquo;ve heard you somewhere,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m just imagining things,</p>
<p>but I think you said like ImageNet was a huge contribution</p>
<p>to the community for a long time</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s time to move past those kinds of-</p>
<p>Well, ImageNet has been crushed.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the error rates are&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re getting like 90% accuracy</p>
<p>in 1000 classification way prediction.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen those images and it&rsquo;s like really high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly,</p>
<p>the top five error rate is now like 1% or something.</p>
<p>Given your experience with a gigantic real world dataset,</p>
<p>would you like to see benchmarks</p>
<p>move in a certain directions</p>
<p>that the research community uses?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think academics</p>
<p>currently have the next ImageNet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve obviously, I think we&rsquo;ve crushed MNIST.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve basically kind of crushed ImageNet</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no next sort of big benchmark</p>
<p>that the entire community rallies behind</p>
<p>and uses for further development of these networks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder what it takes for a dataset</p>
<p>to captivate the imagination of everybody,</p>
<p>like where they all get behind it.</p>
<p>That could also need like a leader, right?</p>
<p>Somebody with popularity.</p>
<p>Yeah, why did ImageNet take off?</p>
<p>Or is it just the accident of history?</p>
<p>It was the right amount of difficult.</p>
<p>It was the right amount of difficult</p>
<p>and simple and interesting enough.</p>
<p>It just kind of like,</p>
<p>it was the right time for that kind of a dataset.</p>
<p>Question from Reddit.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the role</p>
<p>that synthetic data and game engines</p>
<p>will play in the future of neural net model development?</p>
<p>I think as neural nets converge to humans,</p>
<p>the value of simulation to neural nets</p>
<p>will be similar to value of simulation to humans.</p>
<p>So people use simulation for,</p>
<p>people use simulation because they can learn something</p>
<p>in that kind of a system</p>
<p>and without having to actually experience it.</p>
<p>But are you referring to the simulation</p>
<p>we do in our head?</p>
<p>Is that what-</p>
<p>No, sorry, simulation, I mean like video games</p>
<p>or other forms of simulation for various professionals.</p>
<p>So let me push back on that</p>
<p>because maybe there&rsquo;s simulation that we do in our heads.</p>
<p>Like simulate, if I do this,</p>
<p>what do I think will happen?</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s like internal simulation.</p>
<p>Yeah, internal.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Assuming before we act?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, but that&rsquo;s independent</p>
<p>from like the use of simulation</p>
<p>in the sense of like computer games</p>
<p>or using simulation for training set creation or-</p>
<p>Is it independent or is it just loosely correlated?</p>
<p>Because like, isn&rsquo;t that useful to do like</p>
<p>counterfactual or like edge case simulation</p>
<p>to like, you know, what happens if there&rsquo;s a nuclear war?</p>
<p>What happens if there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>like those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a different simulation from like Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I interpreted the question.</p>
<p>Ah, so like simulation of the average case.</p>
<p>Is that, what&rsquo;s Unreal Engine?</p>
<p>What do you mean by Unreal Engine?</p>
<p>So simulating a world, the physics of that world,</p>
<p>why is that different?</p>
<p>Like, because you also can add behavior to that world</p>
<p>and you could try all kinds of stuff, right?</p>
<p>You could throw all kinds of weird things into it.</p>
<p>So Unreal Engine is not just about simulating,</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it is about simulating</p>
<p>the physics of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also doing something with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the graphics, the physics,</p>
<p>and the agents that you put into the environment</p>
<p>and stuff like that, yeah.</p>
<p>See, I think you, I feel like you said</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not that important, I guess,</p>
<p>for the future of AI development.</p>
<p>Is that correct to interpret it that way?</p>
<p>I think humans use simulators for,</p>
<p>humans use simulators and they find them useful.</p>
<p>And so computers will use simulators and find them useful.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use simulators very often.</p>
<p>I play a video game every once in a while,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I derive any wisdom</p>
<p>about my own existence from those video games.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a momentary escape from reality</p>
<p>versus a source of wisdom about reality.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, so I think that&rsquo;s a very polite way</p>
<p>of saying simulation is not that useful.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as like a fundamental,</p>
<p>really important part of like training neural nets currently.</p>
<p>But I think as neural nets become more and more powerful,</p>
<p>I think you will need fewer examples</p>
<p>to train additional behaviors.</p>
<p>And simulation is, of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a domain gap in a simulation</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not the real world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s slightly something different.</p>
<p>But with a powerful enough neural net,</p>
<p>you need, the domain gap can be bigger, I think,</p>
<p>because neural net will sort of understand</p>
<p>that even though it&rsquo;s not the real world,</p>
<p>it like has all this high level structure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m supposed to be able to learn from.</p>
<p>So the neural net will actually,</p>
<p>yeah, it will be able to leverage the synthetic data better</p>
<p>by closing the gap,</p>
<p>but understanding in which ways this is not real data.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Ready to do better questions next time.</p>
<p>That was a question, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So is it possible, do you think, speaking of MNIST,</p>
<p>to construct neural nets and training processes</p>
<p>that require very little data?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been talking about huge data sets</p>
<p>like the Internet for training.</p>
<p>I mean, one way to say that is like you said,</p>
<p>like the querying itself is another level of training,</p>
<p>I guess, and that requires a little data.</p>
<p>But do you see any value in doing research</p>
<p>and kind of going down the direction of,</p>
<p>can we use very little data to train,</p>
<p>to construct a knowledge base?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>I just think like at some point you need a massive data set.</p>
<p>And then when you pre-train your massive neural net</p>
<p>and get something that is like a GPT or something,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re able to be very efficient at training</p>
<p>any arbitrary new task.</p>
<p>So a lot of these GPTs, you can do tasks</p>
<p>like sentiment analysis or translation or so on</p>
<p>just by being prompted with very few examples.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the kind of thing I want you to do.</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s an input sentence,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the translation into German.</p>
<p>Input sentence, translation to German.</p>
<p>Input sentence, blank,</p>
<p>and the neural net will complete the translation to German</p>
<p>just by looking at sort of the example you&rsquo;ve provided.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an example of a very few-shot learning</p>
<p>in the activations of the neural net</p>
<p>instead of the weights of the neural net.</p>
<p>And so I think basically just like humans,</p>
<p>neural nets will become very data efficient</p>
<p>at learning any other new task.</p>
<p>But at some point you need a massive data set</p>
<p>to pre-train your network.</p>
<p>Do you get that?</p>
<p>And probably we humans have something like that.</p>
<p>Do we have something like that?</p>
<p>Do we have a passive, in the background,</p>
<p>background model constructing thing</p>
<p>that just runs all the time in a self-supervised way?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not conscious of it?</p>
<p>I think humans definitely.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously we learn a lot during our lifespan,</p>
<p>but also we have a ton of hardware</p>
<p>that helps us at initialization,</p>
<p>coming from sort of evolution.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s also a really big component.</p>
<p>A lot of people in the field,</p>
<p>I think they just talk about the amounts of like seconds</p>
<p>and that a person has lived</p>
<p>pretending that this is a tabula rasa,</p>
<p>sort of like a zero initialization of a neural net.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You can look at a lot of animals,</p>
<p>like for example, zebras.</p>
<p>Zebras get born and they see and they can run.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s zero training data in their lifespan.</p>
<p>They can just do that.</p>
<p>So somehow, I have no idea how evolution has found a way</p>
<p>to encode these algorithms</p>
<p>and these neural net initializations</p>
<p>that are extremely good into ATCGs.</p>
<p>And I have no idea how this works,</p>
<p>but apparently it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s a proof by existence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something magical about going from a single cell</p>
<p>to an organism that is born to the first few years of life.</p>
<p>I kind of like the idea</p>
<p>that the reason we don&rsquo;t remember anything</p>
<p>about the first few years of our life</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a really painful process.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a very difficult, challenging training process.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like intellectually, like,</p>
<p>and maybe, yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we remember any of that?</p>
<p>There might be some crazy training going on</p>
<p>and maybe that&rsquo;s the background model training</p>
<p>that is very painful.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s best for the system once it&rsquo;s trained</p>
<p>not to remember how it&rsquo;s constructed.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just like the hardware for long-term memory</p>
<p>is just not fully developed.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like the first few years of infants</p>
<p>is not actually like learning, it&rsquo;s brain maturing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re born premature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a theory along those lines</p>
<p>because of the birth canal and the swelling of the brain.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re born premature</p>
<p>and then the first few years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just, the brain&rsquo;s maturing.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some learning eventually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my current view on it.</p>
<p>What do you think,</p>
<p>do you think neural nets can have long-term memory?</p>
<p>Like that approach is something like humans.</p>
<p>Do you think there needs to be another meta architecture</p>
<p>on top of it to add something like a knowledge base</p>
<p>that learns facts about the world</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yes, but I don&rsquo;t know to what extent</p>
<p>it will be explicitly constructed.</p>
<p>It might take unintuitive forms</p>
<p>where you are telling the GPT like,</p>
<p>hey, you have a declarative memory bank</p>
<p>to which you can store and retrieve data from.</p>
<p>And whenever you encounter some information</p>
<p>that you find useful, just save it to your memory bank.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s an example of something you have retrieved</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how you say it,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how you load from it.</p>
<p>You just say, load, whatever,</p>
<p>you teach it in text in English.</p>
<p>And then it might learn to use a memory bank from that.</p>
<p>Oh, so the neural net is the architecture</p>
<p>for the background model, the base thing.</p>
<p>And then everything else is just on top of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty easy too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just text, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving it gadgets and gizmos.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re teaching some kind of a special language</p>
<p>by which it can save arbitrary information</p>
<p>and retrieve it at a later time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re telling it about these special tokens</p>
<p>and how to arrange them to use these interfaces.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, you can use a calculator.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you use it.</p>
<p>Just do five, three plus four, one equals.</p>
<p>And when equals is there,</p>
<p>a calculator will actually read out the answer</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to calculate it yourself.</p>
<p>And you just like tell it in English,</p>
<p>this might actually work.</p>
<p>Do you think in that sense, Gato is interesting,</p>
<p>the DeepMind system that it&rsquo;s not just doing language,</p>
<p>but actually throws it all in the same pile,</p>
<p>images, actions, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what we&rsquo;re moving towards.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>So Gato is very much a kitchen sink approach</p>
<p>to like reinforcement learning</p>
<p>in lots of different environments</p>
<p>with a single fixed transformer model, right?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very sort of early result</p>
<p>in that realm.</p>
<p>But I think, yeah, it&rsquo;s along the lines</p>
<p>of what I think things will eventually look like.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this is the early days of a system</p>
<p>that eventually will look like this,</p>
<p>like from a reach certain perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not super huge fan</p>
<p>of I think all these interfaces</p>
<p>that like look very different.</p>
<p>I would want everything to be normalized into the same API.</p>
<p>So for example, screen pixels, very same API.</p>
<p>Instead of having like different world environments</p>
<p>that have very different physics</p>
<p>and joint configurations and appearances and whatever,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having some kind of special tokens</p>
<p>for different games that you can plug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather just normalize everything to a single interface.</p>
<p>So it looks the same to the neural net,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all gonna be pixel-based pong in the end.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about your own personal life.</p>
<p>A lot of people wanna know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the most productive and brilliant people</p>
<p>in the history of AI.</p>
<p>What is a productive day</p>
<p>in the life of Andrej Karpathy look like?</p>
<p>What time do you wake up?</p>
<p>Because imagine some kind of dance</p>
<p>between the average productive day</p>
<p>and a perfect productive day.</p>
<p>So the perfect productive day is the thing we strive towards</p>
<p>and the average is kind of what it kind of converges to,</p>
<p>given all the mistakes and human eventualities and so on.</p>
<p>So what time do you wake up?</p>
<p>Are you a morning person?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a morning person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a night owl for sure.</p>
<p>Is it stable or not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s semi-stable, like eight or nine or something like that.</p>
<p>During my PhD, it was even later.</p>
<p>I used to go to sleep usually at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>I think the a.m. hours are precious</p>
<p>and very interesting time to work</p>
<p>because everyone is asleep.</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. or 7 a.m., the East Coast is awake.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s already activity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s already some text messages, whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff happening.</p>
<p>You can go on like some news website</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s stuff happening and distracting.</p>
<p>At 3 a.m., everything is totally quiet.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not gonna be bothered</p>
<p>and you have solid chunks of time to do work.</p>
<p>So I like those periods.</p>
<p>Night owl by default.</p>
<p>And then I think like productive time basically.</p>
<p>What I like to do is you need to build some momentum</p>
<p>on a problem without too much distraction.</p>
<p>And you need to load your RAM,</p>
<p>your working memory with that problem.</p>
<p>And then you need to be obsessed with it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re taking shower, when you&rsquo;re falling asleep.</p>
<p>You need to be obsessed with the problem</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fully in your memory</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re ready to wake up and work on it right there.</p>
<p>So it is the scale of,</p>
<p>is this in a scale, temporal scale of a single day</p>
<p>or a couple of days, a week, a month?</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t talk about one day basically in isolation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a whole process.</p>
<p>When I wanna get productive in the problem,</p>
<p>I feel like I need a span of a few days</p>
<p>where I can really get in on that problem.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna be interrupted</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to just be completely obsessed</p>
<p>with that problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I do most of my good work, I would say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a bunch of cool little projects</p>
<p>in a very short amount of time, very quickly.</p>
<p>So that requires you just focusing on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically I need to load my working memory</p>
<p>with the problem and I need to be productive</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always a huge fixed cost</p>
<p>to approaching any problem.</p>
<p>I was struggling with this, for example, at Tesla</p>
<p>because I want to work on a small side project,</p>
<p>but okay, you first need to figure out,</p>
<p>oh, okay, I need to SSH into my cluster.</p>
<p>I need to bring up a VS Code editor</p>
<p>so I can work on this.</p>
<p>I need to, I ran into some stupid error</p>
<p>because of some reason.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not at a point</p>
<p>where you can be just productive right away.</p>
<p>You are facing barriers.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s about really removing all of that barrier</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to go into the problem</p>
<p>and you have the full problem loaded in your memory.</p>
<p>And somehow avoiding distractions of all different forms</p>
<p>like news stories, emails, but also distractions</p>
<p>from other interesting projects</p>
<p>that you previously worked on</p>
<p>or currently working on and so on.</p>
<p>You just want to really focus your mind.</p>
<p>And I mean, I can take some time off for distractions</p>
<p>and in between, but I think it can&rsquo;t be too much.</p>
<p>Most of your day is sort of like spent on that problem.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I drink coffee.</p>
<p>I have my morning routine.</p>
<p>I look at some news, Twitter, Hacker News,</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So basically you wake up, you have some coffee.</p>
<p>Are you trying to get to work as quickly as possible?</p>
<p>Or do you take in this diet</p>
<p>of like what the hell is happening in the world first?</p>
<p>I am, I do find it interesting to know about the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s useful or good</p>
<p>but it is part of my routine right now.</p>
<p>So I do read through a bunch of news articles</p>
<p>and I want to be informed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m suspicious of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suspicious of the practice</p>
<p>but currently that&rsquo;s where I am.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean suspicious about the positive effect</p>
<p>of that practice on your productivity</p>
<p>and your well-being as well?</p>
<p>My well-being psychologically, yeah.</p>
<p>And also on your ability to deeply understand the world</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a bunch of sources of information.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really focused on deeply integrating it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little distracting.</p>
<p>In terms of a perfectly productive day</p>
<p>for how long of a stretch of time</p>
<p>in one session do you try to work and focus on a thing?</p>
<p>Is it a couple hours?</p>
<p>Is it one hour?</p>
<p>Is it 30 minutes?</p>
<p>Is it 10 minutes?</p>
<p>I can probably go like a small few hours</p>
<p>and then I need some breaks in between</p>
<p>for like food and stuff.</p>
<p>And yeah, but I think like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still really hard to accumulate hours.</p>
<p>I was using a tracker that told me exactly</p>
<p>how much time I spent coding any one day.</p>
<p>And even on a very productive day</p>
<p>I still spent only like six or eight hours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just because there&rsquo;s so much padding,</p>
<p>commute, talking to people, food, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like the cost of life,</p>
<p>just living and sustaining and homeostasis</p>
<p>and just maintaining yourself as a human is very high.</p>
<p>And that there seems to be a desire</p>
<p>within the human mind to participate in society</p>
<p>that creates that padding.</p>
<p>Because the most productive days I&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>is just completely from start to finish</p>
<p>just tuning out everything and just sitting there.</p>
<p>And then you could do more than six and eight hours.</p>
<p>Is there some wisdom about what gives you strength</p>
<p>to do like tough days of long focus?</p>
<p>Yeah, just like whenever I get obsessed about a problem</p>
<p>something just needs to work, something just needs to exist.</p>
<p>It needs to exist.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to deal with bugs and programming issues</p>
<p>and technical issues and design decisions</p>
<p>that turn out to be the wrong ones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to think through all of that</p>
<p>given that you want a thing to exist.</p>
<p>Yeah, it needs to exist.</p>
<p>And then I think to me also a big factor is</p>
<p>are other humans are going to appreciate it?</p>
<p>Are they going to like it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of my motivation.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m helping humans and they seem happy,</p>
<p>they say nice things, they tweet about it or whatever,</p>
<p>that gives me pleasure because I&rsquo;m doing something useful.</p>
<p>So like you do see yourself sharing it with the world,</p>
<p>like whether it&rsquo;s on GitHub or through blog posts</p>
<p>or through videos.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking about it.</p>
<p>Like suppose I did all these things but did not share them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would have the same amount of motivation</p>
<p>that I can build up.</p>
<p>You enjoy the feeling of other people gaining value</p>
<p>and happiness from the stuff you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about diet?</p>
<p>Is there, I saw you played with intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>Do you fast?</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>
<p>I play with everything.</p>
<p>You play with everything.</p>
<p>Well, the things you play, what&rsquo;s been most beneficial</p>
<p>to your ability to mentally focus on a thing?</p>
<p>And just mental productivity and happiness.</p>
<p>You still fast?</p>
<p>Yeah, I still fast, but I do intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>But really what it means at the end of the day</p>
<p>is I skip breakfast.</p>
<p>So I do 18, six roughly by default</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m in my steady state.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m traveling or doing something else,</p>
<p>I will break the rules.</p>
<p>But in my steady state, I do 18, six.</p>
<p>So I eat only from 12 to six.</p>
<p>Not a hard rule and I break it often,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my default.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of random experiments.</p>
<p>For the most part right now,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve been for the last year and a half, I wanna say,</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m plant-based or plant-forward.</p>
<p>I heard plant-forward.</p>
<p>It sounds better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know what the difference is,</p>
<p>but it sounds better in my mind.</p>
<p>But it just means that I prefer plant-based food.</p>
<p>Raw or cooked or?</p>
<p>I prefer cooked and plant-based.</p>
<p>So plant-based, forgive me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know how wide the category of plant entails.</p>
<p>Well, plant-based just means</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not malicious about it and you can flex.</p>
<p>And you just prefer to eat plants.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not making,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not trying to influence other people.</p>
<p>And if someone is, you come to someone&rsquo;s house party</p>
<p>and they serve you a steak that they&rsquo;re really proud of,</p>
<p>you will eat it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right, so you&rsquo;re not judgmental.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the flip side of that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very sort of flexible.</p>
<p>Have you tried doing one meal a day?</p>
<p>I have, accidentally, not consistently.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve accidentally had that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I think it makes me feel not good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much of a hit.</p>
<p>And so currently I have about two meals a day, 12 and six.</p>
<p>I do that nonstop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it now.</p>
<p>I do it one meal a day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting feeling.</p>
<p>Have you ever fasted longer than a day?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of water fasts</p>
<p>because I was curious what happens.</p>
<p>Anything interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re hungry for two days</p>
<p>and then starting day three or so, you&rsquo;re not hungry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like such a weird feeling</p>
<p>because you haven&rsquo;t eaten in a few days</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not hungry.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that weird?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>One of the many weird things about human biology</p>
<p>is figure something out.</p>
<p>It finds another source of energy or something like that</p>
<p>or relaxes the system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works.</p>
<p>Yeah, the body is like, you&rsquo;re hungry, you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>And then it just gives up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I guess we&rsquo;re fasting now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>And then it just kind of like focuses</p>
<p>on trying to make you not hungry</p>
<p>and not feel the damage of that</p>
<p>and trying to give you some space</p>
<p>to figure out the food situation.</p>
<p>So are you still to this day most productive at night?</p>
<p>I would say I am,</p>
<p>but it is really hard to maintain my PhD schedule,</p>
<p>especially when I was, say, working at Tesla and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a non-starter.</p>
<p>So, but even now, like, you know,</p>
<p>people want to meet for various events.</p>
<p>Society lives in a certain period of time</p>
<p>and you sort of have to, like, work with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to, like, do a social thing</p>
<p>and then after that return and do work.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just really hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I try, when I do social things,</p>
<p>I try not to do too much drinking</p>
<p>so I can return and continue doing work.</p>
<p>But at Tesla, is there conversions?</p>
<p>Tesla, but any company.</p>
<p>Is there a convergence towards the schedule</p>
<p>or is there more, is that how humans behave</p>
<p>when they collaborate?</p>
<p>I need to learn about this.</p>
<p>Do they try to keep a consistent schedule</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re all awake at the same time?</p>
<p>I mean, I do try to create a routine</p>
<p>and I try to create a steady state</p>
<p>in which I&rsquo;m comfortable in.</p>
<p>So I have a morning routine, I have a day routine.</p>
<p>I try to keep things to a steady state</p>
<p>and things are predictable</p>
<p>and then you can sort of just, like,</p>
<p>your body just sort of, like, sticks to that.</p>
<p>And if you try to stress that a little too much,</p>
<p>it will create, you know,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re traveling and you&rsquo;re dealing with jet lag,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not able to really ascend to, you know,</p>
<p>where you need to go.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s weird too about humans</p>
<p>with the habits and stuff.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on work-life balance</p>
<p>throughout a human lifetime?</p>
<p>So Tesla, in part, was known for sort of</p>
<p>pushing people to their limits</p>
<p>in terms of what they&rsquo;re able to do,</p>
<p>in terms of what they&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>in terms of how much they work, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I will say Tesla gets all too much</p>
<p>bad rep for this because what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>Tesla, it&rsquo;s a bursty environment.</p>
<p>So I would say the baseline,</p>
<p>my only point of reference is Google,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve interned three times</p>
<p>and I saw what it&rsquo;s like inside Google and DeepMind.</p>
<p>I would say the baseline is higher than that,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a punctuated equilibrium</p>
<p>where once in a while there&rsquo;s a fire</p>
<p>and people work really hard.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s spiky and bursty</p>
<p>and then all the stories get collected.</p>
<p>About the bursts, yeah.</p>
<p>And then it gives the appearance of like total insanity,</p>
<p>but actually it&rsquo;s just a bit more intense environment</p>
<p>and there are fires and sprints.</p>
<p>And so I think, definitely though,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s a more intense environment</p>
<p>than something you would get at Google.</p>
<p>But in your personal, forget all of that,</p>
<p>just in your own personal life,</p>
<p>what do you think about the happiness of a human being,</p>
<p>a brilliant person like yourself,</p>
<p>about finding a balance between work and life?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such a thing, not a good thought experiment.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think balance is good,</p>
<p>but I also love to have sprints that are out of distribution</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when I think I&rsquo;ve been pretty creative as well.</p>
<p>Sprints out of distribution means that most of the time</p>
<p>you have a, quote unquote, balance.</p>
<p>I have balance most of the time,</p>
<p>but I like being obsessed with something once in a while.</p>
<p>Once in a while is what, once a week,</p>
<p>once a month, once a year?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably like say once a month or something, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we get a new GitHub repo for monitoring.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s when you like really care about a problem,</p>
<p>it must exist, this will be awesome,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re obsessed with it.</p>
<p>And now you can&rsquo;t just do it on that day.</p>
<p>You need to pay the fixed cost of getting into the groove</p>
<p>and then you need to stay there for a while</p>
<p>and then society will come and they will try to mess</p>
<p>with you and they will try to distract you.</p>
<p>Yeah, the worst thing is like a person who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I just need five minutes of your time.</p>
<p>This is, the cost of that is not five minutes</p>
<p>and society needs to change how it thinks about</p>
<p>just five minutes of your time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never, it&rsquo;s never, it&rsquo;s just one minute,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just 30 seconds, it&rsquo;s just a quick thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal, why are you being so?</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your computer setup?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like the perfect, are you somebody that&rsquo;s flexible</p>
<p>to no matter what, laptop, four screens?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or do you prefer a certain setup</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re most productive?</p>
<p>I guess the one that I&rsquo;m familiar with is one large screen,</p>
<p>27 inch and my laptop on the side.</p>
<p>What operating system?</p>
<p>I do Macs, that&rsquo;s my primary.</p>
<p>For all tasks?</p>
<p>I would say OSX, but when you&rsquo;re working on deep learning,</p>
<p>everything is Linux, you&rsquo;re SSH into a cluster</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working remotely.</p>
<p>But what about the actual development,</p>
<p>like using the IDE?</p>
<p>Yeah, you would use, I think a good way is you just run</p>
<p>VS code, my favorite editor right now on your Mac,</p>
<p>but you are actually, you have a remote folder</p>
<p>through SSH, so the actual files that you&rsquo;re manipulating</p>
<p>are in the cluster somewhere else.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the best IDE?</p>
<p>VS code, what else do people, so I use Emacs still.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It may be cool, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s maximum productivity.</p>
<p>So what do you recommend in terms of editors?</p>
<p>You worked a lot of software engineers,</p>
<p>editors for Python, C++, machine learning applications?</p>
<p>I think the current answer is VS code.</p>
<p>Currently, I believe that&rsquo;s the best IDE.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a huge amount of extensions.</p>
<p>It has GitHub Copilot integration,</p>
<p>which I think is very valuable.</p>
<p>What do you think about the Copilot integration?</p>
<p>I was actually, I got to talk a bunch with Guido Narasim,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a creator of Python, and he loves Copilot.</p>
<p>He like, he programs a lot with it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I use Copilot, I love it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s free for me, but I would pay for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>And the utility that I found with it was,</p>
<p>I would say there is a learning curve,</p>
<p>and you need to figure out when it&rsquo;s helpful</p>
<p>and when to pay attention to its outputs,</p>
<p>and when it&rsquo;s not going to be helpful,</p>
<p>where you should not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re just reading its suggestions all the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good way of interacting with it.</p>
<p>But I think I was able to sort of like mold myself to it.</p>
<p>I find it&rsquo;s very helpful, number one,</p>
<p>in copy, paste, and replace some parts.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, when the pattern is clear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good at completing the pattern.</p>
<p>And number two, sometimes it suggests APIs</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not aware of.</p>
<p>So it tells you about something that you didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an opportunity to discover a new API.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity to,</p>
<p>so I would never take Copilot code as given.</p>
<p>I almost always copy paste into a Google search,</p>
<p>and you see what this function is doing.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s actually exactly what I need.</p>
<p>Thank you, Copilot.</p>
<p>So you learned something.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in part a search engine,</p>
<p>a part maybe getting the exact syntax correctly,</p>
<p>that once you see it, it&rsquo;s that NP-hard thing.</p>
<p>Once you see it, you know-</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>But you yourself would struggle.</p>
<p>You can verify efficiently,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t generate efficiently.</p>
<p>And Copilot really, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s autopilot for programming, right?</p>
<p>And currently is doing the link following,</p>
<p>which is like the simple copy, paste,</p>
<p>and sometimes suggest.</p>
<p>But over time, it&rsquo;s going to become more and more autonomous.</p>
<p>And so the same thing will play out in not just coding,</p>
<p>but actually across many, many different things probably.</p>
<p>But coding is an important one, right?</p>
<p>Writing programs.</p>
<p>How do you see the future of that developing,</p>
<p>the program synthesis,</p>
<p>like being able to write programs</p>
<p>that are more and more complicated?</p>
<p>Because right now it&rsquo;s human supervised in interesting ways.</p>
<p>It feels like the transition will be very painful.</p>
<p>My mental model for it is the same thing will happen</p>
<p>as with the autopilot.</p>
<p>So currently it&rsquo;s doing link following.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing some simple stuff.</p>
<p>And eventually we&rsquo;ll be doing autonomy</p>
<p>and people will have to intervene less and less.</p>
<p>In other words, it could be like testing mechanisms.</p>
<p>Like if it writes a function</p>
<p>and that function looks pretty damn correct,</p>
<p>but how do you know it&rsquo;s correct?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re like getting lazier and lazier</p>
<p>as a programmer.</p>
<p>Like your ability to, because like little bugs,</p>
<p>but I guess it won&rsquo;t make little mistakes.</p>
<p>No, it will.</p>
<p>Copilot will make off by one subtle bugs.</p>
<p>It has done that to me.</p>
<p>But do you think future systems will?</p>
<p>Or is it really the off by one</p>
<p>is actually a fundamental challenge of programming?</p>
<p>In that case, it wasn&rsquo;t fundamental.</p>
<p>And I think things can improve,</p>
<p>but yeah, I think humans have to supervise.</p>
<p>I am nervous about people not supervising what comes out</p>
<p>and what happens to, for example,</p>
<p>the proliferation of bugs in all of our systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nervous about that,</p>
<p>but I think there will probably be some other copilots</p>
<p>for bug finding and stuff like that at some point,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;ll be like a lot more automation for.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a program, a copilot that generates a compiler,</p>
<p>one that does a linter.</p>
<p>One that does like a type checker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a committee of like a GPT sort of like.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be like a manager for the committee.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be somebody that says</p>
<p>a new version of this is needed.</p>
<p>We need to regenerate it.</p>
<p>There were 10 GPTs.</p>
<p>They were forwarded and gave 50 suggestions.</p>
<p>Another one looked at it and picked a few that they like.</p>
<p>A bug one looked at it and it was like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a bug.</p>
<p>They got re-ranked by some other thing.</p>
<p>And then a final ensemble GPT comes in and is like,</p>
<p>okay, given everything you guys have told me,</p>
<p>this is probably the next token.</p>
<p>You know, the feeling is the number of programmers</p>
<p>in the world has been growing and growing very quickly.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that it&rsquo;ll actually level out</p>
<p>and drop to like a very low number with this kind of world?</p>
<p>Because then you&rsquo;d be doing software 2.0 programming</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be doing this kind of generation</p>
<p>of copilot type systems programming,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t be doing the old school</p>
<p>software 1.0 programming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t currently think that they&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>to replace human programmers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so hesitant saying stuff like this, right?</p>
<p>Because this is going to be replaced in five years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s going to show that like,</p>
<p>this is where we thought, because I agree with you,</p>
<p>but I think we might be very surprised, right?</p>
<p>Like what are the next,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your sense of where we&rsquo;re staying</p>
<p>with language models?</p>
<p>Like, does it feel like the beginning or the middle</p>
<p>or the end?</p>
<p>The beginning, a hundred percent.</p>
<p>I think the big question in my mind is for sure,</p>
<p>I think GPT will be able to program quite well,</p>
<p>competently and so on.</p>
<p>How do you steer the system?</p>
<p>You still have to provide some guidance</p>
<p>to what you actually are looking for.</p>
<p>And so how do you steer it?</p>
<p>And how do you say, how do you talk to it?</p>
<p>How do you audit it and verify that what is done is correct?</p>
<p>And how do you like work with this?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s as much, not just an AI problem,</p>
<p>but a UI UX problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So beautiful, fertile ground for so much interesting work</p>
<p>for VS Code++ where you&rsquo;re not just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just human programming anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah. So you&rsquo;re interacting with the system.</p>
<p>So not just one prompt, but it&rsquo;s iterative prompting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to figure out having a conversation</p>
<p>with the system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That actually, I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s super exciting</p>
<p>to have a conversation with the program I&rsquo;m writing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Maybe at some point you&rsquo;re just conversing with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, here&rsquo;s what I want to do.</p>
<p>Actually, this variable,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not even that low level as a variable, but.</p>
<p>You can also imagine like,</p>
<p>can you translate this to C++ and back to Python?</p>
<p>Yeah, that already kind of exists in some ways.</p>
<p>No, but just like doing it</p>
<p>as part of the program experience.</p>
<p>Like, I think I&rsquo;d like to write this function in C++.</p>
<p>Or like, you just keep changing for different programs</p>
<p>because of different syntax.</p>
<p>Maybe I want to convert this into a functional language.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so like, you get to become multilingual as a programmer</p>
<p>and dance back and forth efficiently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the UI UX of it though</p>
<p>is like still very hard to think through</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just about writing code on a page.</p>
<p>You have an entire developer environment.</p>
<p>You have a bunch of hardware on it.</p>
<p>You have some environmental variables.</p>
<p>You have some scripts that are running in a Chrome job.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot going on to like working with computers</p>
<p>and how do these systems set up environment flags</p>
<p>and work across multiple machines</p>
<p>and set up screen sessions and automate different processes.</p>
<p>Like how all that works and is auditable by humans</p>
<p>and so on is like massive question at the moment.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve built Archive Sanity.</p>
<p>What is Archive?</p>
<p>And what is the future of academic research publishing</p>
<p>that you would like to see?</p>
<p>So Archive is this pre-print server.</p>
<p>So if you have a paper,</p>
<p>you can submit it for publication</p>
<p>to journals or conferences and then wait six months</p>
<p>and then maybe get a decision, pass or fail,</p>
<p>or you can just upload it to Archive.</p>
<p>And then people can tweet about it three minutes later.</p>
<p>And then everyone sees it, everyone reads it</p>
<p>and everyone can profit from it in their own little ways.</p>
<p>And you can cite it and it has an official look to it.</p>
<p>It feels like a publication process.</p>
<p>It feels different than if you just put it in a blog post.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a paper and usually the bar is higher</p>
<p>for something that you would expect on Archive</p>
<p>as opposed to something you would see in a blog post.</p>
<p>Well, the culture created the bar</p>
<p>because you could probably post a pretty crappy paper</p>
<p>in Archive.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that make you feel like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that make you feel about peer review?</p>
<p>So rigorous peer review by two, three experts</p>
<p>versus the peer review of the community</p>
<p>right as it&rsquo;s written.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically I think the community is very well able</p>
<p>to peer review things very quickly on Twitter.</p>
<p>And I think maybe it just has to do something</p>
<p>with AI machine learning field specifically though.</p>
<p>I feel like things are more easily auditable</p>
<p>and the verification is easier potentially</p>
<p>than the verification somewhere else.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>you can think of these scientific publications</p>
<p>as like little blockchains where everyone&rsquo;s building</p>
<p>on each other&rsquo;s work and citing each other.</p>
<p>And you sort of have AI,</p>
<p>which is kind of like this much faster and loose blockchain.</p>
<p>But then you have, and any one individual entry</p>
<p>is like very cheap to make.</p>
<p>And then you have other fields</p>
<p>where maybe that model doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense.</p>
<p>And so I think in AI,</p>
<p>at least things are pretty easily verifiable.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why when people upload papers</p>
<p>that are a really good idea and so on,</p>
<p>people can try it out like the next day</p>
<p>and they can be the final arbiter</p>
<p>of whether it works or not on their problem.</p>
<p>And the whole thing just moves significantly faster.</p>
<p>So I kind of feel like academia still has a place,</p>
<p>sort of this like conference journal process</p>
<p>still has a place,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of like, it lags behind, I think.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bit more maybe higher quality process,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not sort of the place</p>
<p>where you will discover cutting edge work anymore.</p>
<p>It used to be the case when I was starting my PhD</p>
<p>that you go to conferences and journals</p>
<p>and you discuss all the latest research.</p>
<p>Now, when you go to a conference or journal,</p>
<p>like no one discusses anything that&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s already like three generations ago irrelevant.</p>
<p>Yeah, which makes me sad about like DeepMind, for example,</p>
<p>where they still publish in nature</p>
<p>and these big prestigious,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s still value, I suppose,</p>
<p>to the prestige that comes with these big venues,</p>
<p>but the result is that they&rsquo;ll announce</p>
<p>some breakthrough performance</p>
<p>and it will take like a year</p>
<p>to actually publish the details.</p>
<p>I mean, and those details,</p>
<p>if they were published immediately,</p>
<p>would inspire the community</p>
<p>to move in certain directions.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would speed up the rest of the community,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know to what extent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of their objective function also.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the prestige,</p>
<p>a little bit of the delay is part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, they certainly, DeepMind specifically,</p>
<p>has been working in the regime</p>
<p>of having a slightly higher quality,</p>
<p>basically process and latency,</p>
<p>and publishing those papers that way.</p>
<p>Another question from Reddit.</p>
<p>Do you or have you suffered from imposter syndrome?</p>
<p>Being the director of AI at Tesla,</p>
<p>being this person when you&rsquo;re at Stanford</p>
<p>where the world looks at you as the expert in AI</p>
<p>to teach the world about machine learning?</p>
<p>When I was leaving Tesla after five years,</p>
<p>I spent a ton of time in meeting rooms</p>
<p>and I would read papers.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when I joined Tesla,</p>
<p>I was writing code,</p>
<p>and then I was writing less and less code,</p>
<p>and I was reading code,</p>
<p>and then I was reading less and less code.</p>
<p>And so this is just a natural progression</p>
<p>that happens, I think.</p>
<p>And definitely I would say near the tail end,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it sort of starts to hit you a bit more,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to be an expert,</p>
<p>but actually the source of truth</p>
<p>is the code that people are writing,</p>
<p>the GitHub, and the actual code itself.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not as familiar with that as you used to be.</p>
<p>And so I would say maybe there&rsquo;s some insecurity there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually pretty profound,</p>
<p>that a lot of the insecurity has to do</p>
<p>with not writing the code in the computer science space.</p>
<p>Because that is the truth, that right there.</p>
<p>The code is the source of truth.</p>
<p>The papers and everything else,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a high-level summary.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just a high-level summary,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, you have to read code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to translate all that code</p>
<p>into actual paper form.</p>
<p>So when things come out,</p>
<p>especially when they have a source code available,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my favorite place to go.</p>
<p>So like I said, you&rsquo;re one of the greatest teachers</p>
<p>of machine learning, AI, ever,</p>
<p>from CS231N to today.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to beginners</p>
<p>interested in getting into machine learning?</p>
<p>Beginners are often focused on what to do.</p>
<p>And I think the focus should be more like how much you do.</p>
<p>So I am kind of like believer on a high level</p>
<p>in this 10,000 hours kind of concept,</p>
<p>where you just kind of have to just pick the things</p>
<p>where you can spend time,</p>
<p>and you care about, and you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>You literally have to put in 10,000 hours of work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even matter as much where you put it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll iterate, and you&rsquo;ll improve,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll waste some time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a better way.</p>
<p>You need to put in 10,000 hours.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s actually really nice,</p>
<p>because I feel like there&rsquo;s some sense of determinism</p>
<p>about being an expert at a thing if you spend 10,000 hours.</p>
<p>You can literally pick an arbitrary thing,</p>
<p>and I think if you spend 10,000 hours</p>
<p>of deliberate effort and work,</p>
<p>you actually will become an expert at it.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s kind of like a nice thought.</p>
<p>And so basically, I would focus more on like,</p>
<p>are you spending 10,000 hours?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d focus on.</p>
<p>So, and then thinking about what kind of mechanisms</p>
<p>maximize your likelihood of getting to 10,000 hours,</p>
<p>which for us silly humans means probably</p>
<p>forming a daily habit of like every single day</p>
<p>actually doing the thing.</p>
<p>Whatever helps you.</p>
<p>So I do think to a large extent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a psychological problem for yourself.</p>
<p>One other thing that I help,</p>
<p>that I think is helpful for the psychology of it</p>
<p>is many times people compare themselves</p>
<p>to others in the area.</p>
<p>I think this is very harmful.</p>
<p>Only compare yourself to you from some time ago,</p>
<p>like say a year ago.</p>
<p>Are you better than you a year ago?</p>
<p>This is the only way to think.</p>
<p>And I think this, then you can see your progress</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very motivating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting that focus on the quantity of hours.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people in the beginner stage,</p>
<p>but actually throughout, get paralyzed by the choice.</p>
<p>Like which one, do I pick this path or this path?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll literally get paralyzed</p>
<p>by like which IDE to use.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re worried.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re worried about all these things.</p>
<p>But the thing is, some of the,</p>
<p>you will waste time doing something wrong.</p>
<p>You will eventually figure out it&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>You will accumulate scar tissue.</p>
<p>And next time you will grow stronger.</p>
<p>Because next time you&rsquo;ll have the scar tissue</p>
<p>and next time you&rsquo;ll learn from it.</p>
<p>And now next time you come to a similar situation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be like, oh, I messed up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time working on things</p>
<p>that never materialized into anything.</p>
<p>And I have all that scar tissue</p>
<p>and I have some intuitions about what was useful,</p>
<p>what wasn&rsquo;t useful, how things turned out.</p>
<p>So all those mistakes were not dead work.</p>
<p>So I just think you should,</p>
<p>did you just focus on working?</p>
<p>What have you done?</p>
<p>What have you done last week?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question, actually,</p>
<p>to ask for a lot of things, not just machine learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to cut the,</p>
<p>I forgot what the term we use,</p>
<p>but the fluff, the blubber, whatever the inefficiencies</p>
<p>in life.</p>
<p>What do you love about teaching?</p>
<p>You seem to find yourself often in the,</p>
<p>like drawn to teaching.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very good at it, but you&rsquo;re also drawn to it.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think I love teaching.</p>
<p>I love happy humans.</p>
<p>And happy humans like when I teach.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I hate teaching.</p>
<p>I tolerate teaching.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like the act of teaching that I like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I have something, I&rsquo;m actually okay at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay at teaching and people appreciate it a lot.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m just happy to try to be helpful.</p>
<p>And teaching itself is not like the most,</p>
<p>I mean, it can be really annoying, frustrating.</p>
<p>I was working on a bunch of lectures just now.</p>
<p>I was reminded back to my days of 231N</p>
<p>just how much work it is to create some of these materials</p>
<p>and make them good.</p>
<p>The amount of iteration and thought</p>
<p>and you go down blind alleys and just how much you change it.</p>
<p>So creating something good</p>
<p>in terms of educational value is really hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>So people should definitely go watch your new stuff</p>
<p>you put out.</p>
<p>There are lectures where you&rsquo;re actually building the thing</p>
<p>like from, like you said, the code is truth.</p>
<p>So discussing back propagation by building it,</p>
<p>by looking through it, just the whole thing.</p>
<p>So how difficult is that to prepare for?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful way to teach.</p>
<p>Did you have to prepare for that</p>
<p>or are you just live thinking through it?</p>
<p>I will typically do like say three takes</p>
<p>and then I take like the better take.</p>
<p>So I do multiple takes</p>
<p>and then I take some of the better takes</p>
<p>and then I just build out a lecture that way.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to delete 30 minutes of content</p>
<p>because it just went down an alley</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t like too much.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of iteration</p>
<p>and it probably takes me somewhere around 10 hours</p>
<p>to create one hour of content.</p>
<p>To get one hour.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, is it difficult to go back to the basics?</p>
<p>Do you draw a lot of wisdom from going back to the basics?</p>
<p>Yeah, going back to back propagation loss functions</p>
<p>and one thing I like about teaching a lot, honestly,</p>
<p>is it definitely strengthens your understanding.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a purely altruistic activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to learn.</p>
<p>If you have to explain something to someone,</p>
<p>you realize you have gaps in knowledge.</p>
<p>And so I even surprised myself in those lectures.</p>
<p>Like, oh, so the result will obviously look at this</p>
<p>and then the result doesn&rsquo;t look like it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, I thought I understood this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>They literally code, you run it in a notebook</p>
<p>and it gives you a result and you&rsquo;re like, oh, wow.</p>
<p>And like actual numbers, actual input, actual code.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not mathematical symbols, et cetera.</p>
<p>The source of truth is the code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not slides.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, let&rsquo;s build it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a rare human in that sense.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to researchers</p>
<p>trying to develop and publish idea</p>
<p>that have a big impact in the world of AI?</p>
<p>So maybe undergrads, maybe early graduate students.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say like,</p>
<p>they definitely have to be a little bit more strategic</p>
<p>than I had to be as a PhD student</p>
<p>because of the way AI is evolving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going the way of physics,</p>
<p>where in physics you used to be able to do experiments</p>
<p>on your benchtop and everything was great</p>
<p>and you can make progress.</p>
<p>And now you have to work in like LHC or like CERN.</p>
<p>And so AI is going in that direction as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certain kinds of things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not possible to do on the benchtop anymore.</p>
<p>And I think that didn&rsquo;t used to be the case at the time.</p>
<p>Do you still think that there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>GAN type papers to be written?</p>
<p>Where like very simple idea that requires</p>
<p>just one computer to illustrate a simple example?</p>
<p>I mean, one example that&rsquo;s been very influential recently</p>
<p>is diffusion models.</p>
<p>Diffusion models are amazing.</p>
<p>Diffusion models are six years old.</p>
<p>For the longest time, people were kind of ignoring them</p>
<p>as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re an amazing generative model,</p>
<p>especially in images.</p>
<p>And so stable diffusion and so on, it&rsquo;s all diffusion based.</p>
<p>Diffusion is new.</p>
<p>It was not there and it came from,</p>
<p>well, it came from Google,</p>
<p>but a researcher could have come up with it.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the first,</p>
<p>actually, no, those came from Google as well.</p>
<p>But a researcher could come up with that</p>
<p>in an academic institution.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you find most fascinating</p>
<p>about diffusion models?</p>
<p>So from the societal impact to the technical architecture.</p>
<p>What I like about diffusion is it works so well.</p>
<p>Is that surprising to you?</p>
<p>The variety, almost the novelty</p>
<p>of the synthetic data it&rsquo;s generating.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the stable diffusion images are incredible.</p>
<p>The speed of improvement in generating images</p>
<p>has been insane.</p>
<p>We went very quickly from generating tiny digits</p>
<p>to tiny faces and it all looked messed up</p>
<p>and now we have stable diffusion.</p>
<p>And that happened very quickly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that academia can still contribute.</p>
<p>For example, flash attention is a very efficient kernel</p>
<p>for running the attention operation inside the transformer.</p>
<p>That came from academic environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very clever way to structure the kernel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the calculation.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t materialize the attention matrix.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s still lots of things to contribute,</p>
<p>but you have to be just more strategic.</p>
<p>Do you think neural networks can be made to reason?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you think they already reason?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your definition of reasoning?</p>
<p>Information processing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So in the way that humans think through a problem</p>
<p>and come up with novel ideas,</p>
<p>it feels like reasoning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the novelty,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say,</p>
<p>but out of distribution ideas,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Yes, and I think we&rsquo;re seeing that already</p>
<p>in the current neural nets.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to remix the training set information</p>
<p>into true generalization in some sense.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t appear.</p>
<p>In a fundamental way in the training set.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re doing something interesting algorithmically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re manipulating some symbols</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re coming up with some correct,</p>
<p>a unique answer in a new setting.</p>
<p>What would illustrate to you,</p>
<p>holy shit, this thing is definitely thinking?</p>
<p>To me, thinking or reasoning</p>
<p>is just information processing and generalization.</p>
<p>And I think the neural nets already do that today.</p>
<p>So being able to perceive the world</p>
<p>or perceive whatever the inputs are</p>
<p>and to make predictions based on that</p>
<p>or actions based on that, that&rsquo;s reasoning.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re giving correct answers in novel settings</p>
<p>by manipulating information.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve learned the correct algorithm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing just some kind of a lookup table</p>
<p>on nearest neighbor search, something like that.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about AGI.</p>
<p>What are some moonshot ideas</p>
<p>you think might make significant progress towards AGI?</p>
<p>So maybe in other ways,</p>
<p>what are the big blockers that we&rsquo;re missing now?</p>
<p>So basically I am fairly bullish</p>
<p>on our ability to build AGIs.</p>
<p>Basically automated systems that we can interact with</p>
<p>that are very human-like</p>
<p>and we can interact with them</p>
<p>in a digital realm or a physical realm.</p>
<p>Currently it seems most of the models</p>
<p>that sort of do these sort of magical tasks</p>
<p>are in a text realm.</p>
<p>I think, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suspicious that the text realm</p>
<p>is not enough to actually build full understanding</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>I do actually think you need to go into pixels</p>
<p>and understand the physical world and how it works.</p>
<p>So I do think that we need to extend these models</p>
<p>to consume images and videos</p>
<p>and train on a lot more data</p>
<p>that is multimodal in that way.</p>
<p>Do you think you need to touch the world</p>
<p>to understand it also?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the big open question I would say in my mind</p>
<p>is if you also require the embodiment</p>
<p>and the ability to sort of interact with the world,</p>
<p>run experiments and have a data of that form,</p>
<p>then you need to go to Optimus or something like that.</p>
<p>And so I would say Optimus in some way</p>
<p>is like a hedge in AGI</p>
<p>because it seems to me that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that just having data from the internet is not enough.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then Optimus may lead to AGI</p>
<p>because Optimus, to me, there&rsquo;s nothing beyond Optimus.</p>
<p>You have like this humanoid form factor</p>
<p>that can actually like do stuff in the world.</p>
<p>You can have millions of them interacting</p>
<p>with humans and so on.</p>
<p>And if that doesn&rsquo;t give rise to AGI at some point,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not sure what will.</p>
<p>So from a completeness perspective,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really good platform,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a much harder platform</p>
<p>because you are dealing with atoms</p>
<p>and you need to actually like build these things</p>
<p>and integrate them into society.</p>
<p>So I think that path takes longer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more certain.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a path of the internet</p>
<p>and just like training these compression models effectively</p>
<p>on trying to compress all the internet.</p>
<p>And that might also give these agents as well.</p>
<p>Compress the internet,</p>
<p>but also interact with the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not obvious to me.</p>
<p>In fact, I suspect you can reach AGI</p>
<p>without ever entering the physical world.</p>
<p>And which is a little bit more concerning</p>
<p>because that results in it happening faster.</p>
<p>So it just feels like we&rsquo;re in boiling water.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t know as it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of AGI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always concerns,</p>
<p>but I would like to know when it happens.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And have like hints about when it happens,</p>
<p>like a year from now it will happen, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just feel like in the digital realm,</p>
<p>it just might happen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think all we have available to us,</p>
<p>because no one has built AGI again.</p>
<p>So all we have available to us is,</p>
<p>is there enough fertile ground on the periphery?</p>
<p>I would say yes.</p>
<p>And we have the progress.</p>
<p>So far, which has been very rapid.</p>
<p>And there are next steps that are available.</p>
<p>And so I would say, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite likely that we&rsquo;ll be interacting</p>
<p>with digital entities.</p>
<p>How will you know that somebody has built AGI?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a slow,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a slow incremental transition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be product based and focused.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be GitHub Copilot getting better.</p>
<p>And then GPT is helping you write.</p>
<p>And then these oracles that you can go to</p>
<p>with mathematical problems.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re on a verge of being able to ask</p>
<p>very complex questions in chemistry, physics, math</p>
<p>of these oracles and have them complete solutions.</p>
<p>So AGI to use primarily focused on intelligence.</p>
<p>So consciousness doesn&rsquo;t enter into it.</p>
<p>So in my mind, consciousness is not a special thing</p>
<p>you will figure out and bolt on.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an emergent phenomenon of a large enough</p>
<p>and complex enough generative model, sort of.</p>
<p>So if you have a complex enough world model,</p>
<p>that understands the world,</p>
<p>then it also understands its predicament in the world</p>
<p>as being a language model,</p>
<p>which to me is a form of consciousness or self-awareness.</p>
<p>So in order to understand the world deeply,</p>
<p>you probably have to integrate yourself into the world.</p>
<p>And in order to interact with humans</p>
<p>and other living beings,</p>
<p>consciousness is a very useful tool.</p>
<p>I think consciousness is like a modeling insight.</p>
<p>Modeling insight.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a, you have a powerful enough model</p>
<p>of understanding the world that you actually understand</p>
<p>that you are an entity in it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s also this,</p>
<p>perhaps just the narrative we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>It feels like something to experience the world.</p>
<p>The hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>But that could be just a narrative that we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think, I think it will emerge.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be something very boring.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll be talking to these digital AIs.</p>
<p>They will claim they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>They will appear conscious.</p>
<p>They will do all the things</p>
<p>that you would expect of other humans.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to just be a stalemate.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll be a lot of actual</p>
<p>fascinating ethical questions.</p>
<p>Like Supreme Court level questions</p>
<p>of whether you&rsquo;re allowed to turn off a conscious AI.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re allowed to build a conscious AI.</p>
<p>Maybe there would have to be the same kind of debates</p>
<p>that you have around,</p>
<p>sorry to bring up a political topic,</p>
<p>but abortion, which is the deeper question with abortion,</p>
<p>is what is life?</p>
<p>And the deep question with AI is also,</p>
<p>what is life and what is conscious?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;ll be very fascinating to bring up.</p>
<p>It might become illegal to build systems</p>
<p>that are capable of such level of intelligence</p>
<p>that consciousness would emerge</p>
<p>and therefore the capacity to suffer would emerge.</p>
<p>And a system that says, no, please don&rsquo;t kill me.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what the Lambda chatbot</p>
<p>already told this Google engineer, right?</p>
<p>Like it was talking about not wanting to die or so on.</p>
<p>So that might become illegal to do that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because otherwise you might have a lot of creatures</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t want to die.</p>
<p>And they will-</p>
<p>You can just spawn infinity of them on a cluster.</p>
<p>And then that might lead to like horrible consequences</p>
<p>because then there might be a lot of people</p>
<p>that secretly love murder</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll start practicing murder on those systems.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just, to me, all of this stuff</p>
<p>just brings a beautiful mirror to the human condition</p>
<p>and human nature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to explore it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what like the best of the Supreme Court,</p>
<p>of all the different debates we have about ideas,</p>
<p>of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>We get to ask those deep questions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been asking throughout human history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always been the other in human history.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the good guys and that&rsquo;s the bad guys.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to, throughout human history,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s murder the bad guys.</p>
<p>And the same will probably happen with robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be the other at first.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll get to ask questions</p>
<p>of what does it mean to be alive?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be conscious?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s some canary in the coal mines,</p>
<p>even with what we have today.</p>
<p>And for example, there&rsquo;s these waifus</p>
<p>that you can work with.</p>
<p>And some people are trying to,</p>
<p>this company is going to shut down,</p>
<p>but this person really loved their waifu</p>
<p>and is trying to port it somewhere else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>I think definitely people will have feelings</p>
<p>towards these systems.</p>
<p>Because in some sense, they are like a mirror of humanity</p>
<p>because they are sort of like a big average of humanity</p>
<p>in the way that it&rsquo;s trained.</p>
<p>But we can, that average, we can actually watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to be able to interact</p>
<p>with the big average of humanity</p>
<p>and do a search query on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very fascinating.</p>
<p>And we can also, of course, also shape it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a pure average.</p>
<p>We can mess with the training data.</p>
<p>We can mess with the objective.</p>
<p>We can fine tune them in various ways.</p>
<p>So we have some impact on what those systems look like.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve AGI,</p>
<p>and you could have a conversation with her</p>
<p>and ask her, talk about anything,</p>
<p>maybe ask her a question,</p>
<p>what kind of stuff would you ask?</p>
<p>I would have some practical questions in my mind,</p>
<p>like do I or my loved ones really have to die?</p>
<p>What can we do about that?</p>
<p>Do you think it will answer clearly</p>
<p>or would it answer poetically?</p>
<p>I would expect it to give solutions.</p>
<p>I would expect it to be like,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ve read all of these textbooks</p>
<p>and I know all these things that you&rsquo;ve produced.</p>
<p>And it seems to me like here are the experiments</p>
<p>that I think it would be useful to run next.</p>
<p>And here are some gene therapies</p>
<p>that I think would be helpful.</p>
<p>And here are the kinds of experiments that you should run.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go with this thought experiment, okay?</p>
<p>Imagine that mortality is actually</p>
<p>like a prerequisite for happiness.</p>
<p>So if we become immortal,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll actually become deeply unhappy.</p>
<p>And the model is able to know that.</p>
<p>So what is it supposed to tell you,</p>
<p>stupid human, about it?</p>
<p>Yes, you can become immortal,</p>
<p>but you will become deeply unhappy.</p>
<p>If the model is, if the AGI system</p>
<p>is trying to empathize with you human,</p>
<p>what is it supposed to tell you?</p>
<p>That yes, you don&rsquo;t have to die,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re really not gonna like it?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be deeply honest?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a interstellar, what is it?</p>
<p>The AI says like, humans want 90% honesty.</p>
<p>So like you have to pick how honest</p>
<p>do I wanna answer these practical questions?</p>
<p>Yeah, I love AI interstellar, by the way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like such a sidekick to the entire story,</p>
<p>but at the same time, it&rsquo;s like really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of limited in certain ways, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s limited.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s totally fine, by the way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I think it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>and plausible to have a limited and imperfect AGIs.</p>
<p>Is that a feature almost?</p>
<p>As an example, like it has a fixed amount of compute</p>
<p>on its physical body.</p>
<p>And it might just be that,</p>
<p>even though you can have a super amazing mega brain,</p>
<p>super intelligent AI, you also can have like,</p>
<p>you know, less intelligent AIs that you can deploy</p>
<p>and in a power efficient way.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re not perfect, they might make mistakes.</p>
<p>No, I meant more like, say you had infinite compute</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still good to make mistakes sometimes.</p>
<p>Like in order to integrate yourself, like, what is it?</p>
<p>Going back to Good Will Hunting,</p>
<p>Robin Williams&rsquo; character says like the human imperfections,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the good stuff, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the, like, we don&rsquo;t want perfect,</p>
<p>we want flaws in part to form connections with each other,</p>
<p>because it feels like something you can attach</p>
<p>your feelings to, the flaws.</p>
<p>In that same way, you want an AI that&rsquo;s flawed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel like perfection is cool.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re saying, okay, yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not AGI.</p>
<p>But see, AGI would need to be intelligent enough</p>
<p>to give answers to humans that humans don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And I think perfect is something humans can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Because even science doesn&rsquo;t give perfect answers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gaps and mysteries and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if humans want perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could imagine just having a conversation</p>
<p>with this kind of oracle entity, as you&rsquo;d imagine them.</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe it can tell you about,</p>
<p>you know, based on my analysis of human condition,</p>
<p>you might not want this.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s some of the things that might matter.</p>
<p>But every dumb human will say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>I can, give me the truth.</p>
<p>I can handle it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the beauty.</p>
<p>Like, people can choose, so.</p>
<p>But then, it&rsquo;s the old marshmallow test with the kids</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I feel like too many people, like, can&rsquo;t handle the truth.</p>
<p>Probably including myself.</p>
<p>Like, the deep truth of the human condition,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can handle it.</p>
<p>Like, what if there&rsquo;s some dark stuff?</p>
<p>What if we are an alien science experiment?</p>
<p>And it realizes that.</p>
<p>What if it had, I mean.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the matrix, you know, all over again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What would I talk about?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, yeah.</p>
<p>I, probably I will go with the safer scientific questions</p>
<p>at first that have nothing to do with my own personal life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And mortality.</p>
<p>Just like about physics and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To build up, like, let&rsquo;s see where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>Or maybe see if it has a sense of humor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another question.</p>
<p>Would it be able to, presumably, in order to,</p>
<p>if it understands humans deeply,</p>
<p>would it be able to generate, to generate humor?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually a wonderful benchmark, almost.</p>
<p>Like, is it able,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really good point, basically.</p>
<p>To make you laugh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s able to be like a very effective standup comedian</p>
<p>that is doing something very interesting computationally.</p>
<p>I think being funny is extremely hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s hard in a way, like a Turing test,</p>
<p>the original intent of the Turing test is hard</p>
<p>because you have to convince humans.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing, that&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when comedians talk about this,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s, this is deeply honest.</p>
<p>Because if people can&rsquo;t help but laugh,</p>
<p>and if they don&rsquo;t laugh, that means you&rsquo;re not funny.</p>
<p>If they laugh, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re showing, you need a lot of knowledge</p>
<p>to create humor.</p>
<p>About, like you mentioned, human condition and so on.</p>
<p>And then you need to be clever with it.</p>
<p>You mentioned a few movies.</p>
<p>You tweeted, movies that I&rsquo;ve seen five plus times,</p>
<p>but am ready and willing to keep watching.</p>
<p>Interstellar, Gladiator, Contact,</p>
<p>Good Will Hunting, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings,</p>
<p>all three, Avatar, Fifth Element, so on.</p>
<p>It goes on.</p>
<p>Terminator 2, mean girls, I&rsquo;m not gonna ask about that.</p>
<p>I think, I think her man.</p>
<p>Mean girls is great.</p>
<p>What are some that jump out to you in your memory</p>
<p>that you love and why?</p>
<p>Like you mentioned The Matrix.</p>
<p>As a computer person, why do you love The Matrix?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many properties</p>
<p>that make it like beautiful and interesting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these philosophical questions,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also AGIs,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s simulation, and it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know, the black, you know.</p>
<p>The look of it, the feel of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the look of it, the feel of it,</p>
<p>the action, the bullet time.</p>
<p>It was just like innovating in so many ways.</p>
<p>And then Good Will Hunting, why do you like that one?</p>
<p>Yeah, I just, I really like this tortured genius</p>
<p>sort of character who&rsquo;s like grappling</p>
<p>with whether or not he has like any responsibility</p>
<p>or like what to do with this gift that he was given</p>
<p>or like how to think about the whole thing.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a dance between the genius</p>
<p>and the personal, like what it means</p>
<p>to love another human being.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of themes there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a beautiful movie.</p>
<p>And then the fatherly figure,</p>
<p>the mentor and the psychiatrist.</p>
<p>It like really like, it messes with you.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some movies</p>
<p>that just like really mess with you on a deep level.</p>
<p>Do you relate to that movie at all?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault, Andre, as I said.</p>
<p>Lord of the Rings, that&rsquo;s self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Terminator 2, which is interesting.</p>
<p>You re-watched that a lot.</p>
<p>Is that better than Terminator 1?</p>
<p>You like Arnold?</p>
<p>I do like Terminator 1 as well.</p>
<p>I like Terminator 2 a little bit more,</p>
<p>but in terms of like its surface properties.</p>
<p>Do you think Skynet is at all a possibility?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like the actual sort of autonomous weapon system</p>
<p>kind of thing?</p>
<p>Do you worry about that stuff?</p>
<p>AI being used for war?</p>
<p>I 100% worry about it.</p>
<p>And so the, I mean, the, you know,</p>
<p>some of these fears of AGIs and how this will plan out.</p>
<p>I mean, these will be like very powerful entities</p>
<p>probably at some point.</p>
<p>And so for a long time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be tools in the hands of humans.</p>
<p>You know, people talk about like alignment of AGIs</p>
<p>and how to make, the problem is like,</p>
<p>even humans are not aligned.</p>
<p>So how this will be used</p>
<p>and what this is going to look like is,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s troubling, so.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;ll happen slowly enough</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll be able to, as a human civilization,</p>
<p>think through the problems?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s my hope is that it happens slowly enough</p>
<p>and in an open enough way</p>
<p>where a lot of people can see and participate in it.</p>
<p>Just to figure out how to deal with this transition,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be interesting.</p>
<p>I draw a lot of inspiration from nuclear weapons</p>
<p>because I sure thought it would be fucked</p>
<p>once they developed nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>But like, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>when the systems are not so dangerous,</p>
<p>they destroy human civilization,</p>
<p>we deploy them and learn the lessons.</p>
<p>And then we quickly, if it&rsquo;s too dangerous,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll quickly, quickly, we might still deploy it,</p>
<p>but you very quickly learn not to use them.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;ll be like this balance achieved.</p>
<p>Humans are very clever as a species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We exploit the resources as much as we can,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t, we avoid destroying ourselves,</p>
<p>it seems like.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that, actually.</p>
<p>I hope it continues.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m definitely concerned</p>
<p>about nuclear weapons and so on,</p>
<p>not just as a result of the recent conflict,</p>
<p>even before that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably my number one concern for humanity.</p>
<p>So if humanity destroys itself</p>
<p>or destroys 90% of people,</p>
<p>that would be because of nukes?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even about the full destruction.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s bad enough if we reset society.</p>
<p>That would be terrible.</p>
<p>It would be really bad.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re like so close to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like so crazy to me.</p>
<p>It feels like we might be a few tweets away</p>
<p>from something like that.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s extremely unnerving,</p>
<p>but, and has been for me for a long time.</p>
<p>It seems unstable that world leaders,</p>
<p>just having a bad mood,</p>
<p>can like take one step towards a bad direction</p>
<p>and it escalates.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because of a collection of bad moods,</p>
<p>it can escalate without being able to stop.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a huge amount of power.</p>
<p>And then also with the proliferation.</p>
<p>Basically, I don&rsquo;t actually really see,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know what the good outcomes are here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m definitely worried about it a lot.</p>
<p>And then AGI is not currently there,</p>
<p>but I think at some point will more and more become</p>
<p>something like it.</p>
<p>The danger with AGI even is that,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s even like slightly worse</p>
<p>in a sense that there are good outcomes of AGI.</p>
<p>And then the bad outcomes are like an epsilon away,</p>
<p>like a tiny one away.</p>
<p>And so I think capitalism and humanity and so on</p>
<p>will drive for the positive ways of using that technology.</p>
<p>But then if bad outcomes are just like a tiny,</p>
<p>like flip a minus sign away,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really bad position to be in.</p>
<p>A tiny perturbation of the system</p>
<p>results in the destruction of the human species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird line to walk.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think in general,</p>
<p>this was really weird about like the dynamics of humanity</p>
<p>in this explosion we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the insane coupling afforded by technology</p>
<p>and just the instability of the whole dynamical system.</p>
<p>I think it just doesn&rsquo;t look good, honestly.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that explosion could be destructive</p>
<p>or constructive and the probabilities are non-zero</p>
<p>in both ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>I do feel like I have to try to be optimistic and so on.</p>
<p>And I think even in this case,</p>
<p>I still am predominantly optimistic,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s definitely&hellip;</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll become a multi-planetary species?</p>
<p>Probably yes,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s dominant feature of future humanity.</p>
<p>There might be some people on some planets and so on,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yeah, if it&rsquo;s like a major player in our culture and so on.</p>
<p>We still have to solve the drivers</p>
<p>of self-destruction here on Earth.</p>
<p>So just having a backup on Mars</p>
<p>is not gonna solve the problem.</p>
<p>So by the way, I love the backup on Mars.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>You should absolutely do that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so thankful.</p>
<p>Would you go to Mars?</p>
<p>Personally, no, I do like Earth quite a lot.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll go to Mars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tweet at you from there.</p>
<p>Maybe eventually I would once it&rsquo;s safe enough,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t actually know if it&rsquo;s on my lifetime scale,</p>
<p>unless I can extend it by a lot.</p>
<p>I do think that, for example,</p>
<p>a lot of people might disappear into virtual realities</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I think that could be the major thrust</p>
<p>of sort of the cultural development of humanity.</p>
<p>So it might not be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just really hard to work in physical realm</p>
<p>and go out there.</p>
<p>And I think ultimately all your experiences</p>
<p>are in your brain.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s much easier to disappear into digital realm.</p>
<p>And I think people will find them more compelling,</p>
<p>easier, safer, more interesting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a little bit captivated by virtual reality,</p>
<p>by the possible worlds,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the metaverse</p>
<p>or some other manifestation of that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested, just talking a lot to Carmack,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s currently preventing that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, to be clear,</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s interesting about the future is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that,</p>
<p>I kind of feel like the variance</p>
<p>in the human condition grows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the primary thing that&rsquo;s changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as much the mean of the distribution,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the variance of it.</p>
<p>So there will probably be people on Mars</p>
<p>and there will be people in VR</p>
<p>and there will be people here on earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many more ways of being.</p>
<p>And so I kind of feel like,</p>
<p>I see it as like a spreading out of a human experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the internet</p>
<p>that allows you to discover those little groups</p>
<p>and then you gravitate to something about your biology</p>
<p>likes that kind of world and that you find each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll have transhumanists</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll have the Amish</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>everything is just gonna coexist.</p>
<p>You know, the cool thing about it,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve interacted with a bunch of internet communities,</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t know about each other.</p>
<p>Like you can have a very happy existence,</p>
<p>just like having a very close-knit community</p>
<p>and not knowing about each other.</p>
<p>I mean, even you haven&rsquo;t sensed this,</p>
<p>just having traveled to Ukraine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, they don&rsquo;t know so many things about America.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like when you travel across the world,</p>
<p>I think you experience this too.</p>
<p>There are certain cultures that are like,</p>
<p>they have their own thing going on.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so you can see that happening more and more</p>
<p>and more and more in the future.</p>
<p>We have little communities.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>That seems to be the,</p>
<p>that seems to be how it&rsquo;s going right now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see that trend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it like really reversing.</p>
<p>I think people are diverse</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to choose their own path in existence.</p>
<p>And I sort of like celebrate that.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>Will you spend so much time in the metaverse,</p>
<p>in the virtual reality?</p>
<p>Or which community are you?</p>
<p>Are you the physicalist,</p>
<p>the physical reality enjoyer,</p>
<p>or do you see drawing a lot of pleasure</p>
<p>and fulfillment in the digital world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, well,</p>
<p>currently the virtual reality is not that compelling.</p>
<p>I do think it can improve a lot,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really know to what extent.</p>
<p>Maybe, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually like even more exotic things</p>
<p>you can think about with like neural links</p>
<p>or stuff like that.</p>
<p>So currently I kind of see myself</p>
<p>as mostly a team human person.</p>
<p>I love nature.</p>
<p>I love harmony.</p>
<p>I love people.</p>
<p>I love humanity.</p>
<p>I love emotions of humanity.</p>
<p>And I just want to be like,</p>
<p>in this like solar punk little utopia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my happy place.</p>
<p>My happy place is like people I love</p>
<p>thinking about cool problems</p>
<p>surrounded by a lush, beautiful, dynamic nature</p>
<p>and a secretly high tech in places that count.</p>
<p>Places that count.</p>
<p>So you use technology to empower that love</p>
<p>for other humans and nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think technology used like very sparingly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love when it sort of gets in the way of humanity</p>
<p>in many ways.</p>
<p>I like just people being humans in a way.</p>
<p>We sort of like slightly evolved and prefer,</p>
<p>I think, just by default.</p>
<p>People kept asking me,</p>
<p>because they know you love reading.</p>
<p>Are there particular books that you enjoyed</p>
<p>that had an impact on you for silly</p>
<p>or for profound reasons that you would recommend?</p>
<p>You mentioned the vital question.</p>
<p>Many, of course.</p>
<p>I think in biology, as an example,</p>
<p>the vital question is a good one.</p>
<p>Anything by Nick Lane, really.</p>
<p>Life Ascending, I would say,</p>
<p>is like a bit more potentially representative</p>
<p>as like a summary of a lot of the things</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been talking about.</p>
<p>I was very impacted by The Selfish Gene.</p>
<p>I thought that was a really good book</p>
<p>that helped me understand altruism as an example</p>
<p>and where it comes from and just realizing</p>
<p>that the selectionism of genes</p>
<p>was a huge insight for me at the time.</p>
<p>And it sort of like cleared up a lot of things for me.</p>
<p>What do you think about the idea</p>
<p>that ideas are the organisms, the means?</p>
<p>Yes, love it, 100%.</p>
<p>Are you able to walk around with that notion for a while,</p>
<p>that there is an evolutionary kind of process</p>
<p>with ideas as well?</p>
<p>There absolutely is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s memes just like genes and they compete</p>
<p>and they live in our brains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Are we silly humans thinking that we&rsquo;re the organisms?</p>
<p>Is it possible that the primary organisms are the ideas?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say like the ideas kind of live</p>
<p>in the software of like our civilization</p>
<p>in the minds and so on.</p>
<p>We think as humans that the hardware</p>
<p>is the fundamental thing.</p>
<p>I, human, is a hardware entity.</p>
<p>But it could be the software, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say like there needs to be some grounding</p>
<p>at some point to like a physical reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if we clone an Andre,</p>
<p>the software is the thing,</p>
<p>like is the thing that makes that thing special, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But then cloning might be exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>Like there might be a deep integration</p>
<p>between the software and the hardware</p>
<p>in ways we don&rsquo;t quite understand.</p>
<p>Well, from the alien point of view,</p>
<p>like what makes me special is more like</p>
<p>the gang of genes that are riding in my chromosomes,</p>
<p>I suppose, right?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re the replicating unit, I suppose.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s just the thing that makes you special, sure.</p>
<p>Well, the reality is what makes you special</p>
<p>is your ability to survive based on the software</p>
<p>that runs on the hardware that was built by the genes.</p>
<p>So the software is the thing that makes you survive,</p>
<p>not the hardware.</p>
<p>Or I guess it&rsquo;s the two of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a second layer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new second layer that hasn&rsquo;t been there</p>
<p>before the brain.</p>
<p>They both coexist.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also layers of the software.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a little abstraction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on top of abstractions.</p>
<p>But okay, selfish gene.</p>
<p>So selfish gene, Nick Lane.</p>
<p>I would say sometimes books are like not sufficient.</p>
<p>I like to reach for textbooks sometimes.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like books are for too much</p>
<p>of a general consumption sometimes.</p>
<p>And they just kind of like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re too high up in the level of abstraction</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>So I like textbooks.</p>
<p>I like The Cell.</p>
<p>I think The Cell was pretty cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why also I like the writing of Nick Lane</p>
<p>is because he&rsquo;s pretty willing to step one level down</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t, yeah, he&rsquo;s sort of, he&rsquo;s willing to go there.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s also willing to sort of be throughout the stack.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;ll go down to a lot of detail,</p>
<p>but then he will come back up.</p>
<p>And I think he has a, yeah,</p>
<p>basically I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love college, early college,</p>
<p>even high school.</p>
<p>Just textbooks on the basics of computer science,</p>
<p>of mathematics, of biology, of chemistry.</p>
<p>Those are, they condense down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sufficiently general that you can understand</p>
<p>both the philosophy and the details,</p>
<p>but also like you get homework problems</p>
<p>and you get to play with it as much as you would</p>
<p>if you were in programming stuff.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m also suspicious of textbooks, honestly,</p>
<p>because as an example in deep learning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no like amazing textbooks</p>
<p>and the field is changing very quickly.</p>
<p>I imagine the same is true in say synthetic biology</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>These books like The Cell are kind of outdated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still high level.</p>
<p>Like what is the actual real source of truth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people in wet labs working with cells,</p>
<p>sequencing genomes and yeah, actually working with it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have that much exposure to that</p>
<p>or what that looks like.</p>
<p>So I still don&rsquo;t fully, I&rsquo;m reading through The Cell</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of interesting and I&rsquo;m learning,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still not sufficient, I would say,</p>
<p>in terms of understanding.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a clean summarization</p>
<p>of the mainstream narrative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you have to learn that before you break out</p>
<p>towards the cutting edge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is the actual process of working with these cells</p>
<p>and growing them and incubating them?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like a massive cooking recipes</p>
<p>of making sure your cells lives and proliferate</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re sequencing them, running experiments</p>
<p>and just how that works,</p>
<p>I think is kind of like the source of truth</p>
<p>of at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really useful in terms of creating therapies</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder what in the future AI textbooks will be,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>the modern approach.</p>
<p>I actually haven&rsquo;t read if it&rsquo;s come out,</p>
<p>the recent version, there&rsquo;s been a recent edition.</p>
<p>I also saw there&rsquo;s a science and deep learning book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for textbooks that are worth recommending,</p>
<p>worth reading.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tricky because it&rsquo;s like papers and code, code, code.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think papers are quite good.</p>
<p>I especially like the appendix of any paper as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the most detail you can have.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be cohesive,</p>
<p>connected to anything else.</p>
<p>You just described me a very specific way</p>
<p>you saw the particular thing, yeah.</p>
<p>Many times papers can be actually quite readable,</p>
<p>not always, but sometimes the introduction</p>
<p>and the abstract is readable,</p>
<p>even for someone outside of the field.</p>
<p>This is not always true.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think, unfortunately,</p>
<p>scientists use complex terms, even when it&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s harmful.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no reason for that.</p>
<p>And papers sometimes are longer than they need to be</p>
<p>in the parts that don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Appendix would be long, but then the paper itself,</p>
<p>look at Einstein, make it simple.</p>
<p>Yeah, but certainly I&rsquo;ve come across papers,</p>
<p>I would say, like synthetic biology or something</p>
<p>that I thought were quite readable</p>
<p>for the abstract and the introduction.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re reading the rest of it</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t fully understand,</p>
<p>but you kind of are getting a gist and I think it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>What advice, you give advice to folks</p>
<p>interested in machine learning and research,</p>
<p>but in general, life advice to a young person,</p>
<p>high school, early college,</p>
<p>about how to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;m very hesitant to give general advice.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned, like some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>is fairly general, I think,</p>
<p>like focus on just the amount of work you&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>on like a thing, compare yourself only to yourself,</p>
<p>not to others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I think those are fairly general.</p>
<p>How do you pick the thing?</p>
<p>You just have like a deep interest in something</p>
<p>or like try to like find the argmax</p>
<p>over like the things that you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Argmax at that moment and stick with it.</p>
<p>How do you not get distracted and switch to another thing?</p>
<p>You can, if you like.</p>
<p>Well, if you do an argmax repeatedly,</p>
<p>every week, every month.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t converge.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can like low pass filter yourself</p>
<p>in terms of like what has consistently been true for you.</p>
<p>But yeah, I definitely see how it can be hard,</p>
<p>but I would say like you&rsquo;re going to work the hardest</p>
<p>on the thing that you care about the most.</p>
<p>So low pass filter yourself and really introspect.</p>
<p>In your past, what are the things that gave you energy?</p>
<p>And what are the things that took energy away from you?</p>
<p>Concrete examples.</p>
<p>And usually from those concrete examples,</p>
<p>sometimes patterns can emerge.</p>
<p>I like it when things look like this</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m in these positions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not necessarily the field,</p>
<p>but the kind of stuff you&rsquo;re doing in a particular field.</p>
<p>So for you, it seems like you were energized</p>
<p>by implementing stuff, building actual things.</p>
<p>Yeah, being low level learning.</p>
<p>And then also communicating</p>
<p>so that others can go through the same realizations</p>
<p>and shortening that gap.</p>
<p>Because I usually have to do way too much work</p>
<p>to understand a thing.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, okay, this is actually like,</p>
<p>okay, I think I get it.</p>
<p>And like, why was it so much work?</p>
<p>It should have been much less work.</p>
<p>And that gives me a lot of frustration.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I sometimes go teach.</p>
<p>So aside from the teaching you&rsquo;re doing now,</p>
<p>putting out videos,</p>
<p>aside from a potential Godfather part two</p>
<p>with the AGI at Tesla and beyond,</p>
<p>what does the future for Andrej Karpathy hold?</p>
<p>Have you figured that out yet or no?</p>
<p>I mean, as you see through the fog of war,</p>
<p>that is all of our future.</p>
<p>Do you start seeing silhouettes</p>
<p>of what that possible future could look like?</p>
<p>The consistent thing I&rsquo;ve been always interested in,</p>
<p>for me at least, is AI.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably what I&rsquo;m spending</p>
<p>the rest of my life on,</p>
<p>because I just care about it a lot.</p>
<p>And I actually care about like many other problems as well,</p>
<p>like say aging, which I basically view as disease.</p>
<p>And I care about that as well,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>to go after it specifically.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually think that humans</p>
<p>will be able to come up with the answer.</p>
<p>I think the correct thing to do is to ignore those problems</p>
<p>and you solve AI and then use that to solve everything else.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a chance that this will work.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very high chance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of like the way I&rsquo;m betting at least.</p>
<p>So when you think about AI,</p>
<p>are you interested in all kinds of applications,</p>
<p>all kinds of domains,</p>
<p>and any domain you focus on will allow you</p>
<p>to get insights to the big problem of AGI?</p>
<p>Yeah, for me, it&rsquo;s the ultimate meta problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to work on any one specific problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many problems.</p>
<p>So how can you work on all problems simultaneously?</p>
<p>You solve the meta problem,</p>
<p>which to me is just intelligence.</p>
<p>And how do you automate it?</p>
<p>Is there cool small projects like Archive Sanity</p>
<p>and so on that you&rsquo;re thinking about?</p>
<p>That the world, the ML world can anticipate?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always like some fun side projects.</p>
<p>Archive Sanity is one.</p>
<p>Basically like there&rsquo;s way too many archive papers.</p>
<p>How can I organize it and recommend papers and so on?</p>
<p>I transcribed all of your podcasts.</p>
<p>What did you learn from that experience?</p>
<p>From transcribing the process of,</p>
<p>like you like consuming audio books and podcasts and so on.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a process that achieves</p>
<p>closer to human level performance on annotation.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I definitely was like surprised</p>
<p>that transcription with OpenAI&rsquo;s Whisper</p>
<p>was working so well,</p>
<p>compared to what I&rsquo;m familiar with from Siri</p>
<p>and like a few other systems, I guess.</p>
<p>It works so well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what gave me some energy to like try it out.</p>
<p>And I thought it could be fun to run on podcasts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of not obvious to me</p>
<p>why Whisper is so much better compared to anything else,</p>
<p>because I feel like there should be a lot of incentive</p>
<p>for a lot of companies to produce transcription systems.</p>
<p>And that they&rsquo;ve done so over a long time.</p>
<p>Whisper is not a super exotic model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transformer.</p>
<p>It takes MEL spectrograms and just outputs tokens of text.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not crazy.</p>
<p>The model and everything has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually 100% sure why this came out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious to me either.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like I&rsquo;m missing something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing something.</p>
<p>Yeah, because there is a huge,</p>
<p>even at Google and so on, YouTube transcription.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>But some of it is also integrating into a bigger system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That, so the user interface,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s deployed and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe running it as an independent thing is much easier,</p>
<p>like an order of magnitude easier</p>
<p>than deploying to a large integrated system</p>
<p>like YouTube transcription or anything like meetings.</p>
<p>Like Zoom has transcription.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of crappy.</p>
<p>But creating an interface</p>
<p>where it detects the different individual speakers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to display it in compelling ways,</p>
<p>run it in real time, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the only explanation I have</p>
<p>because like I&rsquo;m currently paying quite a bit</p>
<p>for human transcription, human captions.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Annotation.</p>
<p>And like, it seems like there&rsquo;s a huge incentive</p>
<p>to automate that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very confusing.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you looked</p>
<p>at some of the Whisper transcripts,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re quite good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>And especially in tricky cases.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Whisper&rsquo;s performance on like super tricky cases</p>
<p>and it does incredibly well.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A podcast is pretty simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like high quality audio</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re speaking usually pretty clearly.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what OpenAI&rsquo;s plans are either.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s always like fun projects basically.</p>
<p>And stable diffusion also is opening up</p>
<p>a huge amount of experimentation,</p>
<p>I would say in the visual realm</p>
<p>and generating images and videos and movies.</p>
<p>Ultimately.</p>
<p>Yeah, videos now.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s going to be pretty crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to almost certainly work</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be really interesting</p>
<p>when the cost of content creation is going to fall to zero.</p>
<p>You used to need a painter for a few months</p>
<p>to paint a thing.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s going to be speak to your phone</p>
<p>to get your video.</p>
<p>So Hollywood will start using that to generate scenes,</p>
<p>which completely opens up.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can make a movie like Avatar</p>
<p>eventually for under a million dollars.</p>
<p>Much less, maybe just by talking to your phone.</p>
<p>I mean, I know it sounds kind of crazy.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;d be some voting mechanism.</p>
<p>Like how do you have a&hellip;</p>
<p>Like would there be a show on Netflix</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generated completely automatically?</p>
<p>Semi-automatically.</p>
<p>Potentially, yeah.</p>
<p>And what does it look like also</p>
<p>when you can just generate it on demand</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s infinity of it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>All the synthetic content.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s humbling because we treat ourselves</p>
<p>as special for being able to generate art</p>
<p>and ideas and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>If that can be done in an automated way by AI.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fascinating to me how these&hellip;</p>
<p>The predictions of AI and what it&rsquo;s going to look like</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s going to be capable of</p>
<p>are completely inverted and wrong.</p>
<p>And sci-fi of 50s and 60s was just like totally not right.</p>
<p>They imagined AI as like super calculating theorem provers</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re getting things</p>
<p>that can talk to you about emotions.</p>
<p>They can do art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like weird.</p>
<p>Are you excited about that future?</p>
<p>Just AI&rsquo;s like hybrid systems,</p>
<p>heterogeneous systems of humans and AIs</p>
<p>talking about emotions.</p>
<p>Netflix and chill with an AI system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the Netflix thing you watch</p>
<p>is also generated by AI.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be interesting for sure.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>Well, the sad thing is your brain and mine</p>
<p>developed in a time where,</p>
<p>before Twitter, before the internet.</p>
<p>So I wonder people that are born inside of it</p>
<p>might have a different experience.</p>
<p>Like I, maybe you, will still resist it.</p>
<p>And the people born now will not.</p>
<p>Well, I do feel like humans are extremely malleable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life, Andre?</p>
<p>We talked about sort of the universe</p>
<p>having a conversation with us humans</p>
<p>or with the systems we create to try to answer.</p>
<p>For the creator of the universe to notice us,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to create systems that are loud enough</p>
<p>to answer back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like meaning of life for some people.</p>
<p>The first level answer I would say is</p>
<p>anyone can choose their own meaning of life</p>
<p>because we are a conscious entity and it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Number one.</p>
<p>But I do think that like a deeper meaning of life</p>
<p>if someone is interested is along the lines of like,</p>
<p>what the hell is all this?</p>
<p>And like, why?</p>
<p>And if you look into fundamental physics</p>
<p>and the quantum field theory and the standard model,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like very complicated.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this like 19 free parameters of our universe.</p>
<p>And like, what&rsquo;s going on with all this stuff?</p>
<p>And why is it here?</p>
<p>And can I hack it?</p>
<p>Can I work with it?</p>
<p>Is there a message for me?</p>
<p>Am I supposed to create a message?</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s some fundamental answers there.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s actually even like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t actually like really make dent in those</p>
<p>without more time.</p>
<p>And so to me also there&rsquo;s a big question</p>
<p>around just getting more time, honestly.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of like what I think about</p>
<p>quite a bit as well.</p>
<p>So kind of the ultimate, or at least first way</p>
<p>to sneak up to the why question is to try to escape</p>
<p>the system, the universe.</p>
<p>And then for that, you sort of backtrack and say,</p>
<p>okay, for that, that&rsquo;s gonna take a very long time.</p>
<p>So the why question boils down from an engineering</p>
<p>perspective to how do we extend?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s the question number one,</p>
<p>practically speaking, because you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna calculate the answer</p>
<p>to the deeper questions in time you have.</p>
<p>And that could be extending your own lifetime</p>
<p>or extending just the lifetime of human civilization.</p>
<p>Of whoever wants to.</p>
<p>Not many people might not want that.</p>
<p>But I think people who do want that,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably possible.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that people fully realize this.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like people think of death</p>
<p>as an inevitability.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, this is a physical system.</p>
<p>Some things go wrong.</p>
<p>It makes sense why things like this happen,</p>
<p>evolutionarily speaking.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s most certainly interventions that mitigate it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be interesting if death is eventually looked at</p>
<p>as a fascinating thing that used to happen to humans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unlikely.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s likely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s up to our imagination to try to predict</p>
<p>what the world without death looks like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to, I think the values will completely change.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really buy all these ideas that,</p>
<p>oh, without death, there&rsquo;s no meaning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothingness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t intuitively buy all those arguments.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s plenty of meaning,</p>
<p>plenty of things to learn.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interesting, exciting.</p>
<p>I want to know, I want to calculate.</p>
<p>I want to improve the condition</p>
<p>of all the humans and organisms that are alive.</p>
<p>Yeah, the way we find meaning might change.</p>
<p>There is a lot of humans, probably including myself,</p>
<p>that finds meaning in the finiteness of things.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s the only source of meaning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do think many people will go with that,</p>
<p>which I think is great.</p>
<p>I love the idea that people</p>
<p>can just choose their own adventure.</p>
<p>Like you are born as a conscious, free entity,</p>
<p>by default, I&rsquo;d like to think.</p>
<p>And you have your unalienable rights for life.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>Pursuit, I don&rsquo;t know if you have that.</p>
<p>In the nature, the landscape of happiness.</p>
<p>You can choose your own adventure, mostly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not fully true, but.</p>
<p>I still am pretty sure I&rsquo;m an NPC.</p>
<p>But an NPC can&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s an NPC.</p>
<p>There could be different degrees and levels of consciousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a more beautiful way to end it.</p>
<p>Andre, you&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really honored you would talk with me.</p>
<p>Everything you&rsquo;ve done for the machine learning world,</p>
<p>for the AI world, to just inspire people,</p>
<p>to educate millions of people, it&rsquo;s been great.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an honor, man.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Awesome, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Andre Karpathy.</p>

<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Samuel Carlin.</p>
<p>The purpose of models is not to fit the data,</p>
<p>but to sharpen the questions.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
