<p>Good morning and welcome.</p>
<p>We are so pleased that you could join us today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some really exciting product announcements to share with you.</p>
<p>As we all continue to make our way through these difficult times</p>
<p>and face the challenges that COVID-19 is causing</p>
<p>in our communities around the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so inspiring how people everywhere have adapted:</p>
<p>working remotely,</p>
<p>learning from home</p>
<p>and gathering virtually to stay close to family and friends.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been gratifying to see</p>
<p>the important role our products have played</p>
<p>in helping people come together, carry on and move forward.</p>
<p>We know that life won&rsquo;t always be like this,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all looking forward to better days.</p>
<p>Here at Apple, we feel a deep responsibility to keep innovating,</p>
<p>to continue making products that enrich people&rsquo;s lives in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re focusing on two products</p>
<p>that have played integral roles in people&rsquo;s everyday lives:</p>
<p>Apple Watch and iPad.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started with Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Apple Watch revolutionized what a watch can do.</p>
<p>If you think about it, for over 100 years,</p>
<p>the traditional watch really focused on just one thing: time.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s incredible what Apple Watch enables you to do</p>
<p>right from your wrist.</p>
<p>I use my Apple Watch and its amazing features throughout the day.</p>
<p>Before I go out in the morning, I check the weather.</p>
<p>At work, Apple Watch notifies me</p>
<p>with everything from messages to news alerts</p>
<p>and keeps me right on schedule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my best to stay in shape,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s great that Apple Watch keeps track of my workouts</p>
<p>and motivates me to close my rings.</p>
<p>When I get home, I use it to open the garage,</p>
<p>unlock my door and turn on the lights.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m ready to settle in,</p>
<p>I use Apple Watch to stream my favorite music.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so reassuring for millions of customers</p>
<p>that Apple Watch has introduced great health features</p>
<p>like heart monitoring, cycle tracking and fall detection</p>
<p>and even the ability to take an ECG.</p>
<p>No wonder Apple Watch is the most loved watch in the world.</p>
<p>I love reading the many messages I get every day from Apple Watch users</p>
<p>telling me how the watch has changed, and in some cases, saved their lives.</p>
<p>Like Ray from Texas.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d been experiencing pain in her stomach,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t think it was too serious.</p>
<p>When her Apple Watch alerted her to an elevated heart rate,</p>
<p>she realized it really was.</p>
<p>She went to the ER,</p>
<p>where it was determined she was in septic shock.</p>
<p>Ray got immediate intervention,</p>
<p>but she could have died without that warning from her Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Or Enrique from Spain,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s blind and uses his watch for everything from speaking the time</p>
<p>to reminding him when his appointments are</p>
<p>to calling taxis and helping him keep fit.</p>
<p>For Enrique, his Apple Watch has become an essential part of his day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like you to meet a few more of these people and hear their stories.</p>
<p>Dear Apple, my name is Kate.</p>
<p>It has always been my dream to become an Olympian,</p>
<p>but that can be hard with type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>It was just so many shots and finger pricks every single day.</p>
<p>I went from having to check my blood sugar manually every 20 minutes</p>
<p>to now all I have to do is just glance down at my wrist,</p>
<p>which reads the insulin pack attached to my side.</p>
<p>[crowd cheering]</p>
<p>I feel like I don&rsquo;t have type 1 when I&rsquo;m competing now.</p>
<p>[announcer] That is a US high-school record. That&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>My name is YJ.</p>
<p>Back in February of 2019,</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and hypertension.</p>
<p>The medications cost me $2,000 dollars a month, with insurance.</p>
<p>That was the tipping point for me.</p>
<p>I started tracking my exercises and started tracking my health,</p>
<p>all through my watch.</p>
<p>Almost 18 months later, I am not on any medications,</p>
<p>and I am in the best shape of my life.</p>
<p>My name is James.</p>
<p>We were sitting in the living room,</p>
<p>and I glanced down at my watch &lsquo;cause it kind of vibrated.</p>
<p>It flashed &ldquo;Increased Heart Rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time we got to the hospital, my heart rate was 206,</p>
<p>and she said, &ldquo;Sir, you&rsquo;re going into cardiac arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was 26.</p>
<p>I wanted my life,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t want my life just for me, but I wanted it for my family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful to still be here,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thankful for that device that saved me.</p>
<p>I really love hearing those stories</p>
<p>about how Apple Watch helps people and enriches their lives.</p>
<p>And healthcare providers, insurance companies and businesses</p>
<p>are also seeing the benefits of offering Apple Watch.</p>
<p>They know it can make a big difference</p>
<p>in the lives of their patients, customers and employees.</p>
<p>Recently, the Mount Sinai Health System in New York</p>
<p>launched the new Warrior Watch Study.</p>
<p>Using data from Apple Watch,</p>
<p>researchers are studying the impact of COVID</p>
<p>on the psychological well-being of frontline healthcare workers</p>
<p>by identifying early signs of stress</p>
<p>while also looking to predict infection before symptoms appear.</p>
<p>Singapore has one of the world&rsquo;s leading healthcare systems.</p>
<p>This fall, Singapore will become the first country</p>
<p>to leverage the benefits of Apple Watch</p>
<p>by offering incentives for people to use it to stay healthy and active.</p>
<p>Apple Watch helps people understand so much about their health and fitness</p>
<p>and to live a better day.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re going to take it even further.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Jeff to tell you what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>Apple Watch has made a profound impact</p>
<p>on so many of our customers&rsquo; lives, and we continue to be inspired.</p>
<p>And this year, watchOS 7 adds several important health features</p>
<p>that take advantage of the powerful technology in Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The new Sleep app uses the motion sensors to track your sleep.</p>
<p>Automatic handwashing detection</p>
<p>recognizes the motion and sound when washing your hands</p>
<p>and encourages you to continue for the recommended 20 seconds.</p>
<p>And watchOS 7 now uses your motion and heart rate</p>
<p>to measure a lower range of VO2 Max values.</p>
<p>Now, the American Heart Association recommends</p>
<p>routinely assessing cardio fitness levels,</p>
<p>and VO2 Max is the most accurate way to capture this.</p>
<p>The problem is, it&rsquo;s usually only measured in specialty clinics.</p>
<p>Well, watchOS 7 can now measure a full range of VO2 Max,</p>
<p>which is a powerful predictor of your overall health.</p>
<p>And coming later this year,</p>
<p>you can receive a notification if your VO2 Max drops to those lower levels.</p>
<p>Each year, Apple Watch raises the bar,</p>
<p>adding new features and technology that improve our lives.</p>
<p>This year, Apple Watch takes another big leap forward.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m excited to show it to you now.</p>
<p>This is the new Apple Watch Series 6.</p>
<p>The perfect combination of powerful features and beautiful design.</p>
<p>Series 6 is our most colorful lineup ever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new blue aluminum case,</p>
<p>this updated classic gold stainless steel finish,</p>
<p>a new gray-black stainless steel called Graphite</p>
<p>and for the first time, a stunning new Apple Watch (PRODUCT)RED.</p>
<p>Now on the inside, Series 6 is packed with incredible technology,</p>
<p>including a new health sensor that enables an amazing new capability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>With Apple Watch Series 6,</p>
<p>you can measure your blood oxygen right from your wrist.</p>
<p>The new health sensor in Series 6</p>
<p>shines red and infrared light onto your wrist</p>
<p>and measures the amount of light reflected back.</p>
<p>Advanced algorithms use this data to calculate the color of your blood,</p>
<p>which indicates the amount of oxygen present.</p>
<p>The new Blood Oxygen app lets you take a measurement in just 15 seconds.</p>
<p>[watch chimes]</p>
<p>And Series 6 also captures periodic background readings</p>
<p>and stores them in your Health app.</p>
<p>So if you wear your Apple Watch to bed,</p>
<p>it can record background measurements while you sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Sumbul</p>
<p>to talk more about blood oxygen and its importance to your health.</p>
<p>Blood oxygen saturation, also known as SpO2, is like a vital sign.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a key measurement that contains</p>
<p>critical information about your breathing and circulation.</p>
<p>Apple Watch is already a powerful health tool,</p>
<p>with apps that measure heart rate and heart rhythm.</p>
<p>And now, adding blood oxygen</p>
<p>brings another valuable health measurement to users.</p>
<p>Blood oxygen and pulse oximetry</p>
<p>are terms that we&rsquo;ve heard a lot about during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>As you breathe, your heart and lungs work together</p>
<p>to deliver oxygen throughout your body.</p>
<p>Blood oxygen saturation is an indication of how well this system is functioning</p>
<p>and of your overall respiratory and cardiac health.</p>
<p>And pulse oximetry is how you measure it.</p>
<p>Now, the Blood Oxygen app on Series 6 lets you measure your blood oxygen</p>
<p>for fitness and wellness purposes from your wrist</p>
<p>anywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>This is a great new tool for your overall well-being.</p>
<p>And to enable future medical discoveries,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re launching three new health research studies</p>
<p>to learn how longitudinal blood oxygen measurements,</p>
<p>along with other health metrics from Apple Watch,</p>
<p>can help manage conditions that affect the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>First, to study how to better manage and control asthma</p>
<p>using physiological signals from Apple Watch,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re collaborating with the pulmonary experts</p>
<p>at the University of California, Irvine and Anthem.</p>
<p>Second, to learn more about how metrics, including blood oxygen,</p>
<p>can be used to manage heart failure,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re partnering with one of the largest research organizations in North America,</p>
<p>the University Health Network,</p>
<p>and the investigators at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>And finally, as we all continue to learn more about COVID</p>
<p>and understand the interplay with influenza,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re partnering with the investigators of the Seattle Flu Study</p>
<p>and faculty from the University of Washington School of Medicine.</p>
<p>We will explore how changes in blood oxygen and heart rate</p>
<p>could be early signals of the onset of these respiratory conditions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new blood oxygen feature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited to bring this important new health capability to our users.</p>
<p>Now, back to Jeff to tell you more about the new Apple Watch Series 6.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re measuring blood oxygen,</p>
<p>making a phone call on your watch</p>
<p>or simply checking your Activity Rings,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all made possible by Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>Inside Series 6 is our sixth-generation System in Package.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a purpose-built design that&rsquo;s absolutely unique in the industry.</p>
<p>It includes a high performance dual-core processor</p>
<p>based on the A13 Bionic in iPhone 11</p>
<p>but optimized for Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The S6 is up to 20% faster than the previous generation.</p>
<p>Series 6 also has great new features</p>
<p>that are perfect for when you&rsquo;re out and about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s head outside and take a look.</p>
<p>Because of its energy-efficient design,</p>
<p>Series 6 has an even better Always-On Display,</p>
<p>making it easier to read your watch on sunny days</p>
<p>without having to wake the display.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s two-and-a-half times brighter outdoors</p>
<p>when your wrist is down.</p>
<p>Series 6 also features a new always-on altimeter</p>
<p>that provides continuous elevation throughout the day.</p>
<p>So on your next hike,</p>
<p>you can see your elevation change in real time,</p>
<p>right on your watch face.</p>
<p>And at any time, no matter where you are,</p>
<p>you can measure your blood oxygen saturation</p>
<p>right from your wrist.</p>
<p>[watch chimes]</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about watch faces.</p>
<p>The watch face is fundamental to the Apple Watch experience.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re taking faces further this year,</p>
<p>starting with some great new designs.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d like to share them with you now.</p>
<p>[Dye] The watch face is the most powerful and personal aspect of Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Our approach to face design begins with a deep respect</p>
<p>for the history of timekeeping.</p>
<p>We combined that sense of craft</p>
<p>with the powerful technologies and capabilities of Apple Watch</p>
<p>to create these new faces.</p>
<p>The GMT face shows multiple time zones at once</p>
<p>and takes into account where you are.</p>
<p>The Count-up face lets you start tracking elapsed time</p>
<p>from any given point.</p>
<p>And inspired by classic racing watches,</p>
<p>the Chronograph Pro face features multiple time scales,</p>
<p>including a tachymeter to measure speed</p>
<p>based on time traveled over a set distance.</p>
<p>In the Typograph face,</p>
<p>numerals can be displayed in three custom type styles</p>
<p>and four different scripts.</p>
<p>Every combination is tailored to fit the face perfectly.</p>
<p>We also collaborated with the artist Geoff McFetridge</p>
<p>to create a unique piece of art for your watch.</p>
<p>There are millions of combinations,</p>
<p>and a different one animates when you raise your wrist.</p>
<p>The Memoji face brings your favorite Memoji to your watch.</p>
<p>Each one moves and reacts to your touch.</p>
<p>And with the Stripes face,</p>
<p>you can show your pride in who you are, support your favorite team</p>
<p>or even match what you&rsquo;re wearing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so proud to add to the legacy of Apple Watch faces</p>
<p>with this new collection.</p>
<p>In watchOS 7, we also gave developers new tools</p>
<p>to build even more specialized watch faces.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re into surfing, there&rsquo;s a watch face for that,</p>
<p>with apps like Dawn Patrol to check surf conditions.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re into photography, there&rsquo;s a watch face for that,</p>
<p>with apps like Lumy to help you track the sun&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re a healthcare provider, there&rsquo;s a watch face for that,</p>
<p>with apps like Notable to see your upcoming appointments.</p>
<p>Watch faces have always been a great way to personalize your Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Another is interchangeable bands.</p>
<p>Now, traditional watch bands have a clasp or a buckle,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re limited to a few preset sizes for fit.</p>
<p>Well, today we&rsquo;re excited to introduce something completely different.</p>
<p>We call it the Solo Loop.</p>
<p>The Solo Loop is remarkably simple.</p>
<p>No clasp, no buckle, no overlapping parts.</p>
<p>Just one continuous piece.</p>
<p>Made from custom liquid silicone,</p>
<p>the Solo Loop is stretchable, so you can easily slip it on and off your wrist.</p>
<p>It looks great, and it&rsquo;s durable, and it&rsquo;s swimproof,</p>
<p>so it can go anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available in a range of sizes</p>
<p>so you can find your most comfortable fit.</p>
<p>And it comes in seven fantastic colors.</p>
<p>This new band style is so comfortable,</p>
<p>we did another version called&hellip;</p>
<p>the Braided Solo Loop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made from 100% recycled yarn</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s meticulously braided with ultrathin silicone threads,</p>
<p>and it will be available in five colors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also offering a new take on the leather band</p>
<p>with the new Leather Link,</p>
<p>with no loop-back or clasp of any kind.</p>
<p>There are also great new updates for Apple Watch Nike,</p>
<p>with fun new Sport Band and Sport Loop colors</p>
<p>plus a new Nike watch face.</p>
<p>And for Apple Watch Herm√®s, we&rsquo;re introducing the new Attelage band,</p>
<p>in both single tour&hellip;</p>
<p>and double tour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Apple Watch Series 6,</p>
<p>the most advanced Apple Watch ever.</p>
<p>We think you&rsquo;re gonna love all the amazing new features.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re doing two additional things</p>
<p>to make Apple Watch available to even more people.</p>
<p>And the first is an entirely new way for families to use Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Deidre to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>Apple Watch is essential for staying connected to those you love,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s a child or an older adult.</p>
<p>Right now, Apple Watch needs to pair with an iPhone,</p>
<p>which is something they might not have.</p>
<p>This is why we&rsquo;re excited to introduce Family Setup.</p>
<p>With Family Setup, you can use your iPhone to pair watches for your children</p>
<p>or older members in your household who don&rsquo;t have their own phones.</p>
<p>And they will have their own phone number and account.</p>
<p>Let me show you how it works.</p>
<p>Family Setup enables greater independence for your kids or older parents.</p>
<p>And you have the comfort of knowing they&rsquo;re just a call away.</p>
<p>You get the safety and communication features that technology can deliver</p>
<p>in a device that can be managed responsibly.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>you can specify which contacts your kids can communicate with</p>
<p>when using Messages and more.</p>
<p>And you can set up automatic location notifications.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s Grandma&rsquo;s house, school or basketball practice&hellip;</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the reassurance your child is exactly where you expect them to be.</p>
<p>To help them stay active, kids can now track Move minutes</p>
<p>and use all of the other great features of Activity and Workout</p>
<p>in a way that works best for them.</p>
<p>Kids can create a Memoji with just their watch</p>
<p>and share it as stickers in Messages or in the new Memoji watch face.</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re learning at home or in the classroom,</p>
<p>the new Schooltime mode helps kids stay focused</p>
<p>with Do Not Disturb, restricted interaction</p>
<p>and this distinctive look, which teachers or parents can recognize at a glance.</p>
<p>These are just some of the ways</p>
<p>Family Setup provides kids and older adults</p>
<p>with the powerful and unique benefits of Apple Watch,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have an iPhone.</p>
<p>Family Setup requires a cellular model of Apple Watch Series 4 and later</p>
<p>and will be available at launch with these carrier partners&hellip;</p>
<p>in these regions around the world,</p>
<p>with more coming later this year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Family Setup. Back to Jeff.</p>
<p>We think Family Setup will keep families more connected,</p>
<p>giving kids greater independence and agency</p>
<p>and you more peace of mind.</p>
<p>The second thing we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to make Apple Watch available to even more people</p>
<p>is to create a new model that combines elements of Series 6 design</p>
<p>with the most essential features of Apple Watch,</p>
<p>all at a more affordable price.</p>
<p>We call it Apple Watch SE.</p>
<p>Apple Watch SE has the features customers love.</p>
<p>It has everything you need to stay connected,</p>
<p>be more active and keep an eye on your health.</p>
<p>And like Series 6,</p>
<p>Apple Watch SE uses our largest and most advanced watch display,</p>
<p>allowing you to see so much more at a glance.</p>
<p>More information and apps on your watch face.</p>
<p>More in Messages, Calendar and Maps.</p>
<p>And larger and easier-to-read metrics while you&rsquo;re working out.</p>
<p>And for fast access to information and apps,</p>
<p>Apple Watch SE uses the S5 chip,</p>
<p>for up to two times faster performance than Series 3.</p>
<p>And staying connected is even easier with the cellular models,</p>
<p>which allow you to make phone calls, send messages and more,</p>
<p>even without your phone.</p>
<p>And with Family Setup,</p>
<p>cellular models of Apple Watch SE will also be great for kids.</p>
<p>Customers love using Apple Watch for fitness and working out,</p>
<p>and Apple Watch SE has the same accelerometer, gyroscope,</p>
<p>compass and altimeter as Series 6.</p>
<p>And because it has the latest motion sensors,</p>
<p>Apple Watch SE also supports fall detection,</p>
<p>a feature that&rsquo;s made a lifesaving difference</p>
<p>for many Apple Watch wearers.</p>
<p>With all of these features and more,</p>
<p>including the new capabilities in watchOS 7,</p>
<p>we think Apple Watch SE will be the perfect watch for many new customers.</p>
<p>Apple Watch SE starts at just $279.</p>
<p>In addition, we&rsquo;re announcing Apple Card Financing for Apple Watch,</p>
<p>so customers can easily pay across 24 monthly payments.</p>
<p>Apple Watch Series 6,</p>
<p>with the breakthrough new blood oxygen sensor,</p>
<p>starts at just $399.</p>
<p>And Series 3 continues at its great entry price of just $199.</p>
<p>With three great Apple Watch models to choose from,</p>
<p>there really is an Apple Watch for everyone.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about what Apple Watch is doing to protect the environment.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s commitment to the environment spans everything we do,</p>
<p>from how we design our products to the materials that go in them</p>
<p>to how they&rsquo;re manufactured.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Lisa to share some of the many things Apple is doing</p>
<p>to reduce our environmental footprint.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re proud that all of our corporate operations worldwide are carbon neutral.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done it by replacing dirty energy with clean renewable power.</p>
<p>All of our offices, retail stores and data centers</p>
<p>run on 100% renewable energy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also proud that we&rsquo;ve cut our comprehensive carbon footprint</p>
<p>by 35% since 2015.</p>
<p>And you may have heard</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now taking our environmental commitment even further,</p>
<p>starting with a promise.</p>
<p>By 2030, Apple will be 100% carbon neutral</p>
<p>for our entire end-to-end footprint,</p>
<p>including our supply chain and products.</p>
<p>To keep our promise,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re focusing on not just the energy we use</p>
<p>but the materials needed to make our products.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Beginning last year, our aluminum watch cases</p>
<p>are made with 100% recycled aluminum.</p>
<p>And for Series 6, we&rsquo;re now using</p>
<p>100% recycled rare earth elements and tungsten</p>
<p>in the Taptic Engine.</p>
<p>And we go to great lengths</p>
<p>to make sure our products are free of harmful chemicals.</p>
<p>Like all of our products,</p>
<p>Apple Watch is free of BFR, PVC, beryllium and mercury,</p>
<p>and the display glass is made without arsenic.</p>
<p>And all of the fiber in our packaging comes from recycled sources</p>
<p>or responsibly managed forests.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not what we make but what we don&rsquo;t make that counts.</p>
<p>We know that customers have been accumulating USB power adapters,</p>
<p>and that producing millions of unneeded adapters</p>
<p>consumes resources and adds to our carbon footprint.</p>
<p>So this year, we are removing the USB power adapter from Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also helping our Apple Watch manufacturing partners</p>
<p>transition to renewable energy.</p>
<p>That, combined with removing the power adapter,</p>
<p>will result in eliminating the carbon equivalent</p>
<p>of over 50,000 cars from our roads per year.</p>
<p>We have lots more to do, and we&rsquo;ll have lots more to share</p>
<p>in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>Now back to Jeff.</p>
<p>These actions are significant and lasting,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m proud of the great work Apple is doing to protect our planet.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s our lineup.</p>
<p>Apple Watch Series 6 with the new blood oxygen sensor,</p>
<p>the most advanced Apple Watch yet.</p>
<p>And the very capable and affordable Apple Watch SE.</p>
<p>You can order both today, and availability starts this Friday.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the new Apple Watch Series 6,</p>
<p>we created a video to show you just how far the watch has come.</p>
<p>And here it is.</p>
<p>[woman narrating] Imagine a future where one day,</p>
<p>machine learning will give you the power to track your sleep.</p>
<p>-Imagine&ndash; -[woman] Excuse me, ma&rsquo;am?</p>
<p>[narrator] Yes, can I help you?</p>
<p>Yeah, this already does that.</p>
<p>[narrator] Oh. I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Well, now you do.</p>
<p>Okay. Let&rsquo;s try this again. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll start again.</p>
<p>Imagine one day, a tiny device with an optical sensor</p>
<p>will send you an alert if your heart rate is too low.</p>
<p>[woman 2] Psst.</p>
<p>Yes? What?</p>
<p>-[whispering] It already does that. -What?</p>
<p>Oh. Okay. Well, how about we&rsquo;ll send you an alert if your heart rate is too high?</p>
<p>It already does that.</p>
<p>All right. Let&rsquo;s try something new.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll send you an alert if you&rsquo;re someplace that&rsquo;s too loud.</p>
<p>-[watch chimes] -I just received one of those alerts.</p>
<p>Really? [shouting] Well, you should probably find a quieter place, sir.</p>
<p>You should probably mind your own business.</p>
<p>[groans] Okay.</p>
<p>-Imagine one day in the future&ndash; -Hold on.</p>
<p>-No, no, no! Let me finish. -One second.</p>
<p>-You&rsquo;ll be able to take an ECG&ndash; -It already does that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It already does that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-I heard that. -Good.</p>
<p>What about continuously track your elevation? Does it do that?</p>
<p>-Does that. -Right. Got it.</p>
<p>-Does that. -Thank you.</p>
<p>-Does that. -Yep. Heard it the first time.</p>
<p>-Encourages you to stay fit. -Does that.</p>
<p>[watch chimes]</p>
<p>Okay. I get it. You&rsquo;re fit.</p>
<p>Uh, I don&rsquo;t know. Will it automatically call 911</p>
<p>if a bear chases you off a cliff and you take a hard fall? Huh?</p>
<p>-Yeah. Already does that. -Seriously?</p>
<p>Yeah. Seriously.</p>
<p>You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay. I got it. Let&rsquo;s go from the top!</p>
<p>Imagine a day, a future&ndash;</p>
<p>Imagine a future, one day, tiny device, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>that uses red and infrared light to measure your blood oxygen level.</p>
<p>Yes, what?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. Don&rsquo;t you dare say it.</p>
<p>-[no audible dialogue] -I&rsquo;m sorry. I can&rsquo;t hear you!</p>
<p>[watch chimes]</p>
<p>Very cute.</p>
<p>Well, that was fun.</p>
<p>Since the beginning,</p>
<p>one of the most profound impacts Apple Watch has had</p>
<p>is helping people be more active.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on something</p>
<p>that will motivate and inspire you even more on your fitness journey.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Jay to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>Being more active is one of the most important things we can do for our health.</p>
<p>So over the years, we built a range of features on the Apple Watch</p>
<p>designed to motivate a wide variety of users.</p>
<p>We hear from people who&rsquo;ve become healthier</p>
<p>just by closing their Activity Rings each day</p>
<p>and friends and family who are able to motivate each other</p>
<p>and stay connected even from far away with Activity Sharing.</p>
<p>And then there are our most competitive Apple Watch users,</p>
<p>who love earning awards and challenging each other to get fit.</p>
<p>One of the Apple Watch&rsquo;s most popular apps is the Workout app,</p>
<p>which has been finely tuned with powerful algorithms</p>
<p>that accurately track the most important metrics</p>
<p>for all the workouts you do.</p>
<p>This year we wanted to push</p>
<p>the Apple Watch workout experience even further,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re creating amazing workouts with incredible music,</p>
<p>delivered by the world&rsquo;s best trainers.</p>
<p>This is the first fitness service built around Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d like to show it to you now.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Go Time&rdquo; by TYPO.S playing]</p>

<p>Introducing Apple Fitness+,</p>
<p>a new service for Apple Watch designed to inspire you to get fit and stay fit.</p>
<p>The entire Fitness+ experience is powered by the Apple Watch</p>
<p>in some really cool ways.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how it works.</p>
<p>Apple Watch owners love seeing all their metrics right from their wrist</p>
<p>during a workout.</p>
<p>The watch&rsquo;s sensors makes it possible to see your heart rate,</p>
<p>calories burned, pace and distance.</p>
<p>And that data helps keep you motivated and on track, which is awesome.</p>
<p>With Fitness+, you simply choose the workout you want to do</p>
<p>from the catalog of videos on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.</p>
<p>And when you start the video,</p>
<p>it automatically starts the correct workout</p>
<p>in your Apple Watch Workout app.</p>
<p>And it sends those metrics in real time</p>
<p>right to the screen you&rsquo;re viewing the workout.</p>
<p>So you have all of your data on your wrist and on the screen in front of you,</p>
<p>and your metrics come to life to keep you motivated.</p>
<p>For example, when the trainer reminds you to check your heart rate,</p>
<p>your numbers get larger, making it easy to see the details you need.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in the middle of a tough interval,</p>
<p>you see a countdown timer</p>
<p>to motivate you to push through every last second.</p>
<p>Your Activity Rings are also right on the screen,</p>
<p>so you can see how your workout is helping you make progress</p>
<p>towards closing your rings for the day.</p>
<p>And if you happen to close one of your rings</p>
<p>in the middle of your workout, you won&rsquo;t miss the celebration.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see it in real time, right on the screen.</p>
<p>When the workout is over, you get a comprehensive summary.</p>
<p>And all of that data captured from your watch&rsquo;s sensors</p>
<p>is shown right on the summary screen:</p>
<p>calories burned, average heart rate, distance, pace,</p>
<p>even your current Activity Rings.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a lot more to the experience.</p>
<p>Fitness+ is launching with the most popular workout types,</p>
<p>so there is something for everyone:</p>
<p>yoga&hellip;</p>
<p>cycling&hellip;</p>
<p>dance&hellip;</p>
<p>treadmill walk and treadmill run&hellip;</p>
<p>strength&hellip;</p>
<p>core&hellip;</p>
<p>HIIT&hellip;</p>
<p>rowing&hellip;</p>
<p>and even mindful cooldowns.</p>
<p>You can do the workouts with any brand of equipment,</p>
<p>and many of the workouts require just a set of dumbbells</p>
<p>or no equipment at all.</p>
<p>Of course, you can do them wherever it&rsquo;s convenient for you:</p>
<p>at home&hellip;</p>
<p>the gym&hellip;</p>
<p>outside&hellip;</p>
<p>or even when you&rsquo;re traveling.</p>
<p>We think the flexibility to do the workout you love</p>

<p>whether you&rsquo;re working out or not.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re brand-new to fitness,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s been a while since you&rsquo;ve worked out,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an absolute beginner program built right in.</p>
<p>The program will help you get started,</p>
<p>learn the basics of movement and fitness,</p>
<p>and get you safely ready for the studio workouts.</p>
<p>We wanted to make it easy to find all the workouts you love</p>

<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn our attention to iPad.</p>
<p>I love my iPad because it is such an incredibly versatile device.</p>
<p>Powerful and easy to use,</p>
<p>it enables all of us to do so many meaningful things every day.</p>
<p>And now more than ever, iPad has become even more important,</p>
<p>keeping us close to the ones we love when we can&rsquo;t be there in person,</p>
<p>helping students learn remotely,</p>
<p>helping people express and share their creativity,</p>
<p>reshaping how the world communicates.</p>
<p>And iPad is providing a critical lifeline for doctors, nurses and patients.</p>
<p>Its versatility is what makes iPad such an essential device.</p>
<p>With the power of the App Store and over a million iPad apps,</p>
<p>the iPad can do whatever you need it to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inspired to see how iPad&rsquo;s impact has been felt across the world.</p>
<p>This year marks the ten years since we shipped our very first iPad.</p>
<p>And in that time, it has become</p>
<p>one of the most successful consumer electronics products ever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now sold over 500 million iPads to customers around the world.</p>
<p>And more and more new customers are just discovering iPad</p>
<p>for the very first time.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>more than half of our iPad customers are buying their very first iPad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just incredible!</p>
<p>And users love their iPads.</p>
<p>iPad has been ranked number one in customer satisfaction</p>
<p>for ten straight years&ndash;</p>
<p>every year since it launched.</p>
<p>Our users are doing more than ever with iPad,</p>
<p>so we continue to push iPad forward.</p>
<p>This is a big year for iPad.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we made some great updates to the iPad Pro,</p>
<p>including the A12Z chip,</p>
<p>new pro camera system,</p>
<p>LiDAR Scanner and so much more.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re updating the rest of our full-size iPad lineup,</p>
<p>starting with our most popular iPad.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Ted to tell you more about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly proud of the role iPad is playing in the lives of so many people.</p>
<p>Users love our iPad 7th generation</p>
<p>because it delivers a beautiful 10.2-inch Retina display</p>
<p>with support for Apple Pencil and the full-size Smart Keyboard</p>
<p>all in a thin, light and affordable design.</p>
<p>And our customers love all the things they can do with it,</p>
<p>from taking notes as they learn something new</p>
<p>to playing their favorite game.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;re taking its beloved design</p>
<p>and cranking up the performance with this&hellip;</p>
<p>the new iPad 8th generation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more capable than ever,</p>
<p>and it starts with the A12 Bionic.</p>
<p>This chip is a powerhouse.</p>
<p>It features a powerful CPU and superfast GPU.</p>
<p>Compared to the already fast chip in last year&rsquo;s iPad,</p>
<p>it has a 40% faster CPU</p>
<p>and delivers a massive two-times jump in graphics.</p>
<p>This extra performance is great</p>
<p>for everything from working with high-resolution content</p>
<p>to immersive gaming experiences.</p>
<p>And compared to the competition over the last year, it&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>This new iPad with the A12 Bionic is up to two times faster</p>
<p>than the top-selling Windows laptop,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up to three times faster than the top-selling Android tablet,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s up to a whopping six times faster than the top-selling Chromebook.</p>
<p>iPad leaves the competition in the dust.</p>
<p>And all that power is delivered in a thin and light design</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super portable with great cameras and all-day battery life.</p>
<p>Now, our A-series chips are more than a CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>They include powerful custom technologies,</p>
<p>like the Neural Engine for machine learning,</p>
<p>which comes to our most popular iPad for the very first time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s capable of processing up to five trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>And it powers some magical experiences on iPad,</p>
<p>like allowing you to instantly transform the color of your photos</p>
<p>or even analyze your tennis game</p>
<p>and provide real-time stats like ball speed and body positioning.</p>
<p>Altogether, the A12 Bionic takes performance to the next level</p>
<p>and makes iPad more powerful than ever.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about accessories.</p>
<p>They expand the versatility of iPad.</p>
<p>iPad 8th gen works with the full-size Smart Keyboard</p>
<p>and keyboards from Logitech,</p>
<p>like the Combo Touch with trackpad</p>
<p>and the Rugged Combo that&rsquo;s so important for schools.</p>
<p>And of course, this new iPad works with one of our most beloved accessories,</p>
<p>Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>With its incredible precision and low latency,</p>
<p>plus features like pressure sensitivity and tilt,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the gold standard for creativity</p>
<p>and enables artists to bring their vision to life.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen it become an essential tool to journal and take detailed notes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re blown away by what we&rsquo;ve seen people create</p>
<p>with Apple Pencil on iPad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really nothing else like it.</p>
<p>And taking the Apple Pencil experience to a whole new level is iPadOS 14,</p>
<p>which adds powerful new pencil capabilities</p>
<p>and other new features as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see it in action.</p>
<p>iPadOS 14 makes iPad even more intuitive, fun and productive,</p>
<p>because you can get your work done just about anywhere.</p>
<p>Handwritten text is just as powerful as typed text.</p>
<p>iPadOS even understands what you write,</p>
<p>letting you take quick actions with just a tap.</p>
<p>As you sketch,</p>
<p>shape recognition helps you draw perfect circles, stars and more.</p>
<p>Smart Selection understands the difference between handwriting and drawings,</p>
<p>making it easy to select only what you want</p>
<p>and paste your handwritten notes as typed text into another app.</p>
<p>New compact UIs mean you can stay focused on the task at hand.</p>
<p>And we know, once you start using Apple Pencil,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna want to put it away.</p>
<p>So, we have Scribble,</p>
<p>which lets you handwrite into any text field,</p>
<p>even straight into numbers&hellip;</p>
<p>or to add a final thought to that document you&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>
<p>The new iPad and the power of iPadOS 14 are an amazing combination,</p>
<p>making it possible to express your ideas however you want to,</p>
<p>wherever you are.</p>
<p>With iPadOS 14,</p>
<p>the already amazing experience of Apple Pencil gets even better.</p>
<p>These powerful handwriting and note-taking features</p>
<p>join a host of other new features</p>
<p>that continue to push what&rsquo;s possible on iPad.</p>
<p>And it all runs beautifully on the new iPad 8th generation</p>
<p>with its 10.2-inch Retina display,</p>
<p>huge performance boost from the A12 Bionic,</p>
<p>keyboard and pencil support,</p>
<p>great cameras and so much more.</p>
<p>And it starts at just $329.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just $299 for our education customers.</p>
<p>Nothing else delivers this level of performance and capability</p>
<p>at such an affordable price.</p>
<p>Customers can order iPad 8th generation today,</p>
<p>and it will be available starting this Friday.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>iPad 8th generation, with its huge boost in performance,</p>
<p>and the incredible features in iPadOS 14</p>
<p>will enable even more people to do more amazing things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<p>As I told you, we&rsquo;re updating our entire full-size lineup.</p>
<p>So that brings us to iPad Air.</p>
<p>iPad Air was designed to deliver pro features at a very affordable price.</p>
<p>And today we are thrilled to introduce</p>
<p>an all-new, completely redesigned iPad Air.</p>
<p>And here it is.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Heybb!&rdquo; by binki playing]</p>
<p>This is the new iPad Air.</p>
<p>And to tell you all about it, I&rsquo;d like to hand it over to Laura.</p>
<p>The new iPad Air starts with a gorgeous design.</p>
<p>The all-new thin and light enclosure and narrow border design</p>
<p>features a beautiful all-screen display.</p>
<p>Each element of iPad Air is meticulously crafted,</p>
<p>from the precisely machined top button</p>
<p>to the sculpted detail around the camera.</p>
<p>And the new iPad Air design comes in five gorgeous colors,</p>
<p>including a new rose gold, green and sky blue finish.</p>
<p>Our customers are going to love these colors.</p>
<p>And this new design features a stunning Liquid Retina display.</p>
<p>In the same footprint as the previous Air,</p>
<p>the new iPad Air features a larger, 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display</p>
<p>with a resolution of 2360 by 1640.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s over 3.8 million pixels</p>
<p>for extra-crisp text and photos.</p>
<p>And, it has advanced display technologies like full lamination,</p>
<p>wide color, True Tone</p>
<p>and an anti-reflective coating</p>
<p>that, combined, deliver an amazing visual experience.</p>
<p>To give our customers this beautiful all-screen design</p>
<p>meant finding a new home for one of the most popular features:</p>
<p>Touch ID.</p>
<p>So we designed a next-generation Touch ID</p>
<p>and integrated it right into the top button.</p>
<p>This provides convenient and secure authentication</p>
<p>while allowing the display to extend on all sides.</p>
<p>This is the smallest authentication sensor we have ever designed,</p>
<p>and it delivers the same performance, ease of use and security</p>
<p>you know and trust from Touch ID.</p>
<p>The technology under the button is really amazing.</p>
<p>It uses a sapphire crystal lens and next-generation custom sensor</p>
<p>that more efficiently captures the details of a fingerprint.</p>
<p>And it uses a faster Secure Enclave</p>
<p>to more quickly authenticate the fingerprint data.</p>
<p>And using it is as simple as ever:</p>
<p>just touch the top button to unlock your iPad,</p>
<p>log in to apps or use Apple Pay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fast, easy and secure.</p>
<p>Another reason customers love iPad Air is its performance.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re debuting an incredibly powerful new chip</p>
<p>which is going to give the new Air a huge leap in performance.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Tim Millet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited to tell you about the powerful new chip</p>
<p>we built into the new iPad Air:</p>
<p>our latest A-series processor, A14 Bionic.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build chips with industry-leading performance,</p>
<p>powerful custom technologies and extremely efficient use of energy</p>
<p>to make every one of our products best in class.</p>
<p>One way we do this is by aggressively adopting</p>
<p>cutting-edge silicon process technology year after year.</p>
<p>And now with A14, we&rsquo;ll be the first in the industry</p>
<p>to use the breakthrough five-nanometer process technology.</p>
<p>The incredibly small scale of this process challenges the laws of physics.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re talking about a scale so small,</p>
<p>the dimensions of these five-nanometer transistors are measured in atoms.</p>
<p>This means we were able to pack 11.8 billion transistors into A14.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an increase of nearly 40% over our seven-nanometer chip.</p>
<p>We use these additional transistors to deliver new features,</p>
<p>increased power efficiency and increased performance</p>
<p>in nearly every aspect of the chip.</p>
<p>A14 Bionic includes a big update to our CPU.</p>
<p>Our architecture runs more instructions in parallel,</p>
<p>resulting in great performance at lower power.</p>
<p>And it integrates large, high-performance caches</p>
<p>sized to meet the needs of the most demanding applications.</p>
<p>For A14&rsquo;s powerful new six-core design,</p>
<p>this results in an enormous 40% increase in CPU performance</p>
<p>compared to the previous iPad Air.</p>
<p>A14 also features our newest GPU architecture,</p>
<p>scaled to deliver the maximum sustainable performance</p>
<p>at the lowest possible power&ndash;</p>
<p>an approach that also allows us to deliver industry-leading peak performance</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s needed most.</p>
<p>For A14, our new four-core design delivers</p>
<p>a 30% increase in graphics performance as well.</p>
<p>And when you compare the new iPad Air with A14</p>
<p>to the best-selling laptop in its price range,</p>
<p>a device nearly three times thicker and four times heavier,</p>
<p>the new iPad Air has up to two times faster graphics performance</p>
<p>in its incredibly thin and light design.</p>
<p>So for customers using iPad Air for performance-intensive apps</p>
<p>like editing 4K videos, creating works of art</p>
<p>or playing immersive games,</p>
<p>the incredible performance of A14 can handle them all with ease.</p>
<p>In addition to the blazing-fast CPU and GPU,</p>
<p>A14 is loaded with custom technologies that drive the unique iPad experience,</p>
<p>like a much faster Neural Engine,</p>
<p>which will make iPad Air more powerful for machine learning.</p>
<p>By doubling the number of cores to build a 16-core architecture,</p>
<p>the Neural Engine in A14 is capable of executing</p>
<p>an amazing 11 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>This increases ML performance by up to two times over the previous generation.</p>
<p>In addition, our CPU is further optimized</p>
<p>with second-generation machine learning accelerators,</p>
<p>which come to iPad for the first time</p>
<p>and accelerate the matrix multiplication frequently used in ML computations</p>
<p>at up to ten times faster than the previous Air.</p>
<p>Now, the combination of the new Neural Engine,</p>
<p>the CPU ML accelerators and our high-performance GPU</p>
<p>deliver breakthrough machine learning capabilities</p>
<p>to elevate apps built on Core ML to an entirely new level of performance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new A14 Bionic.</p>
<p>It delivers big performance updates for the CPU and GPU,</p>
<p>makes iPad Air much more powerful for machine learning</p>
<p>and also features the latest ISP for higher-quality videos and photos</p>
<p>and even faster Secure Enclave for Touch ID.</p>
<p>This is by far the most advanced chip we&rsquo;ve ever made,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re thrilled to bring it to the new iPad Air.</p>
<p>Now back to you, Laura.</p>
<p>Wow, the A14 is a huge leap forward in performance.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve worked with a number of developers</p>
<p>to see what they can do with the new iPad Air.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Karim Morsy. I&rsquo;m a developer of djay Pro AI.</p>
<p>djay Pro AI is an app that brings all the tools of a professional DJ to iPad.</p>
<p>The A14 Bionic allows us to build intelligent features into the app.</p>
<p>You touch the record, and then you start scratching.</p>
<p>You can actually scratch in the air.</p>
<p>It just blows our mind that this is possible now.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Alexey from Pixonic, developer of the game War Robots.</p>
<p>The A14 Bionic chip allows us to deliver console-level graphics</p>
<p>on a device you can hold in your hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite amazing to have a real-time, six-versus-six multiplayer game</p>
<p>running on iPad at 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>For example, the textures are much more detailed,</p>
<p>the shadows are dynamic,</p>
<p>and reflections are more realistic.</p>
<p>It looks amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrius, and we&rsquo;re from Pixelmator.</p>
<p>Pixelmator Photo is a photo editing app for enhancing photos.</p>
<p>So I think everyone&rsquo;s seen the movies where somebody&rsquo;s pointing at a screen,</p>
<p>and goes, &ldquo;Okay, zoom in on that. Now, enhance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ve brought that to iPad.</p>
<p>The Apple Neural Engine allows us to build functionality</p>
<p>we never thought possible.</p>
<p>The ML Super Resolution feature finds individual details:</p>
<p>edges, colors, gradients, textures,</p>
<p>and it combines it back in an image.</p>
<p>Now, we can build intelligent features into the app.</p>
<p>The possibilities are just endless with this.</p>
<p>[record scratches]</p>
<p>With the A14 chip,</p>
<p>the new Air is going to bring incredible performance</p>
<p>to customers looking to step up to a more powerful iPad.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>Another great feature we&rsquo;re bringing to iPad Air is USB-C.</p>
<p>USB-C increases data transfer speeds up to 5 gigabits per second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tenfold jump in performance over the previous Air.</p>
<p>It provides a fast connection to a host of external devices,</p>
<p>like cameras, drives and external monitors up to 4K.</p>
<p>The new Air also includes great cameras front and back.</p>
<p>The front 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera supports Smart HDR,</p>
<p>improved 1080p video capture and better low-light performance</p>
<p>for really high-quality video calls.</p>
<p>And on the back is the same 12-megapixel camera used in the iPad Pro,</p>
<p>with focus pixels and a larger aperture to capture incredibly sharp photos</p>
<p>and stunning 4K video,</p>
<p>enhanced with improved video stabilization,</p>
<p>so the photos and videos our customers take with the new Air</p>
<p>are gonna look better than ever.</p>
<p>And to elevate the audio experience, we&rsquo;ve redesigned the speaker system,</p>
<p>providing stereo audio in landscape mode.</p>
<p>Great for kicking back and enjoying your favorite movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>The new Air also works with our amazing accessories,</p>
<p>including Apple Pencil,</p>
<p>which attaches magnetically to the side for pairing, charging and storage,</p>
<p>and the beautiful Magic Keyboard,</p>
<p>with floating design and built-in trackpad.</p>
<p>So this is the new iPad Air,</p>
<p>featuring a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display,</p>
<p>next-generation Touch ID,</p>
<p>a huge boost in performance with A14 Bionic,</p>
<p>USB-C, advanced cameras,</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 and LTE that&rsquo;s 60% faster.</p>
<p>This is by far the most powerful iPad Air ever.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check it out.</p>
<p>[electronic music playing]</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the new iPad Air,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait to get it into our customers&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll start at $599.</p>
<p>It will be available beginning next month.</p>
<p>And finally, we&rsquo;re very proud that</p>
<p>the new Air and eighth-generation iPad have been carefully designed</p>
<p>to have minimal impact on the environment</p>
<p>and support our overall net zero carbon goal.</p>
<p>Both iPads use 100% recycled aluminum enclosures,</p>
<p>and all of the wood fiber in the packaging of both iPad models is recycled</p>
<p>or comes from responsibly managed forests.</p>
<p>Both iPads use 100%-recycled tin solder in their main logic boards</p>
<p>and are free of harmful substances.</p>
<p>So while our work here is never finished,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re proud of the progress we&rsquo;ve made with these new products.</p>
<p>So today, we have our most advanced iPad lineup ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a huge year for iPad:</p>
<p>an incredible new iPad Air delivering more pro features to even more customers,</p>
<p>an iPad 8th generation with massive jump in performance,</p>
<p>together with the latest iPad Pro</p>
<p>and the mighty iPad mini,</p>
<p>combined with the advanced features in iPadOS 14</p>
<p>make these by far the most exciting iPads we&rsquo;ve ever shipped.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>What a great day of announcements.</p>
<p>We will also be releasing major OS updates tomorrow,</p>
<p>beginning with iOS 14:</p>
<p>a huge release that transforms the core experience of iPhone</p>
<p>with redesigned widgets right on the Home screen,</p>
<p>a new way to organize your apps with the App Library</p>
<p>and a new and even faster way to experience apps the moment you need them</p>
<p>with App Clips.</p>
<p>iPadOS 14, which lets you do even more with Apple Pencil,</p>
<p>provides huge improvements to iPad apps</p>
<p>and takes the iPad experience even further.</p>
<p>watchOS 7 provides a whole new way to discover and share watch faces,</p>
<p>a new Sleep app, automatic handwashing detection</p>
<p>and provides additional workouts and fitness metrics.</p>
<p>And tvOS 14, which makes your big-screen experience even better</p>
<p>with improved Picture in Picture,</p>
<p>audio sharing with AirPods, Apple Music lyrics,</p>
<p>secure camera feeds from HomeKit and multiuser gaming support.</p>
<p>All of these new releases will be available tomorrow.</p>
<p>And all of the products we announced today will ship with these OS updates.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining us.</p>
<p>At Apple, our mission is to design products and services</p>
<p>that empower and inspire you.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re so excited to see what you&rsquo;ll do</p>
