in but I want to get started</p><p>so tonight I want to cover your eating</p><p>plan I want to cover your diet and what</p><p>you should be eating a lot of you okay</p><p>so some of you can see me and let me</p><p>know if you can see me I can see myself</p><p>okay good you can&rsquo;t see me okay good so</p><p>tonight we&rsquo;re going to talk about your</p><p>diet</p><p>a lot of you have entered in your what</p><p>you eat on a daily basis and we need to</p><p>talk because I see some things we need</p><p>to change but I went through as many as</p><p>I could squeeze in for the next half</p><p>hour so we&rsquo;re just going to go through</p><p>right through it and kind of analyze it</p><p>and I recommend take some notes and I</p><p>would take some of the things that I</p><p>show you tonight and help your friends</p><p>and neighbors and family so that way you</p><p>can analyze their diets as well so let&rsquo;s</p><p>let&rsquo;s just open my screen sharing here</p><p>and go right to let&rsquo;s see if I can find</p><p>it here I think it&rsquo;s where is this thing</p><p>here all right where are you let&rsquo;s see</p><p>close this down sorry about to delay</p><p>there we go perfect no it&rsquo;s right here</p><p>okay good</p><p>so died analysis the way I look at</p><p>someone&rsquo;s food log is I pretty much draw</p><p>a piece of paper and I look at all the</p><p>things that create health and all the</p><p>things that will destroy health and I</p><p>just go right down the list and I look</p><p>at it from the viewpoint of creating</p><p>health versus destroying health there</p><p>are some foods that are neutral foods</p><p>for example oatmeal really</p><p>have any nutrition in it but it&rsquo;s not</p><p>bad for you so I mean it&rsquo;s like eating</p><p>cardboard it&rsquo;s not going to kill you but</p><p>it is really not a nutrition in oatmeal</p><p>unfortunately unless you have steel cut</p><p>and there&rsquo;s some more nutrition but a</p><p>lot of people have the instant oatmeal</p><p>thinking that they&rsquo;re getting some</p><p>nutrition they&rsquo;re really not okay so</p><p>there are also foods that you omit in</p><p>your diet that will destroy your health</p><p>as well we&rsquo;ll cover that as we go</p><p>through I&rsquo;m going to be talking about</p><p>from your eating plan based on fat</p><p>burning are you burning fat how to burn</p><p>fat what are you missing from your diet</p><p>what&rsquo;s going to stop you from burning</p><p>fat we&rsquo;re going to look at different</p><p>hormonal aspects and then also your body</p><p>type of course I did not ask those</p><p>questions as far as to determine your</p><p>body type but I&rsquo;ll go it through some</p><p>things with your body type so you can</p><p>kind of understand what you should be</p><p>eating based on your body type</p><p>reducing craving some of you crave</p><p>certain things I&rsquo;m going to show you</p><p>what to do to get rid of cravings</p><p>because it&rsquo;s impossible to do a program</p><p>while your crave and then I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>talk about how to get all the nutrition</p><p>that you really need from your diet okay</p><p>so with that let&rsquo;s go right into the</p><p>body types now I want to flip back here</p><p>from one second</p><p>let me see here okay I just saw a button</p><p>I to click so you could actually see can</p><p>you see my powerpoint presentation can</p><p>you see the body types on this hopefully</p><p>because I want to make sure that I&rsquo;m not</p><p>doing like half the seminars and I find</p><p>out that you can&rsquo;t even see it I think</p><p>you can see it says you are screen</p><p>sharing presenting everyone so it should</p><p>be fine</p><p>so let&rsquo;s if you look at the first body</p><p>type on the left that is the adrenal</p><p>body type and those types generally</p><p>speaking need more protein than other</p><p>types not excessive amounts but they</p><p>need a little more protein because their</p><p>body is breaking down</p><p>more protein because the hormones are</p><p>are called catabolic that means hormones</p><p>that have the ability to break things</p><p>down faster than they can build back up</p><p>so those people need to have a little</p><p>more protein with each meal okay they</p><p>also are losing potassium through the</p><p>urine and they need to consume a lot of</p><p>potassium from their foods how do we get</p><p>potassium from vegetables so they need</p><p>to consume the greens but they tend to</p><p>have a bit more bloating with certain</p><p>vegetables so they might not be able to</p><p>do broccoli so we don&rsquo;t want them to</p><p>bloat while they eat so any more protein</p><p>I mean they don&rsquo;t want to do a complete</p><p>keep like a protein diet like an Atkins</p><p>diet because they&rsquo;re not going to get</p><p>any vitamins or minerals from the</p><p>vegetables so we need to beef up the</p><p>greens okay they also believe it or not</p><p>you know everyone&rsquo;s pushing this</p><p>alkaline diet you know alkalis or die</p><p>alkaline water well with the adrenal</p><p>their blood is excessively alkaline so</p><p>we need to Sidda PHY them they do really</p><p>well with things like apple cider</p><p>vinegar with water and a little lemon</p><p>with water kombucha tea they do very</p><p>well with that and then because that&rsquo;s</p><p>an adrenal type and they go through a</p><p>lot of stress they definitely need the D</p><p>vitamins but make sure that if you&rsquo;re</p><p>that type don&rsquo;t ever consume synthetic</p><p>unless you&rsquo;re doing some type of detox</p><p>but not long-term you want to get a</p><p>natural B complex I&rsquo;m going to recommend</p><p>nutritional yeast and that will take</p><p>away a lot of stress mental stress</p><p>physical stress and the more you use</p><p>your your brain and your mind and you&rsquo;re</p><p>pushing yourself for the day the more B</p><p>vitamins that you deplete is</p><p>specifically b1 and one of the</p><p>interesting things that will indicate B</p><p>one is if you have nightmares if you</p><p>have excessive vivid dreams then you</p><p>need more b1 all right</p><p>as we go through this I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>answer questions someone says my your</p><p>slide show is frozen that&rsquo;s because it</p><p>should be frozen I didn&rsquo;t move it it is</p><p>just on one slide right now</p><p>is salt substitute a source potassium no</p><p>but they do have different types of</p><p>potassium salts that you can consume</p><p>I recommend get your potassium from</p><p>vegetables but you&rsquo;re going to need five</p><p>to seven to even nine to ten cups of</p><p>salad a day it&rsquo;s not hard to do that</p><p>especially if you have you cut it up and</p><p>have it you know not like make it easy</p><p>to digest you don&rsquo;t have to always have</p><p>lettuce you can use cabbage as your</p><p>salad as well or spinach it&rsquo;s totally</p><p>fun</p><p>alright so so to summarize this type</p><p>right here first type needs more protein</p><p>more potassium more of an acidic drink B</p><p>vitamins and they also need some fat why</p><p>because their blood sugars are usually</p><p>off and they need some type of um don&rsquo;t</p><p>go low-fat with that type so I&rsquo;m not</p><p>opposed to having more fat even meaty</p><p>fat in your diet because they they&rsquo;ll do</p><p>well on that it&rsquo;s not going to turn into</p><p>fat so as we go through this I do want</p><p>to let you know that the way that you</p><p>were probably taught that you have to</p><p>reduce your sodium your fat grams drink</p><p>more water or cut your calories that is</p><p>soon to be outdated information it&rsquo;s</p><p>just that&rsquo;s not workable all right so</p><p>let me go to the next body type and the</p><p>next one is the ovary type you can see</p><p>the hips that is an excessive estrogen</p><p>body type so let me make sure that you</p><p>can see that hopefully you can see that</p><p>um let me just make sure where am I here</p><p>now it disappeared let me just try to</p><p>find it because I want you to see this</p><p>next body type should be right there let</p><p>me see if it&rsquo;s coming up all right</p><p>entire screen try it again oh now where</p><p>is it entire screen no hmm okay so I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to continue to try to figure out</p><p>where this slide went let me just click</p><p>off some of these other slides real fast</p><p>so I can do this maybe it&rsquo;ll work right</p><p>now let&rsquo;s see if it work no okay so this</p><p>next body type is the the person that</p><p>has weight in the hip area and those</p><p>types they need to be careful about</p><p>excessive estrogen so they want to make</p><p>sure that they never consume food with</p><p>with just the hormones they want organic</p><p>foods they want meats that are grass-fed</p><p>hormone free especially dairy yogurt</p><p>kefir butter cheese all those things</p><p>must not contain hormones because that&rsquo;s</p><p>what messed them up they also have to</p><p>avoid soy products and that would be</p><p>especially in the soy protein isolates</p><p>and all the diet shakes read the labels</p><p>make sure that you do not consume soy a</p><p>lot of the bars that they have right now</p><p>are totally loaded with soy and that</p><p>acts as estrogen estrogen but the foods</p><p>that they should eat are anti estrogenic</p><p>foods and that would be the cruciferous</p><p>that would be cabbage kale Brussels</p><p>sprouts if they had a Cal shake every</p><p>day the couple that would be very</p><p>beneficial to help balance the estrogen</p><p>they can consume a bit more protein and</p><p>they can also have a similar eating plan</p><p>than the adrenal because the adrenal</p><p>over are very similar they produce very</p><p>similar hormones okay third shape is the</p><p>see if I can pull it up now let&rsquo;s see if</p><p>it came up I don&rsquo;t know why that doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>show up that&rsquo;s weird</p><p>um the ovary type the ovary type let me</p><p>see here now they dream the I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>the thyroid type that is the person</p><p>that&rsquo;s gaining weight here we go alright</p><p>good we got it perfect okay so the third</p><p>type is the person that has gained</p><p>weight all over not any one location</p><p>that&rsquo;s a thyroid type there&rsquo;s two</p><p>primary causes for thyroid one is that</p><p>they&rsquo;re not converting the thyroid</p><p>hormone through the liver in which case</p><p>you need to have them eat foods to</p><p>support the liver and that would be not</p><p>consuming too much protein maybe having</p><p>a lot of vegetables to clean out the</p><p>liver and I&rsquo;m recommending that you have</p><p>um when I talk about a more protein I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking about really six to seven ounces</p><p>I&rsquo;m not talking about 8 to 9 to 10</p><p>ounces I&rsquo;m just talking about what you</p><p>would consider average okay but if we</p><p>want to clean the liver out because if</p><p>we look at the last body type that&rsquo;s the</p><p>liver type you can see the pot belly</p><p>that&rsquo;s a liver type but again the liver</p><p>malfunction can cause a thyroid you&rsquo;d</p><p>want to consume foods for the liver so</p><p>that would be lower amounts of protein</p><p>maybe 2 to 3 ounces of protein with each</p><p>meal that&rsquo;s all so this type if it&rsquo;s if</p><p>it&rsquo;s like the question is how do you</p><p>know if your thyroid problem is coming</p><p>from the gallbladder liver or high</p><p>estrogen well first of all ask yourself</p><p>do you get bloating do you have gall</p><p>bladder symptoms do you have liver</p><p>problems</p><p>have you had your gallbladder removed do</p><p>you get burping belching all that you</p><p>know those things you should find out</p><p>and then if you do then you can go ahead</p><p>and start eating correctly for that body</p><p>type but when I talk about protein I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking about per meal not per day so if</p><p>it&rsquo;s over here on the adrenal type baby</p><p>should be consuming about you know 6 to</p><p>7 ounces per meal and these liver types</p><p>should have at two to three ounces per</p><p>meal ok all right now</p><p>trying to give you the basics there is</p><p>definitely complexities because let&rsquo;s</p><p>say you&rsquo;re a little bit of this a little</p><p>bit of this a little bit of this what do</p><p>you do don&rsquo;t worry about that right now</p><p>I will go through a lot of different</p><p>cases and we&rsquo;ll just show you what you</p><p>should be doing generally speaking</p><p>because let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re confused and</p><p>you don&rsquo;t know if your thyroid problem</p><p>is coming from the gallbladder or high</p><p>estrogen and let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s obvious and</p><p>you have a you have good digestion but</p><p>you have heavy periods that we know it&rsquo;s</p><p>estrogen so now I would have you eat</p><p>according to the ovary type because that</p><p>is the root cause of the thyroid problem</p><p>it&rsquo;s very rare to have a primary thyroid</p><p>issue but what&rsquo;s really even interesting</p><p>if you have an adrenal case and you get</p><p>an autoimmune situation that can also</p><p>cause a thyroid issue so you really have</p><p>to kind of take the data look at each</p><p>part and see what makes sense the other</p><p>way to do it is to start with one eating</p><p>plan see how you feel see how you do and</p><p>then go to the next one and see which</p><p>one does better because sometimes you</p><p>don&rsquo;t really know unless you try some</p><p>people do very well on high protein some</p><p>people do not but the thyroid cases</p><p>generally need they very well with</p><p>cruciferous vegetables but make sure you</p><p>have the iodine with seek help that</p><p>works really good and they need a small</p><p>amount of protein because metabolism is</p><p>so slow they can&rsquo;t digest large amounts</p><p>of protein the other thing that they</p><p>need would be trace minerals trace</p><p>minerals help the conversion of proteins</p><p>into body tissue like hair nails skin if</p><p>you have brittle nails loss of hair you</p><p>know skin that&rsquo;s falling off your body</p><p>then we know that you might need some</p><p>trace minerals to activate the protein</p><p>collagen versus just consuming more</p><p>protein that which doesn&rsquo;t work so a lot</p><p>of people that consume trace minerals</p><p>all of a sudden their hair gets stops</p><p>falling out they do very well in fact</p><p>next Tuesday I&rsquo;m going to release a</p><p>video on that</p><p>another question is how much iodine</p><p>should you take I always recommend that</p><p>you consume it in a food based thing</p><p>like seek help you know have like two or</p><p>three seek help tablets a day to get</p><p>your iodine and that should be enough</p><p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily need so much like</p><p>four milligrams of iodine whatever like</p><p>because iodine works in a complex with</p><p>all the minerals and when you consume</p><p>straight iodine not a plant-based iodine</p><p>it&rsquo;s very difficult for your body to</p><p>utilize that it&rsquo;s much better to have a</p><p>food base because it breaks down easier</p><p>last case is the liver type you can see</p><p>the potbelly here this person should not</p><p>consume large quantities of protein they</p><p>need to do it they would do very well as</p><p>a vegetarian because but a real</p><p>vegetarian where they&rsquo;re actually eating</p><p>vegetables because with that they can</p><p>clean out the liver support the liver</p><p>and do very well with the gallbladder</p><p>and lose a lot of weight because a lot</p><p>of that weight in the stomach is fluid</p><p>okay all right so that is the body types</p><p>now we&rsquo;re going to get into a couple</p><p>other things here I&rsquo;m going to go right</p><p>to the next slide let&rsquo;s see if you can</p><p>see that oh yeah you can okay good well</p><p>guess what</p><p>they just found just found out that eggs</p><p>are not as bad as they thought they were</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about the government the new</p><p>guidelines governmental guidelines from</p><p>the nutritionist finally after 40 years</p><p>said that eggs are okay to consume but</p><p>they still say that butter is still bad</p><p>first of all please please don&rsquo;t get</p><p>your health information from the</p><p>government if you&rsquo;re not going to get</p><p>the correct information it&rsquo;s 40 years -</p><p>like eggs like I&rsquo;ve been saying for 25</p><p>years is that the most perfect food that</p><p>you can possibly eat</p><p>um in fact let me just go to the next</p><p>slide to show you what&rsquo;s in an egg here</p><p>we go</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can see it but these</p><p>are Canadian eggs but if you have eggs</p><p>from chickens that are fed organically</p><p>free-range they&rsquo;re the best they provide</p><p>a lot of vitamins a lot of minerals and</p><p>the best part is the yolk the yolk is</p><p>where all the real good nutrition is so</p><p>if you just eat egg whites you&rsquo;re just</p><p>getting a real small portion but in the</p><p>yolk they have lecithin to counter</p><p>cholesterol so don&rsquo;t worry about that I</p><p>do four eggs every single day I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>doing it forever if you&rsquo;re a female and</p><p>you don&rsquo;t weigh that much I weigh 210</p><p>pounds maybe you want to do two eggs</p><p>okay maybe you don&rsquo;t like eggs I&rsquo;m just</p><p>saying if you like eggs it&rsquo;s a very good</p><p>way to get your nutrition so don&rsquo;t worry</p><p>about eggs and also butter butter is</p><p>actually good it&rsquo;s not a bad thing again</p><p>probably another 40 years they&rsquo;ll tell</p><p>you it&rsquo;s okay to eat butter there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot of nutrition in butter but I also</p><p>always recommend the Kerrygold butter</p><p>you can get it from any health food</p><p>store okay so a lot of you filled out</p><p>your food logs for me too - yeah eggs</p><p>are good for all body types by the way</p><p>Kim so I&rsquo;m going to go through some of</p><p>the some people who fill out the food</p><p>lock so I can analyze their diet so</p><p>let&rsquo;s first look at April April for</p><p>breakfast she had toast toast and meat</p><p>or yogurt with fruit granola or a</p><p>smoothie or shake for a snack she</p><p>usually does not snack that&rsquo;s fine</p><p>grilled chicken wrap with veggies salad</p><p>chicken salad no bread with lettuce and</p><p>tomato I like that I like that so you</p><p>push she probably wraps it with the</p><p>lettuce that&rsquo;s a very good idea dinner</p><p>maybe nothing depending on how she feels</p><p>or vegetable soup beans rice or</p><p>vegetables with grilled chicken okay so</p><p>the good things are she&rsquo;s having protein</p><p>with her breakfast some of it sometimes</p><p>that&rsquo;s good I love her lunch that&rsquo;s</p><p>really good</p><p>I also if she has a good healthy</p><p>vegetable soup if she makes it herself</p><p>that&rsquo;s really good</p><p>again she has vegetables grilled chicken</p><p>I&rsquo;m okay with that</p><p>but here&rsquo;s the thing that I want to talk</p><p>about you want the breakfast to have no</p><p>carbs in it at all</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about refined carbs and</p><p>hidden sugars like toast why because</p><p>that is going to nullify any type of</p><p>fat-burning effect on your body now Beth</p><p>just asked the question I find them very</p><p>cyclically eating spring summer fall I</p><p>eat a lot of vegetables winter not so</p><p>much that&rsquo;s totally fine Beth but here&rsquo;s</p><p>the thing make sure you get your</p><p>vitamins and minerals from something</p><p>believe it or not a lot of the</p><p>vegetables that people eat provide most</p><p>of the vitamins and minerals the</p><p>question is where are you getting them</p><p>do you have some type of substitute that</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to be able to get your</p><p>vitamins from and minerals so make sure</p><p>that you have that under control but</p><p>toast is going to be a problem it&rsquo;s also</p><p>going to slow down fat burning and just</p><p>a little bit of toast could knock you on</p><p>a fat burning for at least eight hours</p><p>unfortunately especially if your</p><p>metabolism is low now there are levels</p><p>of grains that are better than others</p><p>Ezekiel bread is better than white bread</p><p>but again if you&rsquo;re trying to burn fat</p><p>you might know what a consuming toast</p><p>now the yogurt is something else I want</p><p>to talk about yogurt make sure that you</p><p>do not consume the plain yogurt why I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry</p><p>the vanilla yogurt or the flavored</p><p>yogurt because there&rsquo;s a lot of sugar in</p><p>that yogurt make sure it&rsquo;s plain and</p><p>make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t contain any</p><p>sugar added sugar okay another person</p><p>says how can I proceed my husband that</p><p>eating a little carb will halt fat</p><p>burning well have them read my book</p><p>watch the videos and try and experiment</p><p>try to eat little carbon C if you lose</p><p>weight</p><p>chances are you won&rsquo;t if you cut the</p><p>carb out then you can prove it to</p><p>yourself that it works so I always like</p><p>to instead of telling someone that this</p><p>is true I recommend go ahead demonstrate</p><p>it on yourself you put yourself in a</p><p>place where you can just do what I&rsquo;m</p><p>recommending and see if it works for you</p><p>then then I don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t need to</p><p>believe me you can just try it I&rsquo;m just</p><p>what I want to do is give you the</p><p>mistakes of a lot of people over many</p><p>years so you don&rsquo;t have to make the same</p><p>mistake over and over and over okay so</p><p>now by the way this video is being</p><p>recorded so if you&rsquo;re losing connection</p><p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s basically your computer&rsquo;s</p><p>not working correctly but this will be</p><p>recorded perfectly and it&rsquo;ll be up right</p><p>when I get done now the other thing</p><p>that&rsquo;s really high in sugar is the</p><p>granola granola is massively high in</p><p>sugar it&rsquo;s not a good health food</p><p>product at all</p><p>the other thing is fruit for breakfast I</p><p>don&rsquo;t recommend a lot of fruit for</p><p>breakfast maybe a little berries but not</p><p>a lot why because fruit is turns in the</p><p>sugar a lot faster than vegetables so we</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to create a blood sugar</p><p>problem early under the day if you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have some fruit it&rsquo;s better to</p><p>have it in the later part of the day</p><p>because this is going to this fruit is</p><p>going to affect your sugars and at the</p><p>end of the day you&rsquo;re gonna have a</p><p>tendency to crave more sweet and be a</p><p>little bit more tired so here&rsquo;s a great</p><p>thing to test out try this experiment</p><p>consume a fruit breakfast granola</p><p>breakfast one day and the next day have</p><p>a completely protein breakfast and see</p><p>how well you do through the day and</p><p>you&rsquo;ll be able to prove it to yourself</p><p>at the end of the day you have a lot</p><p>more energy if you have protein and you</p><p>won&rsquo;t have a blood sugar issue and</p><p>mentally you won&rsquo;t have brain fog</p><p>so the next thing right here she had</p><p>grilled chicken okay soup yeah rice and</p><p>beans those turn into sugar pretty fast</p><p>so you might</p><p>avoid those April and the other thing is</p><p>that I want to make sure that the</p><p>quantity of vegetables are high enough</p><p>to provide the nutrition so I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>that from what April typed in but I</p><p>should have asked her how many cups of</p><p>vegetables is she consuming here&rsquo;s some</p><p>hidden sugars we got the flavored yogurt</p><p>the granola and of course the fiber one</p><p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of sugar of these</p><p>things um so we labels look at the sugar</p><p>grams don&rsquo;t worry about the fat grams or</p><p>sodium reps check this out</p><p>french vanilla look at low fat this is</p><p>what really ticks me off if you go to</p><p>the store and you probably try to find</p><p>some whole milk you know yogurt I want</p><p>the fat in there that&rsquo;s the good part</p><p>look at this 28 grams of sugar what</p><p>they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re putting</p><p>attention on the fat but not the sugar</p><p>the sugar is what&rsquo;s killing them not the</p><p>fat so if you&rsquo;re going to have</p><p>Stonyfield make sure it is plain and</p><p>whole fat okay so that&rsquo;s what I want you</p><p>to do on that let&rsquo;s look at Jim Jim has</p><p>bacon eggs cheese on a roll so the first</p><p>thing I&rsquo;m going to say is Jim I have no</p><p>problem with you doing bacon just buy</p><p>the bacon from something like Trader</p><p>Joe&rsquo;s where they have no nitrates</p><p>hormone-free totally fine it&rsquo;s not a</p><p>problem Jim it&rsquo;s not going to hurt you</p><p>it&rsquo;s not a bad product some people freak</p><p>out about you know pigs but pork but</p><p>what happens is that chicken is much</p><p>dirtier than pork just so you know so</p><p>I&rsquo;m not against bacon especially if it&rsquo;s</p><p>not nitrate free and it&rsquo;s organic and</p><p>okay eggs cheese good but this roll has</p><p>to go we don&rsquo;t want to do the gruel we</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to do the crackers we don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to do the bread with the cheese and</p><p>ham you&rsquo;d be much better if you just</p><p>took some ham and melted some cheese</p><p>over and consume that with a little bit</p><p>of salad now the Apple Jim it&rsquo;s not a</p><p>problem especially in male bodies the</p><p>only time I recommend knock and</p><p>sending apples is if you&rsquo;re really</p><p>trying to lose weight and you tried</p><p>everything an apple could be enough</p><p>sugar to slow you down and so in some</p><p>people to accelerate weight loss</p><p>I&rsquo;ll have them cut out all apples and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll switch them to celery and peanut</p><p>butter okay so for dinner he has meat</p><p>burger sloppy joes tacos and then he has</p><p>a cheese cake okay Jim the cheesecake is</p><p>going to pretty much you know sit in</p><p>your stomach all night the sugar and</p><p>you&rsquo;re just going to cause you to gain</p><p>weight unfortunately sloppy joes make</p><p>sure that you read the label and it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have all these high fructose</p><p>corn syrup and msg and sugar so you want</p><p>to avoid that</p><p>Carol breakfast two packs of instant</p><p>oatmeal oatmeal it&rsquo;s not going to kill</p><p>you but it&rsquo;s not going to help you it&rsquo;s</p><p>like eating cardboard there&rsquo;s nothing</p><p>really in it the other thing you want to</p><p>realize is that that carb breakfast at</p><p>the end of the day you&rsquo;re going to feel</p><p>brain fog tired craving for sweets and</p><p>week you probably want to take a nap</p><p>right around five six o&rsquo;clock at night</p><p>so you&rsquo;d want to switch this but if she</p><p>just switched the breakfast to a protein</p><p>breakfast and let me just show you what</p><p>I mean by that see if you can see this</p><p>here so if you look right here we have a</p><p>kale shake for breakfast and then we</p><p>have eggs</p><p>one day this person has a little piece</p><p>of meat steak omelets eggs totally good</p><p>good breakfast looking for lunch some</p><p>vegetable with some protein fish perfect</p><p>nuts cheese not a problem</p><p>another vegetable protein and then look</p><p>at Apple hummus cheese nuts snack</p><p>this would be a like the ideal scene if</p><p>you can do that let me just check the</p><p>questions right here yeah so someone</p><p>said that they mix blueberries bananas</p><p>kale spinach cinnamon eat Wow it&rsquo;s like</p><p>ice cream so you&rsquo;re mixing everything I</p><p>think you said smart one I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>what that is Bradley but smart one turn</p><p>beyond to almond milk with blueberries</p><p>bananas kale spinach carrots and well</p><p>that sounds like a interesting good</p><p>thing to do probably like going to shake</p><p>the berries in the kale shake</p><p>I recommend blueberries and other</p><p>berries because that is the lowest</p><p>glycemic index versus bananas but you</p><p>can do some banana I&rsquo;m not against that</p><p>but again I&rsquo;m dealing with people that</p><p>cannot lose weight no matter what and I</p><p>just cut out some of that stuff</p><p>especially in the beginning okay now</p><p>Carol oatmeal granola bar it&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>sugar I would I&rsquo;m curious if your yogurt</p><p>is flavored it might be again a lot of</p><p>sugar to hot dogs</p><p>make sure those hot dogs don&rsquo;t have</p><p>modified food starch so this is the</p><p>ingredients in Oscar Mayer burgers I</p><p>mean hot dogs you can see there&rsquo;s a lot</p><p>of dextrose that&rsquo;s sugar</p><p>hi dries yeast that&rsquo;s msg smoke flavor</p><p>not good sodium dices 8/8 sodium we</p><p>throw bait made from sugar sodium</p><p>nitrate sounds pretty dangerous to me so</p><p>make sure you get high quality hotdogs</p><p>snacks</p><p>marble oranges okay you can do that I</p><p>like the idea of having the whole Orange</p><p>versus orange juice and then let&rsquo;s say</p><p>noodle pea carrot chicken I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>what that is but I like the chickens and</p><p>the carrots and the peas I don&rsquo;t know if</p><p>I like the noodles granola bar again in</p><p>1/2 peanut butter sandwich okay so Carol</p><p>we need to change some things here</p><p>um Joanne 1 and 1/2 cups of coffee with</p><p>four level teaspoons of non-dairy</p><p>creamer and sucralose so there&rsquo;s</p><p>basically let&rsquo;s talk about coffee for a</p><p>second I&rsquo;m not opposed to a small amount</p><p>of coffee but I did have one lady who</p><p>consumed like 10 to 15 cups today that&rsquo;s</p><p>way too much um 1 cup of coffee ok you</p><p>can do that I like the idea of having</p><p>some organic cream because the non-dairy</p><p>creamers have a lot of chemicals in them</p><p>so I would be careful of that I like the</p><p>idea of you taking sucralose that is a</p><p>sugar alcohol so there&rsquo;s two types of</p><p>sugars that are acceptable sugar</p><p>alcohols and stevia the top of the list</p><p>would be xylitol I like that one the</p><p>best because it creates the least amount</p><p>of digestive issues and it&rsquo;s from birch</p><p>bark and it tastes just like sugar</p><p>xylitol with an X okay that could be</p><p>your sweetener so as I&rsquo;m looking at your</p><p>breakfast where&rsquo;s the food Joanne um</p><p>there&rsquo;s no food</p><p>so she skips the breakfast at the</p><p>evening time she might crave the wrong</p><p>thing so she has pack of noodles of</p><p>noodles again no nutrition all carbs</p><p>dinner sometimes noodles again 2 cups of</p><p>spaghetti or two chicken legs die breast</p><p>with potato green beans rarely afford</p><p>beef but if I do it&rsquo;s usually only one</p><p>medium to one Patty I wouldn&rsquo;t have cut</p><p>the Box mac and cheese green beans small</p><p>piece of beef well then why don&rsquo;t you</p><p>buy eggs eggs are not that expensive you</p><p>know you can get a whole dozen for $3 so</p><p>that&rsquo;s something you might want to try</p><p>doing and also vegetables are not that</p><p>expensive so if you can&rsquo;t afford organic</p><p>then just have regular vegetables that</p><p>are not organic because some vegetables</p><p>are better than no vegetables okay Karen</p><p>so let&rsquo;s talk about Karen um Karen</p><p>oatmeal with blueberries again the</p><p>oatmeal is something we want to avoid</p><p>walnuts are goods good milk I&rsquo;m not</p><p>opposed to that make sure it&rsquo;s one about</p><p>free snacks orange juice with seltzer</p><p>water there&rsquo;s a lot of sugar in orange</p><p>juice unfortunately in fact we just show</p><p>you real quick minute mate look at how</p><p>much sugars and minivan horseshoes</p><p>versus regular orange juice so I rather</p><p>orange juice really has no nutritional</p><p>value because it&rsquo;s pasteurized all the</p><p>vitamin C is destroyed that&rsquo;s why they</p><p>add vitamin C back into it but it&rsquo;s</p><p>always synthetic there is no benefit</p><p>towards juice other than causing a</p><p>destruction in your health because it&rsquo;s</p><p>so high in sugar okay um it&rsquo;s only good</p><p>if you add vodka and you make now just</p><p>kidding don&rsquo;t do that that&rsquo;s something</p><p>you would do at college okay one slice</p><p>of whole grain bread with peanut butter</p><p>all right so why don&rsquo;t you put the</p><p>peanut butter on the celery two slices</p><p>of turkey rolled up with Swiss cheese</p><p>okay I like that that is great idea</p><p>Karen this is good just mix your cheese</p><p>with your protein snack one hard-boiled</p><p>eggs few whole a few whole grain</p><p>crackers or pretzels all right we need</p><p>to cut that out that&rsquo;s not a good snack</p><p>sauteed onions garlic</p><p>let&rsquo;s see colored drained cabbage oh</p><p>that&rsquo;s good oh you stuck in the</p><p>cornbread barbecue chicken you were</p><p>almost there</p><p>Karen but you you you add to the</p><p>cornbread so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>that would cut out but you know the</p><p>barbecue sauce</p><p>there are barbecue sauces that you can</p><p>buy with with stevia so just do a search</p><p>on stevia Sweden barbecue sauce and</p><p>you&rsquo;ll find some really good ones okay</p><p>so I see you had some Italian ice cream</p><p>just to put the icing on the cake so</p><p>that probably will really just kind of</p><p>destroy everything you did for that day</p><p>Karen but that&rsquo;s because your breakfast</p><p>was not</p><p>strong enough with protein that&rsquo;s the</p><p>only reason to be proudly crave okay</p><p>Raquel or Rachel a breakfast protein</p><p>powder ah let&rsquo;s see she has hemp rice or</p><p>peat I like that that&rsquo;s fine</p><p>those are three good protein powders</p><p>let&rsquo;s see</p><p>warning vitamins okay so everything is</p><p>good but where&rsquo;s um okay so you&rsquo;re just</p><p>doing protein I think that could be</p><p>workable um yeah that could be workable</p><p>if you have enough of the protein but if</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to do just protein like</p><p>that you&rsquo;re probably gonna need at least</p><p>25 to 30 grams of protein okay next one</p><p>is the snack is the whole oats oat milk</p><p>chia seeds plain yogurt okay</p><p>frozen berries okay I like everything</p><p>except the oats okay let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s nix</p><p>that veggie tacos sauteed sweet potato</p><p>sweet potatoes don&rsquo;t have them very</p><p>often that you can have them</p><p>occasionally and full of kale orange</p><p>bell pepper tortilla top with one slice</p><p>what&rsquo;s really hot sauce hard-boiled eggs</p><p>okay so the cord if we could just mix</p><p>the corn you&rsquo;d be fine on that our</p><p>almonds is a great snack quinoa quinoa</p><p>is okay it&rsquo;s better than rice in small</p><p>quantities all right so now we have</p><p>sauteed vegetables totally fun okay so</p><p>far so good so she&rsquo;s having a lot of</p><p>veggies so she&rsquo;s getting her nutrition</p><p>she&rsquo;s just throwing a few too many</p><p>things in there that we need to correct</p><p>Kimberly so Kimberly has the two eggs on</p><p>the toast so that&rsquo;s again you can see a</p><p>pattern here with everyone right they</p><p>like that toast um blueberry smoothie</p><p>with almond okay that&rsquo;s cool that&rsquo;s good</p><p>avocado I have a half an avocado with</p><p>breakfast every</p><p>morning with my eggs nuts are good</p><p>two eggs buttered gluten-free toast</p><p>again gluten-free but it still is a car</p><p>now she has a blueberry smoothie with</p><p>almond milk at night that&rsquo;s interesting</p><p>not a bad idea okay</p><p>Activia low-fat yogurt but I bet you</p><p>it&rsquo;s flavored because it&rsquo;s hard to find</p><p>plain bacteria there&rsquo;s a lot of sugar on</p><p>that by the way bran cereal there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot of sugar in that Apple okay</p><p>salad with fresh fat-free dressing no</p><p>croutons okay sandwich so just you know</p><p>the problem is going to be the bread on</p><p>that but I like the idea you&rsquo;re having a</p><p>salad that&rsquo;s really good and also lean</p><p>meat let&rsquo;s see fiber one chocolate bar</p><p>yeah I looked that up fiber one has a</p><p>lot of syrup corn syrup rice syrup it&rsquo;s</p><p>ten grams of sugar per bar yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>just a little too much sugar it&rsquo;s not a</p><p>little too much is actually too much so</p><p>that is a situation so I would avoid</p><p>that as your snack dinner um chicken</p><p>fish small month of red meat with</p><p>veggies usually a starch also potatoes</p><p>yeah so we got too much starch too many</p><p>refined carbs and the Beth is going to</p><p>have a hard time losing weight on that</p><p>okay Tony</p><p>let me just make sure there&rsquo;s any little</p><p>questions here how do I feel about hemp</p><p>protein yeah hemp protein is totally</p><p>fine it&rsquo;s not bad on some people it&rsquo;s</p><p>hard to digest so you might want to see</p><p>if he goes down well under your system</p><p>let&rsquo;s see here I want to see something</p><p>here</p><p>I want to scan to see if there&rsquo;s any</p><p>more questions</p><p>okay Tony let&rsquo;s see here 12 ounces of</p><p>kale smoothie with almond milk spinach</p><p>apple ginger 2 eggs large glass 11 what</p><p>I like that see this is good she has the</p><p>Apple so Tony is the opposite of vinegar</p><p>with lemon water that&rsquo;s really good to</p><p>help satisfy the blood Sugar&rsquo;s as well</p><p>she has the vegetables this would be a</p><p>really good breakfast</p><p>okay good a snack apple cheese</p><p>rike RISP for those of you that don&rsquo;t</p><p>know what that is</p><p>i&rsquo;ll show you a picture this is an</p><p>acceptable cracker that you could do</p><p>it&rsquo;s called rye crisp crackers the thin</p><p>ones sometimes they have think caraway</p><p>seeds but it&rsquo;s really thin you can put</p><p>cheese on it and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s totally okay</p><p>all right not a problem with that oh you</p><p>see if I okay we just go through here</p><p>and find my there it&rsquo;s gone again I try</p><p>to find that thing see if I can do that</p><p>there we go okay so let me just go back</p><p>here for a second</p><p>Tony all right so right Kris crackers</p><p>with all the butter herbal tea totally</p><p>fine homemade soup guacamole hummus</p><p>omelet totally fine a bottle of water I</p><p>just want to make sure that you Tony</p><p>you&rsquo;re not drinking water unless you&rsquo;re</p><p>thirsty because people are told that</p><p>they need a drink drink drink if you</p><p>drink too much water um it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>flush out electrolytes so only drink</p><p>what you&rsquo;re thirsty</p><p>oh if you&rsquo;re disagreeing with that then</p><p>watch my video on water and just get all</p><p>the data okay so now we got dinner we</p><p>got fish chicken veggie salad perfect</p><p>this is what I recommend and then to</p><p>snack at the munchies badly in the</p><p>evening now if she&rsquo;s getting the</p><p>munchies in the evening then what</p><p>happens is that we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>and more fat in the breakfast time so</p><p>she may need to add a little bit more</p><p>like avocado or butter or peanut butter</p><p>with celery because she&rsquo;s craving down</p><p>here or a little more protein yeah or a</p><p>couple more eggs but look at she craves</p><p>chocolate bread products like an addict</p><p>so if you create chocolate and bread you</p><p>may want to consume the B vitamins from</p><p>from it&rsquo;s called nutritional yeast and</p><p>that should curb your cravings for bread</p><p>okay chocolate that could be an adrenal</p><p>issue see I try to avoid and eat more</p><p>veggies but I find it hard to yeah I</p><p>would actually go with more fat of your</p><p>foods than veggies like cheese like</p><p>peanut butter with celery let&rsquo;s see okay</p><p>she likes chocolate</p><p>alright let&rsquo;s take a look at something</p><p>here let&rsquo;s take a look at this right</p><p>here</p><p>lilies lilies chocolate is flavored with</p><p>stevia this would be a good chocolate to</p><p>consume because if you really need</p><p>chocolate at least it has zero sugars</p><p>okay so someone Jim asked could your</p><p>kale shake or almond milk be a good</p><p>breakfast yes but it might not be enough</p><p>protein I do have another Cal shade</p><p>coming down the pike I&rsquo;m going to take</p><p>about two months to get it though it&rsquo;s</p><p>going to have a high amount of protein</p><p>because I do some people are trying to</p><p>get more protein so I&rsquo;m going to add</p><p>more protein but you&rsquo;d have to add a</p><p>couple eggs to that says which do you</p><p>prefer egg protein powder or pea protein</p><p>powder personally I would do the egg</p><p>protein powder in the shake absolutely</p><p>nutritional yeast is so powerful in</p><p>flavor can it go in soup can it be</p><p>heated good question</p><p>um yes it can be heated but not overly</p><p>heated but yes you I like to put it in</p><p>you can put it in peanut butter you can</p><p>put it in plain yogurt you can put it in</p><p>soup</p><p>absolutely okay let&rsquo;s see here</p><p>all right Lina breakfast let&rsquo;s see what</p><p>she consumes I guess that&rsquo;s not 80</p><p>ounces of juice that must be 8 ounce</p><p>glass juice vegetables and fruit wait a</p><p>half-hour and a cup of coffee no sugar</p><p>she has she has the pumpernickel bagel</p><p>or toast bread with grass-fed butter so</p><p>the question is what do you put your</p><p>butter on I am going to release very</p><p>soon a recipe for English muffins that</p><p>you can make that tastes just like</p><p>English muffins but they&rsquo;re not made</p><p>from any wheat at all or grains so I</p><p>will settle it out so that way you can</p><p>put your butter on it it&rsquo;s from one of</p><p>my patients who had this recipe I loved</p><p>it it was amazing so I will make it and</p><p>then share that of a video ok all right</p><p>so we got let&rsquo;s see occasion weekend&rsquo;s</p><p>omelet all right sandwich that bread</p><p>needs to go i some day this skip</p><p>breakfast just had my juice of coffee</p><p>yeah well at night you&rsquo;re gonna crave ok</p><p>she also has for lunch vegetables good</p><p>she has that without so let&rsquo;s see</p><p>mayonnaise mayonnaise is totally fine</p><p>don&rsquo;t worry about that um let&rsquo;s see</p><p>oh here we go one teaspoon of agave</p><p>nectar agave nectar is very similar to</p><p>honey it still turns into sugar fat I</p><p>mean almost as close as is honey and so</p><p>it&rsquo;s not a low glycemic sweetener I</p><p>don&rsquo;t recommend it especially if you&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to lose weight ok so his barbecue</p><p>chicken and she had the fries or rice ok</p><p>that is an issue whole grain it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to stop weight loss potatoes so we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to just avoid all the</p><p>starches let&rsquo;s see</p><p>they&rsquo;re meat eaters that&rsquo;s fine but just</p><p>don&rsquo;t add all the starches and</p><p>Barb&rsquo;s okay alright here we go carry</p><p>gold butter is the best butter because</p><p>it&rsquo;s grass-fed butter and carry gold</p><p>also makes the best cheese I love this</p><p>cheese it&rsquo;s really good and it&rsquo;s</p><p>grass-fed so it has vitamin k2 so let&rsquo;s</p><p>say Jacqueline says all this works no</p><p>doubt about it but I always fail to</p><p>maintain the changes to my diet and</p><p>revert back to old ways and gain the way</p><p>back how do I stop this well I just</p><p>created a video on that it should come</p><p>out tomorrow on self-discipline because</p><p>it&rsquo;s something that people slide into</p><p>because the thing with your body stantly</p><p>create a healthy body and it&rsquo;s something</p><p>that takes work just like a relationship</p><p>you have to constantly put it there so</p><p>you might slide into old habits but I</p><p>think what you should do is find these</p><p>little substitute things that you really</p><p>like recipes that are like healthy junk</p><p>food you can download on my website and</p><p>start incorporating healthier ways to</p><p>make the junk food and make sure it&rsquo;s</p><p>healthy and that way you&rsquo;re not</p><p>necessarily depriving yourself ok Diane</p><p>says I wake up very hungry um so so let</p><p>me just see what she&rsquo;s doing here if</p><p>you&rsquo;re waking up hungry then we need to</p><p>make sure that you we add more protein</p><p>or some fat but she wants salty pretzels</p><p>a chocolate and a glass of good wine so</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing if you have low blood</p><p>sugars you really need to work on fixing</p><p>of that I have a lot of videos on how to</p><p>do with blood sugar issues and what you</p><p>should eat so to the point where your</p><p>blood sugars are better about or better</p><p>because I will tell you that if your</p><p>sugars are low if you have low blood</p><p>sugars you will crave because of that</p><p>so as you do this you&rsquo;re going to have</p><p>to start realizing that Ukrainians won&rsquo;t</p><p>go away until your blood Sugar&rsquo;s are</p><p>well established I used to have</p><p>hypoglycemic so bad but I tell you that</p><p>the eating plan that I&rsquo;m showing you</p><p>right here will correct it over time all</p><p>right</p><p>is Kerrygold</p><p>organic as far as I know it is but it&rsquo;s</p><p>grass-fed so most hundred percent</p><p>positive it is because I know they don&rsquo;t</p><p>put pesticides in it um I best as I find</p><p>if I eat in the morning when I&rsquo;m not</p><p>hungry I&rsquo;m starving all day oh you get</p><p>up at 5:00 okay</p><p>well maybe you should just eat at 8:00</p><p>or 9:00 so just yeah because the whole</p><p>circadian rhythm doesn&rsquo;t kick in because</p><p>you&rsquo;re waking up extra early so</p><p>that&rsquo;sthat&rsquo;s fine you can eat at 9:00 or</p><p>10:00 not a problem and that works for</p><p>you totally fun yeah I like that</p><p>okay Cheryl two eggs so here we go with</p><p>the toast again</p><p>sourdough spelt steel-cut oatmeal honey</p><p>it&rsquo;s just going to be too much carbs</p><p>Cheryl okay Greek yogurt blueberries</p><p>avocado I like this I like this snack</p><p>but the apple juice has to go sorry</p><p>um lean protein good Apple or roll nuts</p><p>with cheese okay lean protein everything</p><p>else is good of course</p><p>ice cream needs to go there are types of</p><p>ice cream that are zero carbs you can</p><p>try to find some I think I have that</p><p>and my little booklet on my website you</p><p>can download it here&rsquo;s a little chart</p><p>that will give you some data on fat</p><p>burning on one of my links on my website</p><p>fat burning foods after ebooks you can</p><p>download this little sheet some of you</p><p>have it already but it&rsquo;s a good little</p><p>summary of what we talked about with</p><p>that burning of so it&rsquo;s dr. Berg comm</p><p>ebooks for slash fat burning foods for</p><ul><li>burning - foods okay you could</li></ul><p>download that Albert breakfast he gets</p><p>up too late around ten eleven maybe bowl</p><p>of cereal you sound like me when I was</p><p>18 Albert snack whatever food is</p><p>available okay lunch whatever&rsquo;s</p><p>available chili luxe beans in a can</p><p>maybe frozen pizza of our camp food so</p><p>Albert either you&rsquo;re new to my website</p><p>and you have not watched any of the</p><p>videos that I had over the last 15 years</p><p>or you know or maybe that&rsquo;s the reason</p><p>or you&rsquo;re not complying with what I&rsquo;m</p><p>recommending but Albert I recommend get</p><p>on my list start watching the video</p><p>start getting educated on what you need</p><p>to do but you definitely need some</p><p>serious changes with your eating plan</p><p>but I create you being honest Thank You</p><p>Evelyn okay we have one egg bacon half</p><p>tomato totally fine not a problem with</p><p>this breakfast make sure you put no</p><p>sweeteners in the coffee unless it&rsquo;s a</p><p>little I think maybe this is some rye</p><p>cracker I&rsquo;m not sure what that that is</p><p>with cumin tomato salad with lettuce</p><p>okay so this this is good this is good I</p><p>think this is a right cracker thing</p><p>these are salt tannaz are like raisins</p><p>they do have a bit too much sugar so you</p><p>might not want to add that I like the</p><p>roll nuts though I like to stay</p><p>convertibles and fresh fruit so I think</p><p>Evelyn you&rsquo;re real close and again</p><p>you&rsquo;re having vegetables all over the</p><p>place so that&rsquo;s good here&rsquo;s that little</p><p>sheet that I listed and uh I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>every month that I do these webinars I</p><p>always get people a kind of little</p><p>little bonus for being on the website a</p><p>lot of you are taking the wheatgrass</p><p>juice powder um</p><p>if you go to amazon.com and you enter</p><p>the code you you can take $10 off this</p><p>product it&rsquo;s basically uh it&rsquo;s not</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder its wheatgrass</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s not wheatgrass powder its</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder one teaspoon is</p><p>equivalent to fourteen of shots of</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder if their days</p><p>that I don&rsquo;t have enough enough</p><p>vegetables I will do the wheatgrass</p><p>juice powder if I&rsquo;m working out and</p><p>training intensely I&rsquo;ll do two teaspoons</p><p>of the wheatgrass root powder there&rsquo;s a</p><p>it&rsquo;s a bit better than my multivitamin</p><p>mineral super nutrient and the trace</p><p>minerals because it&rsquo;s grown on soils</p><p>that are very fertile with with the</p><p>trace minerals so this is something that</p><p>to really spike like it&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>the best multivitamin mineral that you</p><p>give because there&rsquo;s a trace minerals</p><p>it&rsquo;s super concentrated and it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>taste too bad but when you mix in water</p><p>it&rsquo;s a little clumpy because I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>want so it&rsquo;s it it&rsquo;s the real high</p><p>quality stuff so again this is you can</p><p>have to go to Amazon you click on this</p><p>but all I ask if you get this all I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to ask you is to write an unbiased</p><p>review on this product because I would</p><p>really appreciate that okay so if you</p><p>wanted to test it out but for those that</p><p>are already getting this I&rsquo;m giving you</p><p>a little discount with that each month</p><p>I&rsquo;ll do something like this so it&rsquo;s $10</p><p>off now I&rsquo;m going to answer some</p><p>questions</p><p>okay so Linda&rsquo;s said she&rsquo;s on auto-ship</p><p>for wheatgrass yes so what we&rsquo;ll do</p><p>Linda is call the office and have them</p><p>if you&rsquo;re already in auto-ship will</p><p>allow you to take an additional $10 off</p><p>because I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re getting the</p><p>auto-ship is not on Amazon so call the</p><p>office and I will let them do that just</p><p>tell them I said it&rsquo;s okay okay you also</p><p>mentioned you do the kale shake and</p><p>refrigerate it overnight that is really</p><p>good to do</p><p>because though if you keep a kale shake</p><p>in your refrigerator overnight the</p><p>enzymes help break down the product more</p><p>so it&rsquo;s easier to digest in the morning</p><p>what I&rsquo;m doing now is I&rsquo;m taking the</p><p>kale already chopped up I buy it chopped</p><p>up and then I add I add I&rsquo;m sorry I put</p><p>in the freezer so then I take that</p><p>frozen kale and blend it with fruit it</p><p>really turns out really good okay</p><p>Patricia it&rsquo;s she says it sounds like</p><p>you are recommending a no carb diet what</p><p>if I go to the gym to lift weights and</p><p>play tennis should I have some extra</p><p>carbs so Patricia you&rsquo;re going to get</p><p>your carbs from all those vegetables but</p><p>let&rsquo;s pretend that you&rsquo;re not interested</p><p>in losing weight that you can have more</p><p>fruit carbs but what we&rsquo;re trying to</p><p>avoid is the carbs that turn on the</p><p>sugar quickly the refined grains the</p><p>breads pastas cereal crackers there&rsquo;s</p><p>this thought out there that you need the</p><p>sugar to get energy but you really don&rsquo;t</p><p>because your body will turn that even</p><p>protein into into the sugar that you</p><p>need because your body is always storing</p><p>a certain amount of sugar so it is a</p><p>myth that you need excess sugar for</p><p>energy in fact the excess sugar will</p><p>cause you to become more tired so in</p><p>other words if you consume the excess</p><p>sugar it will take away from your energy</p><p>that it will give you energy okay so let</p><p>me see if I have any other questions</p><p>here</p><p>what type</p><p>diet works good for scleroderma and all</p><p>esophageal stomach intestinal issues</p><p>again you would need to stick with the</p><p>eating plan with the adrenal because</p><p>that&rsquo;s an autoimmune thing but I will</p><p>say intestinal issues do really well on</p><p>cabbage cabbage has certain product of a</p><p>certain chemical in her that is really</p><p>good for the digestive tract let&rsquo;s see</p><p>here Kimberly when a lot of protein in</p><p>my kidneys hurt well then then we know</p><p>that you probably liver case and I would</p><p>consume small months protein three</p><p>ounces that&rsquo;s a situation you don&rsquo;t want</p><p>to consume if you&rsquo;re eating a food and</p><p>you have a reaction to it and we can</p><p>narrow down what kind of body type you</p><p>are based on that so that&rsquo;s actually</p><p>good data also says I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t eat</p><p>a full meal I feel pain around my liver</p><p>and gallbladder well I would love Kim</p><p>for you to send me what you eat so I can</p><p>dissect that and see why that is you may</p><p>need a more of something like some gall</p><p>bladder formula to help loosen up the</p><p>bile ducts to get more vile John says</p><p>his frozen cap on the supermarket okay</p><p>to use in this shake instead of fresh</p><p>yeah because that is fresh it&rsquo;s just</p><p>frozen not a problem</p><p>okay says I love the wheatgrass my</p><p>husband and I have been using it for</p><p>about one year it gives me lots of</p><p>energy yeah the wheatgrass is the is the</p><p>most powerful thing that I have because</p><p>it&rsquo;s so super concentrated and you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting a tremendous amount attrition</p><p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a juice powder</p><p>grown on ancient seabeds so it has all</p><p>the trace minerals but I like that the</p><p>best I I basically take that as my multi</p><p>everything especially when I&rsquo;m working</p><p>out and has a lot of chlorophyll to and</p><p>has no gluten Emily says well I&rsquo;ve</p><p>eventually stopped having intense</p><p>cravings around the monthly cycle if I</p><p>start eating no Emily what we need to do</p><p>is we need to fix your menstrual cycle</p><p>which is then</p><p>your hormones off cause you to crave so</p><p>what I&rsquo;m going to recommend is you take</p><p>the ovary support formula to handle the</p><p>cycle and if you&rsquo;re in the area I&rsquo;ve</p><p>stopped my office let me check you if</p><p>you&rsquo;re not I would take the ovary</p><p>formula because it&rsquo;s not really a food</p><p>issue it&rsquo;s a menstrual cycle issue that</p><p>we need to solve by fixing the ovarian</p><p>output of estrogen sarah says I</p><p>developed a yeast yeast infection but we</p><p>could go let there after starting</p><p>nutritional yeast I highly doubt that</p><p>the yeast infection that you have is</p><p>coming from your nutritional yeast</p><p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually not something</p><p>that is going to give you yeast you have</p><p>a balance of good yeast and unfriendly</p><p>yeast a good use will only provide the</p><p>good use it will not add the bad yeast</p><p>in there the yeast infections usually</p><p>come from something that&rsquo;s destroying</p><p>the natural good yeast inside your</p><p>system so I have a hard time believing</p><p>it came from that uh Kimberly says where</p><p>do I send my data information I would</p><p>call my office on the website in and get</p><p>roxanna&rsquo;s email she can be she&rsquo;s my</p><p>communicator and I get all the emails to</p><p>her okay supplements for a diabetic</p><p>besides nutritional yeast</p><p>I should probably create a video on that</p><p>but definitely number one my adrenal day</p><p>formula</p><p>an old Patriot trophy get that for my</p><p>office that&rsquo;s good for a pankratov in PG</p><p>write that down and I would do those two</p><p>things that would help your blood</p><p>Sugar&rsquo;s and support healthy sugars hair</p><p>thinning well you have to watch the next</p><p>video that I have a next Tuesday I&rsquo;ll</p><p>release that one own hair I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>talk about how to get your hair really</p><p>solid in fact uh I use it on my wife and</p><p>it worked very well in she&rsquo;s 52 and she</p><p>started losing hair I gave her this egg</p><p>boom hair came right back okay I have a</p><p>friend who had a pinched nerve at l5 now</p><p>getting a foot drop I recommend her to</p><p>take on ik minimalist Bao salts any</p><p>recommendation well foot drop usually is</p><p>coming from some type of pinched nerve</p><p>at l5 if there&rsquo;s no injury involved it</p><p>could be virus related and that&rsquo;s why</p><p>the trace minerals help because trace</p><p>minerals put viruses back in remission</p><p>okay Jim says any recommendations for</p><p>food to eat when you&rsquo;re on the road</p><p>travel lot that&rsquo;s cheese celery fruit</p><p>apples okay John if I could see</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder with the BT need</p><p>for organic cruciferous food don&rsquo;t like</p><p>to eat a lot of vegetables well the it&rsquo;s</p><p>the best way to get your nutrition from</p><p>the wheatgrass other than eating the</p><p>vegetables so yes that would be an</p><p>alternative because think about it</p><p>one teaspoon is equal to four 14 shots</p><p>of wheatgrass juice 14 shots of</p><p>wheatgrass juice that is like equivalent</p><p>to a huge tray of wheatgrass 20 by 10</p><p>inches 20 inches by 10 inches in one</p><p>teaspoon so if you had one of those you</p><p>did getting every single nutrient you</p><p>would need including all the fat almost</p><p>all the fat soluble vitamins in one</p><p>teaspoon and you put that in water and</p><p>slug it down and you&rsquo;ll start feeling a</p><p>lot more energy let&rsquo;s see</p><p>Beatrice says of 16 a probably a mix</p><p>between adrenal and estrogen I do not</p><p>like dairy except full fat cheese&rsquo;s</p><p>would you Rebecca how hood</p><p>say how would you recommend getting</p><p>enough calcium well I would get it from</p><p>you don&rsquo;t like well get the full fatty</p><p>cheese&rsquo;s I would eat the cheese that</p><p>cheese feta cheese I would also get</p><p>something called kefir playing keeper</p><p>but also if you want to get your calcium</p><p>that realize that you&rsquo;re going to need</p><p>vitamin D and vitamin k2 I have some</p><p>videos on that so instead of trying to</p><p>add more calcium get the vitamins that</p><p>transport calcium in the bones will be</p><p>much much better especially if you&rsquo;re 60</p><p>ok so Bradley a teaspoon of turmeric and</p><p>a half glass of water orange juice at</p><p>night also do now that&rsquo;s tumeric is</p><p>totally fine it&rsquo;s a really good product</p><p>I like that not a problem</p><p>Debbie says is it necessary worry about</p><p>calories no it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s the type of</p><p>food that you need not the calories ok</p><p>so I would recommend basically sticking</p><p>with what I talked about here and you&rsquo;ll</p><p>come out ahead but don&rsquo;t worry about the</p><p>calories so it&rsquo;s been an hour and I want</p><p>to thank everyone for coming out of the</p><p>cemetery like I will continue to do</p><p>these monthly just to share some good</p><p>information and I&rsquo;ll leave this up for a</p><p>couple minutes</p><p>uh if you want to test out the</p><p>wheatgrass juice you can order that you</p><p>have to go to amazon.com and just type</p><p>under wheatgrass juice dr. Berg and</p><p>it&rsquo;ll pop right out ok have a wonderful</p><p>evening</p><p>and I will talk to you very soon all</p><p>right thank thanks for your interest</p><p>everyone</p><p>you</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
