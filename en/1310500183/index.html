    <p>The following is a conversation with George St. Pierre, considered by many to be the greatest</p>
<p>fighter in the history of UFC and MMA, but even more than that, one of the greatest martial</p>
<p>artists ever.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Allform, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, Theragun, and The Information.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that getting the chance to hang out with George, talk to him</p>
<p>on the podcast, record a quick self defense video that I&rsquo;ll release soon, all while</p>
<p>both of us wearing suits was one of the most memorable days of my life.</p>
<p>In setting all this up, I talked to Joe Rogan and originally we couldn&rsquo;t schedule a chat</p>
<p>with him and George on the JRE, which allowed me to pretend for a brief time that George</p>
<p>came down to Austin just to see me.</p>
<p>Who the hell am I?</p>
<p>In truth, him and Joe probably conspired to make me feel special, but that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspiring to see George and Joe, who are at the top of their field, treat others</p>
<p>as equals, as human beings, no matter who they are, even silly Russians in a suit.</p>
<p>Meeting George was an honor for me beyond words.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here&rsquo;s my conversation with my longtime martial arts</p>
<p>hero and now my friend, Mr. George St. Pierre.</p>
<p>In your fighting career, were you more motivated by the love of winning or the fear and hatred</p>
<p>of losing?</p>
<p>I like to win better than I hate to lose because if it would not have been the case, I would</p>
<p>never have fought in the first place because I don&rsquo;t like to fight at all.</p>
<p>But you talked about the anxiety, the fear that you experienced leading up to a fight.</p>
<p>So to you, ultimately the reason to go through that difficult process is because it feels</p>
<p>damn good to have your hand raised?</p>
<p>There is that.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that martial art, I&rsquo;ve been introduced when I was very young and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the best thing I can do in my life, fighting, that&rsquo;s what I do best.</p>
<p>Also, it provides me of freedom, of access of things that most of people do not have,</p>
<p>but all that as a price and a lot of money, I made a lot of money, of course, with it.</p>
<p>I was maybe predisposed with certain abilities.</p>
<p>I met incredible mentors throughout my life.</p>
<p>I worked really hard and of course, I had a lot of chances.</p>
<p>The stars were all aligned and in order to keep that those advantages of freedom, money</p>
<p>and glory and access of things that most people don&rsquo;t have and have these dream life that</p>
<p>I have, I had to sacrifice myself and fight in order to keep it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to understand because I also believe most fighters are not like me.</p>
<p>A lot of guys, because I corner a lot of guys and it seems to me that they love their job.</p>
<p>They enjoyed to go fight in the cage.</p>
<p>I love to train.</p>
<p>I love the science of fighting, the sport, to be in good shape, the confidence that training</p>
<p>and mixed martial art give me.</p>
<p>However, I do not like the feeling of uncertainty, the stress that I have, not knowing if I will</p>
<p>be badly injured or humiliated or winning the fight.</p>
<p>To me, I&rsquo;m bearable and that&rsquo;s what takes the most out of me.</p>
<p>More than brain damage, more than anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what takes the most out of me.</p>
<p>But the thing you get from it is the freedom that you get because of the money, but because</p>
<p>of the celebrity, because of everything that comes with it.</p>
<p>So you can be the best version of yourself because of fighting.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you&rsquo;ve said that, quote, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s pleasure in life.</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s only a relief from pain.</p>
<p>We have to suffer to be on top.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t there something to just the suffering in itself?</p>
<p>Just doing really difficult shit just to get to the top?</p>
<p>To explain that and so people can relate to it because not everybody&rsquo;s a fighter.</p>
<p>I think the best example I can give is let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re, you haven&rsquo;t eat for a long time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re craving, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re suffering.</p>
<p>And then when it&rsquo;s time to eat, finally, you&rsquo;re about to eat your favorite dish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to taste so much better.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I believe there is always some sort of sacrifice before the pleasure.</p>
<p>And the more sacrifice you do, like they say in fighting, the bigger the risk, the bigger</p>
<p>is the reward.</p>
<p>And I feel that&rsquo;s how it is for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel that with, I started fasting a little bit in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing as amazing as a delicious meal or anything, actually anything, any food</p>
<p>when you haven&rsquo;t eaten for several days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not incredible in this simple way of finally I get to eat.</p>
<p>You get to truly experience the beauty of what it is to be alive.</p>
<p>Like that little piece of food, you see all the flavors, you feel just the experience</p>
<p>of it is ultimately of gratitude of how awesome it is to be alive.</p>
<p>But when you eat many times a day and you&rsquo;re pigging out and you don&rsquo;t get to experience</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really like fasting is one of the most accessible things for people, I think to experience</p>
<p>that kind of pairing of hardship to pleasure.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And in my case, it changed my life on a good way.</p>
<p>I cannot recommend it to people because everybody is different.</p>
<p>But to fight Michael Bisping, my last fight was against the champion in the heavier weight</p>
<p>class that I used to compete at.</p>
<p>So I thought that if I would gain weight, it would increase my performance.</p>
<p>And I struggled a lot to gain weight.</p>
<p>I gained about eight to 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Normally I walk around 185 pounds.</p>
<p>And for that fight, I was walking around 195.</p>
<p>However, I forced myself to eat like six times a day.</p>
<p>I was on a very strict diet and it didn&rsquo;t feel right to me because I feel like I was</p>
<p>carrying like a little bit like I was carrying a bag on my shoulder.</p>
<p>And I think it was a bad idea for me because when I did the weigh in and I went on a scale</p>
<p>at 185, I couldn&rsquo;t go back to my initial weight that was 195 that I worked so hard for several</p>
<p>months to get there.</p>
<p>So I was 190 pounds, but I couldn&rsquo;t get back.</p>
<p>And the morning of the fight, I got sick.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know what it was in the beginning because in order to know, to find out what</p>
<p>it was, I needed to do what they call a colonoscopy.</p>
<p>They put a camera inside of you and to do that, they give you something that makes that</p>
<p>empty you.</p>
<p>And I was trying to gain weight, not to lose weight.</p>
<p>So I told myself I&rsquo;m going to wait after the fight, whatever it is, because it was pretty</p>
<p>bad.</p>
<p>It was blood.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know what I was.</p>
<p>I was very concerned.</p>
<p>I thought I had maybe cancer.</p>
<p>I was freaking out.</p>
<p>So I said, I&rsquo;m going to do that fight.</p>
<p>And then after right away, I&rsquo;m going to make a checkup.</p>
<p>So I did the fight.</p>
<p>Everything went well.</p>
<p>I won the fight.</p>
<p>I went back home.</p>
<p>I did a colonoscopy and I got diagnosed with ulcer colitis.</p>
<p>Then I got on very severe medication to get better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a big fan of medication.</p>
<p>I was trying to look for more natural way to get better.</p>
<p>And I found out about fasting and it really changed my life.</p>
<p>I met Dr. Jason Fong, who was one of the world authority of fasting.</p>
<p>He treat diabetes patient with fasting and he gave me a program of fasting and it really</p>
<p>changed my life.</p>
<p>And right away what I did is I went in a CAT scan to see the difference because it was</p>
<p>right after my fight with Michael Bisping and I did the CAT scan.</p>
<p>So I had my muscle mass, bone density, fat percentage, water retention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>It can show you which harm has more muscle than the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very precise.</p>
<p>And I did it like two months after.</p>
<p>So I started doing time restricted eating, 16 eight.</p>
<p>But right away when I started, I did three days water fast.</p>
<p>And the Dr. Jason Fong, he said, because I like to train during those days, I consume</p>
<p>Himalayan salt to make sure, because when you sweat, there&rsquo;s a lot of minerals to make</p>
<p>sure you don&rsquo;t deplete your mineral.</p>
<p>And when I compared the two results in the CAT scan, I found out my biggest concern was</p>
<p>to lose muscle mass.</p>
<p>I found out that I did not lose muscle mass.</p>
<p>Instead of losing it, it increased a little bit.</p>
<p>Even though my weight on the scale was lighter, I kept the same muscle mass even increases</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>My bone density increases a little bit.</p>
<p>My water retention is the biggest thing that decrease.</p>
<p>So my inflammation and my fat percentage.</p>
<p>So basically by looking at the data, I found out that by eating so much, trying to gain</p>
<p>weight to fight Michael Bisping, it only increases my water retention, which is not good because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dead weight and inflammation on you.</p>
<p>So what was the actual process of fasting?</p>
<p>You said 16, eight time restricted, so intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>But you also mentioned the three hour, the three day water fast.</p>
<p>What did that feel like?</p>
<p>And you also said training during the three day?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How did that feel?</p>
<p>Can you give me some details of, this is fascinating.</p>
<p>So I do three days water fast, four times a year.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>For me, I do it, everybody is different, but for me, I do it after New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Because during the holidays, that&rsquo;s when I eat bad foods and I drink.</p>
<p>I see it more like a cleansing, like a detox, so to speak.</p>
<p>Mental too, like psychological.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I do it after the New Year&rsquo;s, right before the summer, cut for the beach.</p>
<p>After the summer, because of the summer, I&rsquo;ve been partying a little bit sometimes, let</p>
<p>myself go.</p>
<p>And right before the holidays.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve tried, Dr. Phuong, he says to me, said, George, everybody&rsquo;s different because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very active person and everybody has a different genetics.</p>
<p>So for me, I feel that three days is the sweet spot because I still train during those three</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>The first day, the first two days, I don&rsquo;t change nothing.</p>
<p>I train on my regular schedule.</p>
<p>However, on the third day, I modify a little bit.</p>
<p>I do something more easy and that&rsquo;s how I do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve tried before, because when I say three days is my sweet spot, I&rsquo;ve tried to</p>
<p>go up to five days.</p>
<p>But the problem is after my third days, I found out that I had a big problem sleeping.</p>
<p>I get into a hyperactive mode.</p>
<p>They call that the hunter gatherer mode, you know, like your brain, I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Your creativity is at its peak, but you cannot sleep very well.</p>
<p>And sleeping for me, I think it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I do three days for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my sweet spot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the four or five days when you start, see sleep is not important for me.</p>
<p>So the creativity is really important.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very interesting the places your mind goes after a few days.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I mean, what does it do to your mind?</p>
<p>So you mentioned your body likes it.</p>
<p>In terms of training, do you find that it helps you focus and think?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re one of the great strategic thinkers in terms of martial arts.</p>
<p>Does it help with learning?</p>
<p>Does it help with thinking?</p>
<p>Does it help with strategizing and all of that?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, I got into fasting after I retired.</p>
<p>I really wish people asked me, would you have done it during the time that you competed?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>I think we live in a society that we&rsquo;re bombarded by publicity.</p>
<p>Oh, buy this, eat protein, this, that.</p>
<p>And fasting, nobody makes money with it because there&rsquo;s nothing to sell.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why a lot of people have not heard about it.</p>
<p>And even for myself, if someone would have talked to me about the benefits of fasting</p>
<p>when I was training before I got sick, I would probably have ignored him because it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to believe.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to help your mind and you&rsquo;re going to gain muscle potentially.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And perhaps people have talked to me about it, but it went in one of my ears and got</p>
<p>out from the other side, you know?</p>
<p>But it really changed my life.</p>
<p>And I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it helps me get rid of all my symptoms.</p>
<p>What I do is, I know a lot of people have ulcerative colitis and for me, I cannot recommend</p>
<p>it to other people because everybody is different.</p>
<p>But for me, I made a lot of research of how people from ulcerative colitis got better.</p>
<p>And I found out that a lot of people that got that condition get better in the natural</p>
<p>way through fasting, eating fermented food, collagen and bone broth and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And it made a huge difference in my life.</p>
<p>I just wish I would have known that before.</p>
<p>So do you have a specific diet wise stuff you like?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve recently, another ridiculous sounding thing, but it makes me feel really good is</p>
<p>very low carbs.</p>
<p>So keto, even carnivore, it sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>But it makes me feel really good, even for performance.</p>
<p>Is Rogan has influenced you?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a carnivore diet.</p>
<p>I was influenced actually by people, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll tell you where, because I was doing it before he was doing it.</p>
<p>It was popular in the endurance athlete community where it was fat adapted athletes, people</p>
<p>who insane people who run 50 miles, 100 miles, they figured out that they could fuel their</p>
<p>body by with fat that can go to fat as the source of energy as opposed to carbs.</p>
<p>So I remember hoping that I&rsquo;ll be able to learn how to run 50 miles and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done more than 22, but it, I just remember switching away from carbs and feeling</p>
<p>really liberated.</p>
<p>Like I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about food as much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to eat once a day and feel really good.</p>
<p>I mean, I think every everybody&rsquo;s body is different, but I think carbs make me lazy.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because the crash, yeah, it&rsquo;s the crash, but also just psychologically something</p>
<p>it it forces me to also think about food too much.</p>
<p>Like it starts becoming, you know, our logistic, you said our society is so much about food.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many ads, so much advertisement and so much of our social life is about food.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very easy to live life, like live day to day thinking, when is the next meal?</p>
<p>Like what am I going to eat for lunch?</p>
<p>What am I going to eat for dinner?</p>
<p>What am I going to eat for breakfast?</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not careful, that&rsquo;s going to get in the way of you doing cool shit for</p>
<p>like liberating yourself and thinking like, what am I actually passionate about in this</p>
<p>life?</p>
<p>Like creating and forgetting to eat those kinds of things and still being able to fuel</p>
<p>your body.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been fascinating to, to figure out like later in life that carbs aren&rsquo;t necessary</p>
<p>to function.</p>
<p>Well, it makes me think like, we don&rsquo;t know anything about nutrition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, personally, I don&rsquo;t think I could have a diet without carbs.</p>
<p>I love chocolate too much.</p>
<p>For me eating, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a pleasure of life.</p>
<p>I love my carbs.</p>
<p>I love my sugar.</p>
<p>However, if you talk about that, I don&rsquo;t have a specific diet, but recently I, what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to do is the days that I do not work out, I only eat once.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of my rules.</p>
<p>Plus I try to respect 16 eight and do my three day fast, uh, uh, four times a year.</p>
<p>But the rest of the thing, I, I, I, I let myself loose because I, I don&rsquo;t think I would</p>
<p>be happy if I, if I, uh, if I, if I don&rsquo;t give myself the, the, the, the right to, to</p>
<p>eat for me personally, I love to eat so much next.</p>
<p>And you talk about a diet, carnivore diet is very interesting because I, um, a few years</p>
<p>ago I went to Africa in, uh, Masai Mara and, uh, it&rsquo;s a tribe in, uh, in, in, uh, East</p>
<p>Africa and, um, I want to visit them.</p>
<p>I did a safari and I talked to them and these guys, they, their diet is 99% carnivore.</p>
<p>They they, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And you should see they&rsquo;re very beautiful people shredded.</p>
<p>Some people would say, Oh, it&rsquo;s genetic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s genetic.</p>
<p>But I mean, think about the Eskimos also that like most of their diet is on, on fish, right?</p>
<p>They, they, so I believe it can be done, you know, like, I believe it can be done and like</p>
<p>an exclusive carnivore diet.</p>
<p>And I, I think I&rsquo;m going to try it pretty soon just to have the experience, you know,</p>
<p>to see how it feels like.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re going to hang out with Joe, uh, be careful bringing it up because he&rsquo;ll convince</p>
<p>you to, uh, forever switch to carnivore.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>He loves it.</p>
<p>I mean, but just like you, I think he loves food.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, he can&rsquo;t ever stay on carnivore.</p>
<p>It was funny cause we went to an Italian restaurant together and I still only eat meat.</p>
<p>Like I love, um, I love the constraints of discipline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s partially why I like carnivore.</p>
<p>I like saying no to food that is delicious.</p>
<p>But a part of the problem is that I don&rsquo;t know how to moderate.</p>
<p>You said chocolate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to have one chocolate.</p>
<p>Is that something you&rsquo;re able to do?</p>
<p>Have like in moderation?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s when it, when I have an opportunity, I do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any, I&rsquo;m an extremist person, uh, Lex, I, I, that&rsquo;s the thing I, when I,</p>
<p>when I have a chance, I, I like, I, I just eat, I go too much.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I like about my life, you know, that&rsquo;s what I like about fasting.</p>
<p>Because probably if I would not have discovered fasting, eating chocolate would give me cramps</p>
<p>and all sorts of problems because people on ulcer colitis, normally they cannot eat chocolate.</p>
<p>They cannot drink alcohol.</p>
<p>But I believe because I&rsquo;m fasting, that&rsquo;s the reason why I&rsquo;m medication, medicine, medication</p>
<p>free.</p>
<p>I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want, but I have to do that, that fasting, you know,</p>
<p>and now it becomes to a, it became to a point that it&rsquo;s no longer hard for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like normal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even force myself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Some of my friends thinks I&rsquo;m, think I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m insane, you know, but I tell them it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like with, when you get used to it, it becomes like an habit.</p>
<p>And, and I&rsquo;m, and I know that hunter gatherer, like our ancestor did not eat three times</p>
<p>a day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>They, they ate one day they could, and when they eat, they, they, they, they feed themselves</p>
<p>as much as they can until that, because the next time, because they didn&rsquo;t know when they,</p>
<p>they could eat again.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re built, you know, to, to, to have this</p>
<p>similar lifestyle.</p>
<p>If we could take a step back to the discussion about fear a little bit.</p>
<p>So Mike Tyson talks about this process of him walking to the ring.</p>
<p>He sounds similar to you in many ways of the anxiety and the fear that he experiences.</p>
<p>And he has this sort of story that he tells about walking to the ring and being supremely</p>
<p>afraid.</p>
<p>But as he walks and gets closer and steps in, he finds the confidence and becomes supremely</p>
<p>confident.</p>
<p>I think he calls himself like a God.</p>
<p>I feel like a God in the ring.</p>
<p>Is, is, do you go through a similar process of finding the confidence?</p>
<p>Well, it, yes.</p>
<p>And I use, I use a James Lange theory that they did.</p>
<p>So what I do is because I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not afraid to admit that I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>And in the beginning of my career, I really thought I asked myself, because I was very</p>
<p>good in mixed martial, but I, I really thought I wasn&rsquo;t made for this because the idea of</p>
<p>fighting didn&rsquo;t, was, was, didn&rsquo;t make me happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something like I, I was, I was forced to do in order to keep that lifestyle that</p>
<p>I have and achieve my goal.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day to make enough money to retire and you know, that, that was my dream.</p>
<p>But when I was looking around the gym where I was training, most of my training partner,</p>
<p>they were happy.</p>
<p>They were excited.</p>
<p>And sometime I corner, I corner a lot of guys and they&rsquo;re happy and they&rsquo;re in the locker</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t react the same way I do.</p>
<p>Some perhaps does, but if you see me in the locker room, like when I get like my last</p>
<p>fight with Michael Bisping, just to give you an example in my last fight with Michael Bisping,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fresh, it&rsquo;s the one that is the most recent and, but it&rsquo;s always the same</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>My last fight in Bisping, I get in the locker room, I like three guys that I train with,</p>
<p>Mickey Gall, Eamon Zahabi and Joseph Duffy.</p>
<p>They all lost.</p>
<p>It was like, like my, my locker room was basically cursed.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re in a locker room and people from your locker room leave for a fight</p>
<p>and then they come back, it&rsquo;s kind of a momentum, you know, you, you, you shake and yeah, good</p>
<p>job.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s my turn.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of a team brotherhood sort of thing.</p>
<p>So the, the, the, the atmosphere in my locker room was pretty bad.</p>
<p>It was like going to a, you know, like a funeral.</p>
<p>So I was very scared and before every fight, I asked myself, I asked myself always, shit,</p>
<p>what the hell I&rsquo;m doing here?</p>
<p>Why did I choose to come back?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m freaking out.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m putting on a mask like I&rsquo;m acting because if I don&rsquo;t do that, it will reflect</p>
<p>on my coaches.</p>
<p>And if my coach, my, my, the confidence of my coaches is affected, it will reflect, reflect</p>
<p>on me.</p>
<p>So I need to feel strong.</p>
<p>I need to make them believe that I&rsquo;m excited to be there and I&rsquo;m happy to be there.</p>
<p>So this sort of play start when I get, when I first step in the locker room, even though</p>
<p>I feel completely different, but that&rsquo;s how I play it.</p>
<p>Normally the day, the fight day, I never fell, feel a hundred percent.</p>
<p>I always feel exhausted, tired.</p>
<p>My highs are hitching because I don&rsquo;t sleep enough the few nights before, because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>constantly rehearse, rehearsing scenarios that might happen in the fight.</p>
<p>So mentally it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not on top, but you keep all that to yourself.</p>
<p>I keep it to myself and I&rsquo;m lying to everybody around me.</p>
<p>But everybody knows, you know, fair ass John De Niro, they know Freddie Rose, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been with me for a long time, so they know what&rsquo;s going on, but at least I&rsquo;m lying to</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m feeling great.</p>
<p>So, and seeing all my training partner, like very disappointed because they lost our fight.</p>
<p>Some were badly hurt as well.</p>
<p>It was hard.</p>
<p>So I remember I started to warm up and everything.</p>
<p>And as you start to warm up, you become a different person because we know that certain</p>
<p>posture and yoga can affect your mental state.</p>
<p>But I would say it&rsquo;s a little bit the same thing in fighting, you know, like when you</p>
<p>started hitting the pads, your muscle memory, your instincts comes back and you remember</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re good at this, you know, and your confidence start to grow.</p>
<p>And as seeing your trainers holding the pad and repeating your moves, it makes you also</p>
<p>remember all the sacrifice you have done through your training camp and confidence come from</p>
<p>how you prepared yourself.</p>
<p>And even you&rsquo;re afraid, you can be confident in the same time.</p>
<p>Being afraid and being confident is two different things.</p>
<p>And before every fight, just right before I walk in, when I&rsquo;m scared, I go in the bathroom</p>
<p>and I look at myself in the mirror.</p>
<p>I used to have a bandana and a gi, but now I didn&rsquo;t have this for my last fight because</p>
<p>of the new Reebok deal they had.</p>
<p>But I did the same rehearsal that I always do.</p>
<p>I look at myself in the mirror and I start to compliment myself.</p>
<p>Like even if I don&rsquo;t believe it, I&rsquo;m starting to trying to believe it as I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding all the reasons why I&rsquo;m going to win the fight.</p>
<p>And all my trainer knows that before every fight, when the guy from the UFC goes and</p>
<p>Steppen Maroon says, St. Pierre, you&rsquo;re up next, I always take a few minutes to do that</p>
<p>same rehearsal.</p>
<p>And I tell myself I&rsquo;m going to win this fight because I&rsquo;m better and I&rsquo;m very cocky about</p>
<p>myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling all the reasons that I&rsquo;m going to win.</p>
<p>I got a better team.</p>
<p>I made more sacrifice, you know, I&rsquo;m faster, I&rsquo;m more powerful, way more athletic.</p>
<p>My fighting IQ is better than him.</p>
<p>I got a strategy on point that he&rsquo;s never going to be able to keep up with and this</p>
<p>and that.</p>
<p>And I was telling myself, I&rsquo;m going to show these young kids how things should be done.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m trying to boost myself.</p>
<p>Try to boost yourself and you start to believe in it.</p>
<p>You become a different person.</p>
<p>So when you walk out the bathroom, now rock and roll, now I really believe it for real.</p>
<p>You know, like I&rsquo;m still scared, but I believe it for real.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the transformation that happened for me right there.</p>
<p>And from that from now, from from there to the fight, it&rsquo;s until the fight is over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called I call it cruise control because you don&rsquo;t have time to think in a fight.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to think, you&rsquo;re missing the opportunity.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I see it for myself.</p>
<p>So at that point, you stop thinking and you just go cruise control, autopilot.</p>
<p>Trust yourself, you know, trust yourself because you repeated all the scenarios, you know.</p>
<p>So everything that you have done, it&rsquo;s inside your computer.</p>
<p>Your computer, your brain is programmed to react accordingly to certain situations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the night of the fight that you will tell yourself, oh, finally, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to do this.</p>
<p>If you do this now.</p>
<p>No, if you have not practiced it before, you&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>The preparation, the repetition that makes it happen, you know.</p>
<p>What about like the really difficult moments in a fight where you are tested to your limits,</p>
<p>essentially?</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s cardio related exhaustion, right?</p>
<p>Where you have to ask yourself that same question is like, why the hell am I doing this?</p>
<p>Do you experience those or are you able to ride through the autopilot?</p>
<p>And if you do, like, what do you do in those moments?</p>
<p>Never in a fight.</p>
<p>In a fight when the fight is on, I never change my mind, I go until the end.</p>
<p>However, for example, my first fight with BJ Penn, I had a terrible first round.</p>
<p>So I had to switch gear.</p>
<p>That happened sometimes, but it&rsquo;s part of my plan.</p>
<p>I always have a plan B, plan A, plan B, plan C. You need to have that.</p>
<p>If fighters go into a fight thinking, oh, I&rsquo;m going to do this, this, this, and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a plan B, if this doesn&rsquo;t work, that means they&rsquo;re not well prepared.</p>
<p>If you talk to me before every fight, I can, like in 30 seconds, give you my old strategy.</p>
<p>You know, for BJ Penn, my first fight with BJ Penn was, oh, I&rsquo;m going to keep it standing</p>
<p>up, keep the fight from the outside, you know, because I&rsquo;m faster than him.</p>
<p>Then the fight with BJ Penn started.</p>
<p>I found out that I was not faster than him.</p>
<p>And I found out that his reaction time was better than mine.</p>
<p>So I got beat up the first round and I got a bloody nose and everything.</p>
<p>So my plan B was now I&rsquo;m going to wrestle him, you know, I&rsquo;m going to wrestle him and,</p>
<p>you know, make him tired and trying to put him down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I beat him because I switched gear, you know?</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t do that, if you cannot find a way to become the perfect nemesis to your</p>
<p>opponent, you might win a few fights, but you&rsquo;re going to find, you&rsquo;re going to fight</p>
<p>someone sooner or later that will, that will give you a lot of, a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the anxiety pays off.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re anticipating all the ways it goes wrong.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve developed a plan B and plan C. You know, we talked a lot with, like John Donoher,</p>
<p>who you work with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard him talk about plan B and plan C. He usually has a really clear</p>
<p>plan A, an entire system of plan A. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard him, we&rsquo;ve had a good discussion</p>
<p>about it in, over some cheeseburgers.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s, he was kind of espousing the value of mastering escapes.</p>
<p>So when you find yourself in bad situations, being exceptionally good at finding ways out</p>
<p>of those bad situations, and that&rsquo;s a way of dominance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, there&rsquo;s no better way to dominate your opponent according to him than</p>
<p>to show that they can&rsquo;t possibly hurt you no matter how bad the position is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a, as opposed to a physical dominance, it&rsquo;s a psychological dominance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>But I wonder if he has plan B and plan C in his mind too.</p>
<p>You know, in mixed martial arts, sometimes it&rsquo;s like in science, sometimes you can make</p>
<p>a mistake, you know, like every human can make mistakes, you know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain sport or a certain situation that you, if there&rsquo;s a mistake made, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it exactly.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the case in MMA, but sometimes you&rsquo;re able to redeem yourself.</p>
<p>And if you look the fight with BJ Penn 1 that I had, which was probably one of the most</p>
<p>competitive fight and it was probably the, it was the fight that I got the most damage</p>
<p>and I was messed up.</p>
<p>It took me three days, like two, three days to recuperate from that fight.</p>
<p>I was really damaged.</p>
<p>And my first fight versus my second fight, I made a lot of adjustment because I have</p>
<p>learned from my first fight.</p>
<p>And also I had a guy, one thing people don&rsquo;t know, like they talk about fighters having</p>
<p>secret weapons.</p>
<p>See, for me, my secret weapons was not like some is that they use like certain, like different</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>For me, it was knowledge.</p>
<p>I had a guy in Montreal, he was measuring frames.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a scientist, he&rsquo;s a friend of Ferras and I.</p>
<p>And what he does, he watch fight and he measure frames.</p>
<p>The way he does it is when you watch a fight and one of the guy throw a punch, he cut</p>
<p>the picture by frame, the video by frame.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s able to see which fighter has better reaction time than others.</p>
<p>And BJ Penn, he found out that BJ Penn of all the UFC roster at the time when he was</p>
<p>in his prime, he had probably the best reaction time of all.</p>
<p>According to him, Lyoto Machido was the second one, but BJ Penn was the first one.</p>
<p>So I knew that if I would try to go first, because I always been the fastest guy normally</p>
<p>when I fight someone.</p>
<p>But when I fought BJ Penn, I tried to go first and he was always able to like, I never was</p>
<p>never able to touch him with my jab and he came back with a counter punch.</p>
<p>However, because of what he told me, I knew that BJ Penn has a very fast reaction time,</p>
<p>but had a very poor reset time.</p>
<p>To him, the way he described it to me is like your nervous system is like a muscle.</p>
<p>BJ Penn was so fast, but he&rsquo;s like more like a sprinter.</p>
<p>So when I did the second fight, when I fought BJ Penn, I made him flinch.</p>
<p>Like I fake a lot.</p>
<p>So I make him react and flinch.</p>
<p>So all that reaction time that he used to flinch was not used properly to avoid my punches.</p>
<p>So I burn, I load up his nervous system with a lot of information and fake and to make</p>
<p>him flinch and pretending I was kicking and wrestling.</p>
<p>So he got overwhelmed and he got tired very, very fast.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I beat him.</p>
<p>People sometimes they don&rsquo;t know really what&rsquo;s the strategy behind the thing.</p>
<p>They only see the physical part.</p>
<p>But when you fight someone, if I fight you, I look at you in the eyes, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things that going on between you and I.</p>
<p>I can look down here, bam, jab you in the face.</p>
<p>The audience will not see these little detail, but you will see it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes the magic during a fight.</p>
<p>The relation that you have with the opponent, you know, like the mental game, what you make</p>
<p>him believe.</p>
<p>Those little things, I use a lot of those.</p>
<p>If you talk to a lot of my opponents, they&rsquo;ll tell you, like, I use a lot of these little</p>
<p>things, you know, like I look down at Banner, I go up or I am pretending I want to attack</p>
<p>you so I make you flinch, but in reality, I&rsquo;m just doing this because I want to rest.</p>
<p>I want to recuperate and I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>How much is, you know, people talk about that with poker, for example.</p>
<p>How much is the value of this?</p>
<p>You know, so like some people argue that poker is more about the betting, you know, just</p>
<p>the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just how much you bet and so on.</p>
<p>So that would be more like the analogy there with with fighting would be just strictly</p>
<p>the physical movement of your body.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people argue that there&rsquo;s a lot here in the way you look and the little</p>
<p>movements in the face.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s, do you think you&rsquo;re communicating with your opponent when you</p>
<p>look at them?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to know for sure, 100 percent.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m by no, no mean psychic, nothing like that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe in that at all.</p>
<p>The only thing is I know through looking through the eyes of my opponent when he&rsquo;s afraid and</p>
<p>when he gives up on me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been accused very often in my career to not take enough risk, to not finish my</p>
<p>opponent.</p>
<p>But the reason why I didn&rsquo;t finish my opponent is because I saw in his eyes that he gave</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>He gave me the fight and I&rsquo;m winning the fight.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not up to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to me to make it, to try to sacrifice myself trying to finish him.</p>
<p>Perhaps if I do that, I will open up for him to capitalize on my mistake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to him to make a risk.</p>
<p>So people sometimes they don&rsquo;t understand that is the art of fighting, my friend, you</p>
<p>know, like if I&rsquo;m winning the fight like an hockey, an ice hockey, if you&rsquo;re winning the</p>
<p>game and it&rsquo;s the third period, it&rsquo;s at the end of the third period, you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to take out your goaltender trying to score another goal because winning five to three</p>
<p>or five to four is the same thing.</p>
<p>Same thing in MMA.</p>
<p>We make a living out of this.</p>
<p>And sometimes as bad as it can be, you want to save yourself for another day, you know,</p>
<p>you want to minimize the damage.</p>
<p>But if he knows he&rsquo;s losing the fight, it&rsquo;s up to him to take the risk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not up to me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a good counter fighter.</p>
<p>I use a lot of my attack or counter strike or reactive take down or proactive take down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my specialty.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to I have no desire to sacrifice myself trying to try to finish my opponent</p>
<p>if he want to, if perhaps I might give him the opportunity to capitalize on me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not smart to do that.</p>
<p>And very often when I fight someone, I can read him, I see the fear in his eyes.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m like, I got you now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very desperate.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to put my guard down because he&rsquo;s going to be desperate.</p>
<p>But I know I&rsquo;m beating you.</p>
<p>And I know I&rsquo;m beating you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to do what I need.</p>
<p>You know, if I have a chance, of course, I&rsquo;ll knock him out.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to try to sacrifice myself to knock him out.</p>
<p>And if you do that, maybe one day you&rsquo;ll make a mistake and you&rsquo;ll get dropped and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll tell yourself, I shoot, I just got brain damage.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m never going to come back the same.</p>
<p>Maybe you know, I ruined my career or, you know, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a very serious game that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dangerous.</p>
<p>In the face of that risk, I mean, Mike Tyson talked about, you know, when the opponent</p>
<p>looks away, he knows he&rsquo;s got him, right, that that he&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>For a person like me who has trouble making eye contact with people, there&rsquo;s truth to</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s truth to that, that there&rsquo;s an animal nature to us looking away.</p>
<p>I mean, you could see that the way the body language, the way the eyes move between two</p>
<p>animals going at it in the wild when like two lions fight or two whatever fight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain beta move when you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve been defeated.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or one thing when I know that, that when it happened, one of the signs is when I just</p>
<p>like make a faint and the guy flinched like crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mean he&rsquo;s really scared of me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re doing this, that guy flinched a little bit</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, that&rsquo;s mean you hurt him and he doesn&rsquo;t want to get hurt again.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s really trying to run away and not not winning the fight anymore, but not losing</p>
<p>sort of surviving the five round.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to to finish a guy who does doesn&rsquo;t want to fight a guy who&rsquo;s not fighting</p>
<p>anymore to win in this fighting to not lose.</p>
<p>And the proof of that, if you don&rsquo;t believe me, just look the reign of all the greatest</p>
<p>champion in UFC.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who they are, John Jones or like you could clearly see that in the beginning</p>
<p>of their reign, they could, you know, finish a lot of their opponents, the same as me in</p>
<p>the beginning.</p>
<p>I was finishing a lot of my opponent.</p>
<p>But there is a time that the entire UFC roster is studying you and they found ways to perhaps</p>
<p>not beating you, but they found a way to navigate to the fight in a way that they minimize the</p>
<p>damage.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big difference between fighting to win and fighting to not lose.</p>
<p>You said that there&rsquo;s a difference between a fighter and a martial artist.</p>
<p>So now we were talking about fighting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re considered by many to be one of the greatest fighters of all time.</p>
<p>But you said that there&rsquo;s a difference between a fighter and a martial artist.</p>
<p>A fighter is training for a purpose.</p>
<p>He has a fight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m a martial artist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t train for a fight.</p>
<p>I train for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m training all the time.</p>
<p>My goal is perfection, but I will never reach perfection.</p>
<p>So what to you does it mean to be a martial artist?</p>
<p>Martial artist is because that lifestyle that I have has been introduced to me and the seed</p>
<p>has been planted to my mind a long, long time ago by my father.</p>
<p>I am I do not train because I have a fight.</p>
<p>I will always train.</p>
<p>Even now, it kind of amused me that to see that a lot of people, because I&rsquo;m still training,</p>
<p>because I love the science of fighting.</p>
<p>I do not like to fight, but I love the science of it.</p>
<p>And I will always do it as long as I can do it.</p>
<p>People think I&rsquo;m going to make a comeback and everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m about to get to have 40 years old.</p>
<p>You know, like it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m, you know, like I don&rsquo;t want to fight in a cage at 40 years</p>
<p>old.</p>
<p>I mean, some people have done it.</p>
<p>They did it very well.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I feel a little bit to me that.</p>
<p>And you never say never feel like to me like it&rsquo;s a little like a kid that you play with</p>
<p>the strain when he&rsquo;s young, like when he&rsquo;s five years old, six years old, seven years</p>
<p>old, eight years old.</p>
<p>But then I was like, what the hell I&rsquo;m doing here?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m too old for this.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>So I have done it, you know, and and I got out of it on top.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m healthy, which is the most important thing right now, touching wood.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m wealthy.</p>
<p>I beat the game.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>In a way, like that&rsquo;s not to be cocky, but I did it.</p>
<p>And I wish more more fighters could do the same thing.</p>
<p>I wish, but it&rsquo;s unfortunate because a lot of them, they stay there and hang out for</p>
<p>too long and they get badly hurt.</p>
<p>They get beaten and broken, you know, and they finish broke as well, because the lifestyle</p>
<p>you have when you&rsquo;re a pro athlete, it&rsquo;s crazy, you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, everything that goes up and life goes down and you need to plan your future,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>And for for me, what if some guys have the same mentality as me and they&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>us right now, I would say if you do it because you&rsquo;re just good at it, you like the money,</p>
<p>the advantage, the freedom that it gives you, but you don&rsquo;t necessarily like to fight.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done, you finish on top, you know, go go cash out and get out of the way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Hard to do.</p>
<p>However, actually, it&rsquo;s not everybody that does it for that reason.</p>
<p>Some people generally love to fight, love to compete.</p>
<p>So they do it because they love it, you know, or they do it because of the money.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t love it, if you don&rsquo;t like to fight because it&rsquo;s very stressful and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t enjoy you, you enjoy the training, perhaps, but you don&rsquo;t like to fight.</p>
<p>You do it because it&rsquo;s part of what you need to do in order to keep that lifestyle.</p>
<p>And you know, like you don&rsquo;t need the money to get out of here, man.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in your you&rsquo;re in your prime, get out of here.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll hurt your own legacy, you&rsquo;ll damage your health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sad and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a sad business, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a lot of what one of the place where is the one of the most happiest place for</p>
<p>me to go and the most saddest place for me to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the gym, Tristar in Montreal, because it&rsquo;s one of the happiest place for me to go</p>
<p>because I can go train and do what I love to do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a very sad place for me because after when I&rsquo;m about to leave, there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>a bunch of young kid that comes or guys that are around 30, 33 years old.</p>
<p>And they come to me and say, hey, George, you have some advice for me.</p>
<p>And I look at them.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re my friend, they&rsquo;re real close friend of mine, I&rsquo;ll tell them the truth in</p>
<p>their face.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done it many times and it was not well received.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re not my friend, I have to, you know, you know, it&rsquo;s always an advice about</p>
<p>fighting and I answer their question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my pleasure.</p>
<p>But the truth, if they they want me to tell the truth, the big majority of them, I would</p>
<p>tell them, I said, listen, man, you&rsquo;re in maybe three, like on a losing street of three</p>
<p>fight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re 30, 33 years old, you know, I think you should think about doing something else</p>
<p>in your life.</p>
<p>You know, I have other goals, you know, because you&rsquo;re not going to make it.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve seen that movie before and it&rsquo;s a very sad ending.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m sad to tell you the truth because you&rsquo;re not going to make the money.</p>
<p>You just choose some.</p>
<p>But if I tell them that they&rsquo;re going to be angry at me because they&rsquo;ll be like, oh, you</p>
<p>you make it and you think I cannot make it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of they&rsquo;re going to think I&rsquo;m cocky.</p>
<p>But I was lucky to make it.</p>
<p>You know, at the start, we&rsquo;re all aligned.</p>
<p>But at one point, you need to be able to to have a plan B, you know, like like some parent</p>
<p>they come to see me with their kids and this is the future world champion in the UFC.</p>
<p>And what advice would you give him?</p>
<p>I always tell the same thing.</p>
<p>And it does not make everybody happy.</p>
<p>When I said I say I go to the case, a are you good at school?</p>
<p>Say stay at school.</p>
<p>School is very important for you.</p>
<p>Stay educated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do boxing, martial arts, a great sport.</p>
<p>Stay in shape, but don&rsquo;t put your eggs all in the same basket.</p>
<p>And the parents sometime are angry when I&rsquo;m not angry, but I can see in their eyes, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like they kind of surprised.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not because I made it that I will tell the kid to follow the same path that</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I went to school to I&rsquo;ve studied, I dropped off school when I had my first world championship</p>
<p>fight against Matt Hughes.</p>
<p>But before that, I was in school.</p>
<p>Quite another, you know, another way to go if things would not have gone the same, the</p>
<p>way I wanted.</p>
<p>But the problem and I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s not only about boxing in MMA, I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>hockey, basketball, baseball, same, same thing.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the one on the hundred thousand that make it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m saying that make it when I&rsquo;m saying I make it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mean they can retire and have enough money for the rest of his life because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a sad story.</p>
<p>The only people only heard about the people that makes it.</p>
<p>But a lot of fighters, even a UFC champion in boxing, champion, even in football, basketball,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Big names when they retire, they have zero.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bankrupt, my friend.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very sad, sad story and a sad reality that most people are not aware of.</p>
<p>But having other paths in life actually can also increase the chance of you dominating</p>
<p>and like reaching the highest peak in your main thing.</p>
<p>I mean, Jimmy Pager, I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is, is a judo coach in in America.</p>
<p>He was he says that to all of his athletes is to make sure that you go.</p>
<p>He has a lot of, you know, Kayla Harrison, two time Olympic gold medalist.</p>
<p>He has a lot of Olympic medalists.</p>
<p>But basically, there&rsquo;s something about going to school, like having an forget school, any</p>
<p>other avenue in life that gives you the freedom to go all out in your main like that, you</p>
<p>know, you&rsquo;re doing it for the right reasons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not stuck.</p>
<p>It clears the mind to where you&rsquo;re free to be the best in the world as opposed to kind</p>
<p>of you have to.</p>
<p>I mean, different people are motivated by different things.</p>
<p>So sometimes some people like having their back to the wall and that&rsquo;s the only option</p>
<p>they have.</p>
<p>But most people, I think, excel when you have other options.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a distraction and I think it&rsquo;s important to have a distraction.</p>
<p>When you say that, I think about one of my coach, John Danaher.</p>
<p>He put his academic background experience into jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>And that for me, that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s the best teacher I ever had is incredible.</p>
<p>He start teaching me when I even couldn&rsquo;t speak much English at the time and I was able</p>
<p>to communicate and understand, you know, that&rsquo;s how good he is.</p>
<p>But I truly believe that most of the athletes, especially in sport like mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>train way too much.</p>
<p>If I could go back and talk to a young George, I would tell him, you do way too much volume.</p>
<p>You train way too hard, train smarter, it&rsquo;s more important.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes we underestimate the benefit of recuperation because I think we</p>
<p>assimilate the information that we learn during a training when we recuperate and not during</p>
<p>the training itself.</p>
<p>And this whole mentality of harder, heavier, you know, it&rsquo;s good for someone who&rsquo;s lazy.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re an elite athlete, most of the time, you know, like you&rsquo;re not always, but</p>
<p>most of the time is because you&rsquo;re not lazy.</p>
<p>And a lot of guys, sometimes they&rsquo;re elite athletes, champions, and you&rsquo;ll hear people</p>
<p>say, oh, I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s very gifted, but he doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But perhaps it&rsquo;s not really because perhaps it&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t understand, perhaps</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing the right thing and it&rsquo;s us who&rsquo;s working too much and too hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy I train with, he made me think about it.</p>
<p>His name is Mansour Barnaoui, he&rsquo;s going to be a future star, he&rsquo;s an incredible fighter.</p>
<p>He trained once a day.</p>
<p>And he asked me some time advice when he came to Montreal, he&rsquo;s from France.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear about him, he&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>And I saw him in the morning at TriStar and I said, okay, I&rsquo;ll see you perhaps later in</p>
<p>the other trainings.</p>
<p>He said, no, I only train once a day.</p>
<p>And he kind of waits for me to give him like, not an approval, but like to see how I react</p>
<p>or, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, it was kind of a strange feeling, but I told myself at that</p>
<p>point I kind of had an awakening and I told myself, man, maybe he&rsquo;s doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people would say, for example, oh, that&rsquo;s a lazy way of doing it, but perhaps</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best way to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that training once a day is the best way to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that everybody&rsquo;s different, but for him, it works beautifully.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t change anything, you know, like if I would be him because he&rsquo;s improving</p>
<p>like crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And ultimately the bigger picture there is to do something that everyone else says is</p>
<p>stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the fasting thing that a lot of people would say, a lot of nutritional experts</p>
<p>would say that that&rsquo;s a dumb way.</p>
<p>You know, if you want to be an MMA fighter, you should be eating like many times a day.</p>
<p>You should be starting every day with oatmeal.</p>
<p>You should be carving up constantly, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily true for everybody.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s actually now a few MMA fighters that are carnivore only.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I used to eat right before training and it didn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>However, now my first training that I do normally in average around noon, 11 a.m., I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eaten anything when I do my first training.</p>
<p>And it feels to me that I&rsquo;m much more clear in my mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more creative.</p>
<p>I feel better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>I just wish I would have known that before.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s fascinating, the role of the mind in all of this.</p>
<p>How important is it for your mind to be clear, to really think deeply?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a judoka American named Travis Stevens.</p>
<p>I remember he said something that the right kind of practice is when your mind is exhausted</p>
<p>at the end of it, that you were constantly thinking through things like your body shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be exhausted first, your mind should be exhausted first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>So people think about training hard, you know, a successful practice is where you walk away</p>
<p>just overwhelmed how much you had to think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating framing of a successful practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Travis Stevens was one of my main training partner when I got ready for my fight with</p>
<p>Nick Diaz and Carlos Candit.</p>
<p>He drove every Friday from, I believe, Boston.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a six hour drive.</p>
<p>Drive to the gym in Montreal, train with us an hour and a half, drive back.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got such an amazing discipline.</p>
<p>I was so happy for him when he won the medal at the Olympic game.</p>
<p>And what a well deserved, you know, accomplishment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>It paid off.</p>
<p>You know, I was so happy for him.</p>
<p>And every time we got to the gym, he was waiting for me in the kneeling position like a soldier.</p>
<p>I was like, my God, this guy is made of steel, you know.</p>
<p>And after training, I always offer him, I say, Travis, I know you like to train with</p>
<p>that because in Montreal, they have very good judo team, Nicholas Gill and all those guys.</p>
<p>And I say, if you want to stay, I&rsquo;ll get you at the hotel, you know, like anything</p>
<p>you want.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, no, I got to go back.</p>
<p>I have another training later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, not only did he train with us, he had to go back because he had another training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is insane.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s gone through a huge number of injuries.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s also an innovator because, I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult to say, but for American judo,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not many high level judoka.</p>
<p>So if you want to be the, like fight with the best in the world, you have to be alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lonely journey, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to be in Japan where everybody&rsquo;s a killer.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re alone at it, it&rsquo;s a difficult journey.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s funny we talked about kind of, there&rsquo;s some sports where a mistake is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t recover from a mistake.</p>
<p>I think judo oftentimes is one of those sports and added on top of that is the Olympics only</p>
<p>every four years.</p>
<p>And Travis&rsquo;s story, he&rsquo;s the reason I, when I saw him in 2008, cause I started martial</p>
<p>arts.</p>
<p>I switched from like wrestling and street fighting to doing jiu jitsu and judo.</p>
<p>And I just saw so much guts.</p>
<p>And the, in 2000, I might be messing up the years here, but in the next Olympics he fought</p>
<p>and he lost on just the referee call.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And just, he went to war and he just so much guts and just everything on the line and to</p>
<p>lose and then to still persevere through all the injuries, through all of that, through</p>
<p>incredibly difficult training sessions to go another four years and then compete and</p>
<p>then win a medal.</p>
<p>I mean, that guy&rsquo;s just, and like he clearly could have been very successful.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also an incredible jiu jitsu competitor.</p>
<p>So he could have switched to that, but he&rsquo;s stuck.</p>
<p>In a lot of sport, when you&rsquo;re in elite, like for example, in Canada, ice hockey is the</p>
<p>number one sport of the countries.</p>
<p>Kids when they&rsquo;re in elite, when they&rsquo;re young, they get chosen and they&rsquo;re kind of already</p>
<p>known as a superstar.</p>
<p>The school where they go and the program they follow, like I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>in the US and basketball, baseball, perhaps American football, because they already chosen.</p>
<p>So they grew up with that, that it&rsquo;s secure, that superstar stardom, so to speak.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s already sort of glamorous.</p>
<p>However, in MMA, there&rsquo;s no MMA, judo, wrestling, like in America, because it&rsquo;s not our national</p>
<p>sport, it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s not like, even when I first started, it was not really well</p>
<p>received by the media.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no glamor into it.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t know, it seems like it&rsquo;s another era now.</p>
<p>And I feel sometimes that some people do it for the wrong reason.</p>
<p>You know, some people do it because of the glamor, because of the money.</p>
<p>But even if you&rsquo;re an elite and very good, the glamor and the money won&rsquo;t come in the</p>
<p>beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very long grind before, you know, it starts to come in.</p>
<p>And you need to make those sacrifices.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a journey where you will be tested, you will be hurt repetitively.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to have to reach the down deep and come back up.</p>
<p>And then once you finally think you made it, you&rsquo;re going to go back in the down deep again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very exhausting and decaraging adventure sometimes.</p>
<p>But if you hold on to your dream and you believe in it, you know, and you have the stars aligned,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to make it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s only a few people that make it, you know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I feel sometimes that a lot of people in the new generation do it for</p>
<p>the wrong reason.</p>
<p>In my generation, because of sport, at first there were no rules.</p>
<p>I thought it was more pure.</p>
<p>The people that did it was really because of the passion.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t seek money, fame.</p>
<p>We did it because we wanted to be&hellip;</p>
<p>I did it because I wanted to be the man, you know.</p>
<p>I like to have the confidence that when I walk somewhere, you know, I have the confidence</p>
<p>that, you know, it&rsquo;s an illusion because nobody is faster than a bullet.</p>
<p>But I wanted to achieve it for myself.</p>
<p>Which today now, because I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s social media and all that, the world has changed.</p>
<p>The glamour, you know, I feel it&rsquo;s a different thing right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you get in it for the glamour or the money, you may not have the right amount</p>
<p>of fuel to persevere through all the ups and downs, for sure.</p>
<p>You know, when you talk about motivation of money and glamour, a guy comes to mind, and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many wrestlers, you know, but in Russia, there&rsquo;s a guy named Bovassiy</p>
<p>Satiev.</p>
<p>The Satiev brothers, one of the greatest freestyle wrestlers of all time, but he also has&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that he doesn&rsquo;t have many interviews.</p>
<p>One of my goals is to go out and talk to him in Russian, do an interview with him because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s exceptionally poetic and a deep thinker.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the kind of martial artist that you are in the way that it&rsquo;s not just about the different</p>
<p>battles you&rsquo;ve been through or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the philosophy behind the way he approaches life.</p>
<p>Now, he has spoken quite a bit about that the glamour, the fame, the money are all things</p>
<p>that get in the way of the purity of the experience, the art, that the way to achieve greatness</p>
<p>is to just lose yourself in the art of the actual combat, in his case, it&rsquo;s wrestling,</p>
<p>and then kind of not to worry and actively make sure that you block out anybody who,</p>
<p>you know, feeds you the narrative where you&rsquo;re supposed to be this famous person and all</p>
<p>those kinds of things that he basically says, let others write your story.</p>
<p>Make sure that you just focus on the art.</p>
<p>And another person from that side of the world is, of course, Khabib, so he represents that</p>
<p>side of the world.</p>
<p>And we were talking about walking away and most people not being able to walk away at</p>
<p>the top as you have, but also now Khabib has, it looks like, incredibly so.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you can comment about what your thoughts are about Khabib Nurmagomedov being</p>
<p>able to just walk away.</p>
<p>You know, we talk about the GOAT very often, Khabib is, you know, one of, isn&rsquo;t the argument</p>
<p>because he has the most dominant carrier of all martial art, the guy, you know, some guys</p>
<p>can be named the GOAT for different reasons, but Khabib for that reason, and he&rsquo;s undefeated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if he lost, he might have lost a round, but he dominates all his opponents.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous and such an incredible career that he had.</p>
<p>I love to watch him fight, he&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And when you talk about the art, when you say mixed martial art, the idea of a flawless</p>
<p>performance, for me, everybody often, when we say flawless performance, thinks about</p>
<p>a knockout, a brutal knockout.</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s to be able to showcase beautiful technique, like a beautiful takedown, beautiful</p>
<p>submission, like something beautiful that, you know, when you look at, for example, Wayne</p>
<p>Gretzky or Michael Jordan or like Stephen Curry, even if you don&rsquo;t know nothing about</p>
<p>basketball and you watch Michael Jordan, you&rsquo;ll be like, wow, that&rsquo;s beautiful what he just</p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>Like, we talk about fighting and trying to say the word beautiful in fighting for certain</p>
<p>people, it could sound kind of crazy, you know, but I&rsquo;m talking about the technique,</p>
<p>a beautiful technique, you know, for me, that&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>You know, when I was fighting, it&rsquo;s no need to have a brutal knockout because some people</p>
<p>are more gifted than others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying gifted, some people are better than others in certain phase of fighting.</p>
<p>But for me, it was that it was to showcase, to win, of course, but to showcase some beautiful</p>
<p>technique that you can watch it and be like, wow, that was incredible.</p>
<p>The timing, he did it.</p>
<p>And when I think about Khabib Nurmagomedov, I see all the detail of his work, especially</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s got his opponent against the fence, that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s his area of expertise</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s, to me, he&rsquo;s the best that ever did it in terms of that fighting style, that</p>
<p>particular expertise that he has, it&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>The flawless execution of that particular set of techniques.</p>
<p>And Conor McGregor had the accuracy.</p>
<p>The Spider Anderson Silva was like, was, I would say, the most flamboyant of all, you</p>
<p>know, like he was moving like the Matrix.</p>
<p>Jon Jones was incredible in terms of creativity, spinning elbows and that, and he faced incredible</p>
<p>adversity.</p>
<p>Dimitrius Johnson was so complete.</p>
<p>You could bring, like he was slamming a guy to an armbar.</p>
<p>It was just unbelievable.</p>
<p>Like, like he was like the complete fighter.</p>
<p>BJ Penn was like so flexible.</p>
<p>He did stuff with his body that like nobody could do his, the dexterity of his hips was</p>
<p>just unbelievable.</p>
<p>Dominic Cruz, to me, was incredible, his footwork, his distance control.</p>
<p>So when you talk about like the GOAT, Royce Gracie, another one, he did things that I</p>
<p>think for me is the number one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I gotta, I gotta, and sorry to interrupt, Royce is a fascinating one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think about him, but many people consider you, most people</p>
<p>consider you to be the number one greatest mixed martial arts fighter ever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating to remove you from that list and continue this discussion and asking</p>
<p>like, who do you think is the greatest fighter ever?</p>
<p>You listed some amazing ones, Royce.</p>
<p>You somehow skipped Fedor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very, as a Russian, I&rsquo;m very offended.</p>
<p>No, I was, I was going to, there&rsquo;s so many.</p>
<p>Fedor is one as well.</p>
<p>Fedor, I think in his prime was like, when you say, when you talk about a name, for example,</p>
<p>like we talk about him when he was in his prime.</p>
<p>Like when I talk, for example, about Anderson Silva, I&rsquo;m not talking about the Anderson</p>
<p>Silva who fought, who fought his last fight against Uriah Hall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the Anderson Silva who knocked out Victor Belfer.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>BJ Penn, same thing.</p>
<p>The problem is when fighters hang on for too long in the sport.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>They kind of make, make people forget how good they were.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very sad.</p>
<p>We talk about Fedor and just, just think about Stipe Miocic.</p>
<p>Miocic is probably the greatest heavyweight of all time.</p>
<p>With Fedor, I would really wonder who would have won this fight, the both guys in their</p>
<p>prime.</p>
<p>I tend to lean towards Fedor because my heart was with Fedor, but he could have gone the</p>
<p>other way.</p>
<p>But just because Miocic lose his last fight, now everybody&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, they forgot</p>
<p>about him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one fight.</p>
<p>You zig when you should zag, boom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why the thing is the mixed martial arts isn&rsquo;t just the performance, the strictly</p>
<p>who won and who lost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the stories we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, there&rsquo;s beautiful stories being weaved.</p>
<p>And that also is part of who is the greatest of all time is what were the battles, what</p>
<p>had to be overcome?</p>
<p>What was the flavor of the flawless performances?</p>
<p>You know, all of that plays into it and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Being able to walk away at the top is also part of that.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me about Khabib and that fight.</p>
<p>I want it to happen.</p>
<p>Khabib wanted to happen, but UFC did not want to happen between you and Khabib.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And we tried to make it like about three years ago when I retired, two, no, three, no, it</p>
<p>was after two years ago and it never came to fruition.</p>
<p>The UFC were clear.</p>
<p>They said they have other plan for Khabib and it makes sense for the business standpoint</p>
<p>because they want to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Now Khabib retired and like everybody else, after Justin Gaethje, I was doing the commentator</p>
<p>in French for the UFC and I had Butterfly, I thought he was going to call me out.</p>
<p>If there is one guy that I would have said, yes, it would be him, because for a fighter,</p>
<p>the most exciting things to do, it&rsquo;s often the scariest one.</p>
<p>And Khabib was, you know, the scariest macho.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But he was worth the risk because nobody has ever been able to solve them.</p>
<p>How would you solve the Khabib Nurmagomedov puzzle?</p>
<p>Well, Khabib is very good against the fence.</p>
<p>I would have to establish a game plan and everything, but I think what I would need</p>
<p>it to do is take the center of the octagon right away.</p>
<p>Use a lot of think and faith.</p>
<p>Keep the fight all the way, all the way out or all the way in.</p>
<p>And when I say all the way in is when you close the gap, use my proactive and reactive</p>
<p>takedown and perhaps my superior explosive to put him down.</p>
<p>I like to use those proactive and reactive techniques because for me, I feel it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>economical.</p>
<p>Khabib is a much better chain wrestler than me.</p>
<p>Chain wrestler is when you got that guy to the fence, it&rsquo;s pure wrestling.</p>
<p>What makes my takedown very efficient?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my karate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my wrestling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very good at timing my opponent and getting in with my explosivity.</p>
<p>So if you watch my takedown, it does not demand often, it does not demand a lot of work.</p>
<p>When I use the, I call it proactive takedown.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s coming to punch me and I react, I mean, proactive is when I&rsquo;m faking it.</p>
<p>So I instigate the takedown by a fake, then I take him down.</p>
<p>And reactive is when I&rsquo;m baiting him to throw something, then I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a counter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But all my takedowns&hellip;</p>
<p>In the center of the octagon.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My takedowns are more in the center of the octagon.</p>
<p>Like for example, another guy that does it well is Gleason Thibault that did it well</p>
<p>in his best days.</p>
<p>Khabib has more a style of chain wrestling, I would say like Kamaru Usman, so to speak,</p>
<p>kind of guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different style.</p>
<p>You cannot compare both styles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of takedown I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>And if I would have fight Khabib, that&rsquo;s one of the strategy I would have adopted.</p>
<p>I would not have been afraid because everybody that I fought, I was able to put them down</p>
<p>and I have the pedigree to prove it in my fight resume.</p>
<p>So you would have perhaps seen him on his back and I would have perhaps be on my back</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>So it would have been a very interesting fight.</p>
<p>How hard do you think he is to takedown?</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people speak about his wrestling being just&hellip;</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the wrestling because&hellip;</p>
<p>It has to do with the karate.</p>
<p>If I got that timing and I got my both hands around his knees, he&rsquo;s going down the other</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>Everybody goes down.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, he goes down.</p>
<p>And I had a lot of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would have adopted.</p>
<p>I would not have been afraid of his wrestling.</p>
<p>I would have be the instigator.</p>
<p>I would have forced the fight forward.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I would have approached that fight, which I believe most of his opponent</p>
<p>were afraid of his wrestling because they didn&rsquo;t have the tools that I have to put him</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>I would not have forced the wrestling.</p>
<p>I would have&hellip;</p>
<p>In the clinch, I would have tried to disengage.</p>
<p>I have many ways to disengage a clinch.</p>
<p>I would have wanted to force the fight in a fighting distance, like in a shoot box distance,</p>
<p>not in a wrestling distance.</p>
<p>Is it possible this fight still happens?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re young, you look great in a suit.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of problems now.</p>
<p>And the thing is, now I made peace with it.</p>
<p>I no longer don&rsquo;t want to fight and I don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>UFC was not interested and I&rsquo;m bound by contract with the UFC and by exclusivity.</p>
<p>Some people says to me, oh, how about if a wealthy Russian guy come with the money?</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m going to be in court with UFC.</p>
<p>And also, I&rsquo;m older now and when I go home and I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t want to do this, you</p>
<p>know?</p>
<p>But you were always like this.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t want to do this.</p>
<p>But like, for example, I was training with Freddie Roach a few days ago and I&rsquo;m hitting</p>
<p>pads, you know?</p>
<p>And Freddie is looking at me and he&rsquo;s like, hey, you have the hitch back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</p>
<p>If Dana White would walk in the room, in the gym at that precise moment with the UFC contract,</p>
<p>I would sign it in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>But when I go home, I&rsquo;m like, hell no, my belly is full, I&rsquo;m healthy, I&rsquo;m wealthy.</p>
<p>Why would I want to fight for?</p>
<p>I made peace with it.</p>
<p>But the minute I go back in the gym, because I still get it inside me when I train with</p>
<p>the young guys, I still get it.</p>
<p>And a lot of guys think, hey, tell me the truth, you&rsquo;re preparing a comeback because</p>
<p>I still get it.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a little bit older, but I got more knowledge, I can compensate.</p>
<p>I become a different animal because, you know, it changed you.</p>
<p>But then after you go home and you&rsquo;re like, man, no way I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to explain, you need to be a fighter to understand that it&rsquo;s very, very</p>
<p>hard to explain.</p>
<p>Well, from your perspective, I think Khabib is one of the rare, one of the few fascinating</p>
<p>scientific puzzles yet to be solved.</p>
<p>So from that aspect, as a martial artist, it&rsquo;s just a fascinating journey to try to</p>
<p>solve that puzzle.</p>
<p>There is a thing too, like we say, oh, who&rsquo;s the best fighter, people, Lex, they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like I am this, I realized that later in my life and I&rsquo;m sure a lot of young guy will</p>
<p>say, oh, I say, Pierre, it&rsquo;s not, don&rsquo;t speak for me, but I&rsquo;m telling you right now what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to say, you will realize it later.</p>
<p>When I was young, I think you can proclaim yourself the more, the badass man on the planet,</p>
<p>you know, like nobody can beat you at, it&rsquo;s an illusion, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sad thing about, for example, DC, Daniel Cormier does probably one of the greatest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the greatest of all time, you said Neotish, but like, it&rsquo;s almost because of</p>
<p>that little matchup with John Jones, it&rsquo;s difficult for people to conceive of him as</p>
<p>the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about matchup, it&rsquo;s all about timing, and also you make a fight, you make both guys</p>
<p>fight 10 times, the result might be different, like every time, you know, I mean, maybe he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna win eight out of 10, but that night, he&rsquo;s gonna lose, why?</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t know, the universe made it like that, you know, maybe he got sick, maybe</p>
<p>he had the emotional issues, he didn&rsquo;t sleep well, and it makes him lose focus and he got</p>
<p>caught, you don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t know, but that&rsquo;s the thing, people ask me, would you have done</p>
<p>it with Khabib, what would happen?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe out of 10 times, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe as a fighter, I hope I would have</p>
<p>won more than him, he thinks the opposite is only one way to find out, but that night,</p>
<p>if there is a fight, the guy that&rsquo;s gonna win doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s the best fighter, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mean that he&rsquo;s the one that fought the best the night of the fight, same thing in basketball</p>
<p>or hockey, the team that wins the game, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the best team, it&rsquo;s the team</p>
<p>that played the best the night of the game, and fighting is no different, so being the</p>
<p>baddest man on the planet, it&rsquo;s an illusion.</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s the tragic thing about it, is on any one night, anything can happen and</p>
<p>then that tells a story for all of human history, it&rsquo;s sad to think about, but that&rsquo;s what makes</p>
<p>it beautiful, that there&rsquo;s so much at stake, like entire lives, all the dreams you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>growing up, all the hard work, all of it is decided in a single night, even though that</p>
<p>means nothing in terms of who&rsquo;s actually better, I mean that&rsquo;s the beauty, that&rsquo;s why people</p>
<p>love the Olympics especially, because it happens so rarely, and dreams are broken, or like</p>
<p>triumph is achieved by the unlikely hero, all like right there, I mean that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>love it, right, that&rsquo;s why we love it.</p>
<p>If we wouldn&rsquo;t know always the result before, it would be boring, that&rsquo;s why we do it, you</p>
<p>know, watch the odds, like sometimes I like to watch the odds before a fight, you know,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s things, I believe in causality, everybody believes different things, but I</p>
<p>believe everything is because there&rsquo;s a cause to everything, that&rsquo;s personally what I believe,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that I have like free will, I think I have the illusion of free will,</p>
<p>but I believe there&rsquo;s a cause for everything, and if I&rsquo;m doing something because of something,</p>
<p>because of a cause, by definition, there&rsquo;s no free will in a way, if there&rsquo;s a cause,</p>
<p>by definition, there&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel by the way, like the idea that if we just look outside of even</p>
<p>just human psychology and fighting and so on, if we look at like physics, if everything</p>
<p>is predetermined, if all of these little molecules interacting, it&rsquo;s all already, like your story</p>
<p>is already written.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends, it&rsquo;s written, but I wouldn&rsquo;t need to know all the data and it&rsquo;s impossible,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s kind of weird, I gotta say, but to me, I don&rsquo;t see any argument to counter</p>
<p>that idea, maybe I&rsquo;m ignorant, but I haven&rsquo;t seen nobody and everything that I&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>so far, there&rsquo;s nothing that counter that idea, because in a mechanical world, if your</p>
<p>car broke, or we don&rsquo;t say, oh, the car decided to broke, or a tree is fall, there&rsquo;s reason</p>
<p>why the tree is fall, we don&rsquo;t say the tree is decide to fall, right?</p>
<p>So because us human being, I think it&rsquo;s our ego, we decide, and I&rsquo;m no different than</p>
<p>anybody when I make a decision, I decided to do this, I choose to do this, but I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>that there is causes that make me do certain things, and by definition, I think if there</p>
<p>is a cause, there is no free will, by definition, right?</p>
<p>Yes, but the thing is, just like you said, we understand so little about human intelligence,</p>
<p>the human mind, and especially consciousness, that this giant mystery, this darkness, that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand how it feels like to be something, to be a conscious being, that because</p>
<p>of that, we&rsquo;re not able to really even reason about free will, or not, because there might</p>
<p>be some magic that comes from consciousness, the consciousness might be the thing that</p>
<p>makes us different from a car that breaks down.</p>
<p>There might be something totally fascinating, totally undiscovered yet, that will make us</p>
<p>realize that free will is actually real, and is somehow fundamental to the human experience.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, sometimes I think we forget when we talk about free will and physics and it</p>
<p>all seeming to be predetermined, we forget how little we actually understand about the</p>
<p>world, and I think in that mystery, there could be totally new ideas that are yet to</p>
<p>be discovered, and will make us realize that it&rsquo;s not just an illusion, it is something</p>
<p>that is like at the core of how the universe works.</p>
<p>Some people believe that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the forces of physics, like consciousness permeates everything, it&rsquo;s in everything.</p>
<p>Like this table is conscious, but it&rsquo;s not as conscious as us, and we&rsquo;re this little</p>
<p>peak of consciousness, and if that&rsquo;s true, and if we get to understand that, maybe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something, there&rsquo;s an extra bonus we get in terms of free will once you become one of</p>
<p>those entities that are super conscious.</p>
<p>So I tend to be sort of humbled by the mystery of it.</p>
<p>Do you believe one day with the technology that keep improving, we will make robot that</p>
<p>will be able to be somehow conscious?</p>
<p>Absolutely, that&rsquo;s been my dream, that&rsquo;s been, I hope to do just that.</p>
<p>First of all, I believe that all people are capable and want to be good to each other,</p>
<p>and I think love is a really powerful thing that connects us and can create better and</p>
<p>better worlds, sort of like create better and better societies that improve both the</p>
<p>technology, the quality of life, and just the basics of human experience.</p>
<p>And I think creating AI systems that are conscious, that are human like, can enable us to be better</p>
<p>to each other.</p>
<p>Like they can, it&rsquo;s almost like adding more and more kindness to the world through the</p>
<p>systems we interact with will inspire us to be better and better to each other.</p>
<p>In terms of them being conscious, I think that is an absolute requirement that entities</p>
<p>we interact with communicate some element of consciousness to us, like that&rsquo;s how we</p>
<p>connect to each other.</p>
<p>The reason we, you and I connect is that we believe that each of us are conscious.</p>
<p>And to me, what consciousness means is the ability to hurt, the ability to suffer, to</p>
<p>struggle in this world, because just like you said, without the struggle, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the love, you don&rsquo;t have the pleasure, and ultimately consciousness is an entity&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to struggle, to suffer, and from that arises the pleasure.</p>
<p>And us together being able to appreciate the highs and experience together the lows, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how we form the deep connections.</p>
<p>I personally think we can create that in robots, and I personally believe it&rsquo;s a lot easier</p>
<p>than we think.</p>
<p>Does it make you afraid sometimes about the fact that one day AI, like artificial intelligence</p>
<p>could hurt us?</p>
<p>Because of Hollywood, of course, the movies we watch, but it seems like when I hear sometimes</p>
<p>Elon Musk talking, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Elon talks about with AI, we&rsquo;re summoning the demon.</p>
<p>He is very concerned, and I talked to him about it quite a bit, he&rsquo;s very concerned</p>
<p>about all the different ways AI could hurt us humans.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that there&rsquo;s a lot more ways in which AI can make our lives better</p>
<p>and can make life awesome for humans.</p>
<p>I think humans are the ones that can do a lot of evil things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m less worried about AI, I&rsquo;m more worried about humans.</p>
<p>If I look at what humans have done on the course of history, for example, in regards</p>
<p>to the planet to the scale of the universe, I think what I&rsquo;m afraid is that we have more</p>
<p>of a destructive force than a beneficial force.</p>
<p>So if AI take that in consideration in order to protect us against ourselves, it could</p>
<p>hurt us in a way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you understand, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>Does it makes you afraid sometimes, not because of AI, but because of what humans are doing</p>
<p>that AI could do to us to prevent us of hurting ourselves, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, definitely it can bring out the worst in human nature and provide tools</p>
<p>for evil people to do evil things at a larger scale.</p>
<p>But I just think it depends what you think human beings are.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that as we get more intelligent, we start to see the value, the evolutionary</p>
<p>value and the value in terms of happiness of being good to each other.</p>
<p>And I think AI, if you look at AI as an optimization problem of how to create a civilization that</p>
<p>works well and expands throughout the universe, I think love is much more effective.</p>
<p>So AI will help us maximize that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be always spikes throughout, as it has been through human history,</p>
<p>where charismatic leaders will do evil onto the world in the name of good.</p>
<p>You have the Stalin and the Hitlers and all of that.</p>
<p>But ultimately over time, I think technology will give the good people power and the evil</p>
<p>people less power.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of ways that that won&rsquo;t be the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways for it to go wrong and Elon talks about them, but I honestly think</p>
<p>in terms of intelligent AI, that&rsquo;s going to bring more love to the world.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m concerned about is dumb AI.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion between China and the United States recently on autonomous</p>
<p>weapons system.</p>
<p>This is something people don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re afraid to talk about, but there&rsquo;s now a race where</p>
<p>the United States has officially said that they&rsquo;re not against adding AI to its weapon</p>
<p>systems.</p>
<p>So now the US military is adding automation, adding intelligence to its drones, to anything</p>
<p>that can create damage.</p>
<p>And so of course, and they did this so in response to China doing that.</p>
<p>So you can imagine this is Terminator.</p>
<p>You think about Terminators and intelligent systems, they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re pretty dumb.</p>
<p>The point is they&rsquo;re efficient at doing what they do.</p>
<p>And in the space of war, efficient at doing what you do means killing.</p>
<p>So that I&rsquo;m really afraid of, but those are dumb AI.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t your loving, deep, fulfilling relationships.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like efficiently being able to fly, to plan the trajectory of dropping bombs,</p>
<p>of missiles, of how to do counter attacks, of how to maximize the destruction of a particular</p>
<p>facility instead of individuals.</p>
<p>And then that can just escalate.</p>
<p>And as opposed to the cold war with the Soviet Union, this could be a hot war.</p>
<p>And then the consequences, once you allow, it&rsquo;s kind of terrifying because currently</p>
<p>the drones are operated by humans.</p>
<p>So you have say, you have information about, intelligence gives you information about a</p>
<p>particular terrorist located in this area.</p>
<p>And then you use drones to maybe the automation there is to help you figure out what is the</p>
<p>best trajectory to strike at that location.</p>
<p>So you still have a human that pulls the trigger at the end and dropping the bomb.</p>
<p>Now automation and AI and autonomous weapons systems might be where you say, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bad guy over here.</p>
<p>You figure out how to get rid of the bad guy.</p>
<p>So then of course the systems will be very good at finding the right trajectory and so</p>
<p>on, but there&rsquo;s bugs that can happen.</p>
<p>Unexpected bugs that the system might figure out that there is this bad guy might actually</p>
<p>be in these other five locations.</p>
<p>So might make sense to cover the entire area, right?</p>
<p>And so you might drop bombs on the entire area and then that&rsquo;s just okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to lead to a lot of destruction at the scale of a city, but then you can immediately</p>
<p>take that to nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>If you add automation to responding to counterattacks to nuclear weapons, somebody, you might get</p>
<p>information that somebody is planning a nuclear attack on the United States and the AI system</p>
<p>will immediately respond and you know, it can respond at a scale of launching nuclear</p>
<p>weapons itself.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s all of these possibilities that don&rsquo;t require much intelligence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exceptionally concerning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like you, I do not believe there is babies that are born bad.</p>
<p>I think people do bad things because of their experience.</p>
<p>However, if I look through my experience and from what I can see is some very often, man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>of power wants more power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes me afraid with, you know?</p>
<p>Absolutely, listen, I&rsquo;ve come from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stalin is arguably one of the most powerful humans in history.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not talked often enough about by the evils he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Hitler gets all the attention, but Stalin has done arguably much more evil than Hitler.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this is human nature.</p>
<p>It wants power.</p>
<p>We see that with institutions, we see that with governments and nations.</p>
<p>I think you see this with the internet, people are really hungry for the distribution of</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>Like you see that people are very much distrustful of centralized places of power, of institutions</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So I think successful organizations, successful companies, successful governments will be</p>
<p>run by people who distribute the power.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t trust myself with power at all.</p>
<p>And I think you have to build into the system that no one person can have power and that</p>
<p>you distribute it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you have in the financial sector, you have cryptocurrency right now with Bitcoin</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>People are exploring, how can we avoid the central bank to have the control?</p>
<p>How do you put the power in the hands of people, thousands of people, millions of people?</p>
<p>And same way with military, with any kind of, with technology, I think the future looks</p>
<p>very distributed.</p>
<p>What do you think about militarizing space?</p>
<p>The space force, I don&rsquo;t think about it often because right now I&rsquo;m filled with excitement</p>
<p>about space exploration, which is the positive aspect.</p>
<p>So Elon, I was born in an era where it was exciting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but for me it&rsquo;s exciting to look up to the stars and dream about us</p>
<p>humans colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets, expanding out to the galaxy, into the universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>So the possibilities there are endless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, because also the resources are endless.</p>
<p>And so I think we get into trouble with militarization, with wars when the resources are very constrained.</p>
<p>So I think for a while we&rsquo;re not going to be fighting, the only wars we&rsquo;ll be fighting</p>
<p>in space are the ones that kind of help us.</p>
<p>Another nation to compete, who goes to the moon first, I guess.</p>
<p>Those kinds of things are maybe for satellites and all those kinds of communication and maybe</p>
<p>in assistance for cyber warfare, which is also very dangerous.</p>
<p>But in terms of the wars out in space, I think everything out in space will be positive and</p>
<p>inspiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard, but all good things are hard, I think.</p>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;ve been talking to a bunch of people about extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited by, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>When I look out to the stars, it&rsquo;s exciting to me.</p>
<p>I know I think you&rsquo;ve spoken about it being scary, but to me it&rsquo;s exciting that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>intelligent creatures out there far beyond perhaps the intelligence of our own that are</p>
<p>just too far away to explore yet, but we might one day come in contact with them.</p>
<p>So that to me is the ultimate motivator is to meet other intelligence life forms out</p>
<p>there and connect with them.</p>
<p>Have you ever meet Jacques Vall√©e?</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;ve been in communication.</p>
<p>I want to, I hope to talk to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an amazing&hellip;</p>
<p>French, yeah.</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s many theories about, you know, if there&rsquo;s alien, we don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>But some people think it&rsquo;s from another star systems and Jacques Vall√©e has like to make</p>
<p>a long story short, he has a different theory, thinks it&rsquo;s perhaps beings that could be living</p>
<p>in a different dimension than us.</p>
<p>And the reason why he says that is when he makes an experiment, when there is a sightings</p>
<p>very often of a UFO, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m the UFO that you have three guys, they are looking</p>
<p>at the UFO very often, one experiment that you can do, and sometimes that is the case,</p>
<p>you ask your two friends to walk on the side and there&rsquo;s a point that it&rsquo;s like a corridor,</p>
<p>you see the UFO and then you stop seeing it like a corridor.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why he&rsquo;s saying that it&rsquo;s perhaps dimension.</p>
<p>And I found that fascinating, you know?</p>
<p>This is what, you know, to the discussion of consciousness and all that, it feels like</p>
<p>we might be just experiencing a very particular slice of this universe, we might not be understanding</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s at the higher dimensions or, yeah, I mean, higher dimensions in whatever form</p>
<p>that means, you know, there&rsquo;s all these physical theories now that describe a world with dimensions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much higher than the four dimensions of the three dimension of space and the one</p>
<p>dimension of time.</p>
<p>So whatever the hell is going on in those other dimensions, it could be something, unfortunately,</p>
<p>this is the sad part, it might be something we can&rsquo;t even comprehend with our human brains,</p>
<p>that the limitations are just, I mean, we&rsquo;re just descendants of apes, so like it might</p>
<p>not be possible to even understand.</p>
<p>Is there alien?</p>
<p>Is there another dimension?</p>
<p>Are they human from the future?</p>
<p>Is there perhaps Chinese or another, you know what I mean, a group of people that are working</p>
<p>with technology far behind?</p>
<p>But you know what, Lex, I had the chance to meet, you know, because of the sport I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>I met a lot of people in military and politics sometimes that I ask them every time.</p>
<p>I met one this week and I asked him, I say, is it true about the UFOs there?</p>
<p>And he says to me, he&rsquo;s like, even before I asked him, I say, sorry, I have to ask you</p>
<p>a question.</p>
<p>I was in Los Angeles and I said, sorry, I have to ask you a question.</p>
<p>He said, oh, you want to ask me about UFOs right away, you do.</p>
<p>And I say, yes.</p>
<p>He saw it in your eyes.</p>
<p>He said, yeah, there is things that flies that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t tell me, he doesn&rsquo;t know it, they don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s alien or whatever,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s things apparently that are detected.</p>
<p>And I know you met Fravor, you know, like Fravor is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It makes me sad that we live in a different era now that it used to be a subject that</p>
<p>was ridicules and now it&rsquo;s so cool that it&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;m very excited to live in to that</p>
<p>era, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really exciting, but still the governments are kind of behind the times on</p>
<p>that aspect is they&rsquo;re not transparent and they don&rsquo;t communicate well.</p>
<p>You know, it saddens me to think the possibility that, that, you know, like the US government</p>
<p>might be in possession of something that they don&rsquo;t tell the world about because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just scared is because they don&rsquo;t know what the hell it is and they don&rsquo;t want the Chinese</p>
<p>to gain the technology or all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Do you think the president of the United States, for example, because the president comes and</p>
<p>go every, right, four or eight years, do you think he would know all the secret or it would</p>
<p>be a guy like, for example, Vladimir Putin would know much of, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the president even know, like even knows all the secret.</p>
<p>The US president.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so because he goes, they go back and forth, you know, every four years,</p>
<p>you know, they have the terms, right?</p>
<p>So I, you know, I wasn&rsquo;t sure before, but I think I could trust the previous United</p>
<p>States president of Donald Trump that if he knew, he would probably tweet about it.</p>
<p>So I think from the, you know, I&rsquo;ve worked with DARPA, I worked with DOD at a clearance</p>
<p>and I think from the perspective, if you, if you see the world as fundamentally a dangerous</p>
<p>world where secrets are important to have from a military perspective, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very unsafe to tell the president of the United States that you have this kind of technology.</p>
<p>So if you think of the world in that way, I hate that that&rsquo;s how that world is viewed</p>
<p>because ultimately I think what&rsquo;s more powerful than the military secrets, and I hope that</p>
<p>actually is what will happen in the 21st century, is what&rsquo;s more powerful is inspire people.</p>
<p>Inspire the young Elon Musk&rsquo;s of the world to create cool new things.</p>
<p>If we have technology that we&rsquo;ve have come, have encountered that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that should only be inspiration to develop that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as military, as a military threat, as a secret to hold on to.</p>
<p>I think secrets, I hope we more and more let go of the idea that there are secrets that</p>
<p>give us advantage, you know, like in the tech sector, people are more and more releasing</p>
<p>the software and making it open source.</p>
<p>Like secrets don&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>They share the knowledge, right?</p>
<p>Share the knowledge.</p>
<p>Like being afraid to share the knowledge, I think, I hope is an old idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, yeah.</p>
<p>When you make it, things more compartmentalize, you know?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing is the bureaucracy of government is like people only know their</p>
<p>own little thing and they don&rsquo;t spread the information.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t travel well.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of just inefficiencies that are, it makes me sad.</p>
<p>It makes me sad because the science, the engineering that happens in governments, like Lockheed</p>
<p>Martin developing the different airplanes that they use for military applications is</p>
<p>some of the most incredible engineering ever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s secret because they&rsquo;re afraid to share it with the Russians and the Chinese</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>But on that topic, I do think somebody like Vladimir Putin probably knows some stuff.</p>
<p>My God.</p>
<p>I would love to know what he knows.</p>
<p>But then again, you never know because even he is, you know, people think of him as an</p>
<p>exceptionally powerful person, but he&rsquo;s also just managing a bunch of tribes.</p>
<p>His power is very limited.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to hold together a bunch of greedy, power hungry, mad men.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s trying to establish a balance.</p>
<p>He might not know everything.</p>
<p>So I hope this changes because I think there&rsquo;s nothing more exciting about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if there is a human that knows.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like this idea that there is some civilization, alien civilization that that land on the White</p>
<p>House and say, hi, I come to meet the president.</p>
<p>And like, why would they do that?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of absurd.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Well, I do think that actually, I mean, that&rsquo;s one possibility, right, is LART, you know,</p>
<p>if an alien civilization really wanted to contact us, I think everybody would know.</p>
<p>So I think what we&rsquo;re, if there&rsquo;s any kind of interaction between humans and aliens,</p>
<p>I think most likely what we&rsquo;re interacting with is a crappy like probe drone thing that</p>
<p>kind of just like, like, it&rsquo;s like this, this dumb thing, you know, we&rsquo;re not interacting</p>
<p>with the aliens.</p>
<p>I think just like, just like for us, I think humans aren&rsquo;t when we venture out into space.</p>
<p>The first thing that&rsquo;s going to meet aliens is our robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not us humans because we keep sending robots out.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to like, they&rsquo;re going to make decisions about humans by looking at</p>
<p>the robots.</p>
<p>I say the famous grays, the grays, maybe they are robots.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s all BS too, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what that interaction actually would look like if aliens really</p>
<p>wanted to reach out, really communicate.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re able to actually communicate with them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the sad things.</p>
<p>We may not be able to, that we might, the aliens might already be here and we might</p>
<p>just not even know, know how to see them or know how to communicate with them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much misinformation and sometimes there is peoples that are very credible that,</p>
<p>that made crazy claims, you know, like, you don&rsquo;t know what to believe, you know, like,</p>
<p>like Paul Aylor, the minister of defense of Canada said like some, that there is many</p>
<p>alien rays that ever, that&rsquo;s what he said, research it and that scientists from, I think</p>
<p>Israel recently have said something about Trump, he was keeping secret or Medvedev,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Russia, Medvedev have been caught in a, like during a break in between interviews</p>
<p>to talks about like, oh, it&rsquo;s like men in black, so to speak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t look like he was joking, but I don&rsquo;t know if he was saying the truth.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can check on YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it went, it went viral.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things like that sometimes I&rsquo;m like, or, or Bob Lazar, I&rsquo;m like, imagine</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s true, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Imagine if we&rsquo;re like a fish in the water, we live in our own world and sometimes there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fisherman that grabbed the fish, take him out of the water and threw it back in the</p>
<p>water and the fish goes back to the other fish and say, Hey, there&rsquo;s someone that, that</p>
<p>take me out of the water.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ve seen things that I did not like.</p>
<p>Imagine if it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like we like, yeah.</p>
<p>And one other thing, like I wanted to ask you because you were consciousness, how about</p>
<p>dreams?</p>
<p>What is a dream?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I, I, I more and more, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention to this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s become more acceptable in the scientific community to do large scale</p>
<p>studies of psychedelics, for example, and there&rsquo;s a lot of connection between psychedelics</p>
<p>and dreams.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very similar states.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot our mind does when it detaches itself from reality that it can</p>
<p>just explore a lot of different ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that dreams is you&rsquo;re traveling somewhere and the same thing with psychedelics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re traveling somewhere in a different, not traveling to physical space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the other dimensions that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re traveling some other through some other dimension to meet some other creature.</p>
<p>People talk with DMT that they meet some elves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done, I I&rsquo;d like to, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a safe legal way to do it, but</p>
<p>they all talk about meeting elves and creatures like entities and like, who are they?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what is this?</p>
<p>Is it because they&rsquo;re high or it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re actually meeting something and maybe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no difference.</p>
<p>I mean that who knows exactly and that&rsquo;s takes us right back to us not being able to really</p>
<p>understand how our mind works.</p>
<p>You know, I work in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that we understand so little about intelligence, some basic things about intelligence</p>
<p>just at the, at the very sort of basic first principles level.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand what it means to, to reason, to think, to assimilate pieces of knowledge</p>
<p>together from the, from the basics to the complex.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand how the human mind does it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand how the human mind is able to take incredible waterfall of information</p>
<p>and filter cleanly into just like clean.</p>
<p>You only see the things that are important and are able to stitch them together and be</p>
<p>able to reason about the world.</p>
<p>And at the same time have moments of like genius of creativity.</p>
<p>Like what is that?</p>
<p>That also, you know, people, writers talk about that, that they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>almost like communicating with a muse, like where do ideas come from?</p>
<p>This is the Joe Rogan philosophy.</p>
<p>But I do know that past civilization where a lot of them were based on shamanism.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sad is if someone drink alcohol and when he&rsquo;s drunk, he&rsquo;s going to commit</p>
<p>like create like, like murders or something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to blame the person.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to say that&rsquo;s his fault.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the fault of alcohol.</p>
<p>However, if someone does psychedelic or any things that is illegal and you do something</p>
<p>crazy, now we&rsquo;re going to put the fault on psychedelic.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And perhaps the person itself is the reason why, you know, he&rsquo;s been doing these things,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating how like society, you know, like in Canada, they just legalize</p>
<p>marijuana.</p>
<p>Oh yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Marijuana is legal.</p>
<p>But before that, before they did it, like if you talk, for example, to my dad, my dad</p>
<p>is against it, like, because the whole mentality is like, it&rsquo;s drug, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>But drinking a glass, you know, drinking a beer, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I mean, what is, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>What is good?</p>
<p>What is bad?</p>
<p>And I guess eating chocolate could be bad as well for your health or, I mean, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to the extreme now, but what is good?</p>
<p>What is bad?</p>
<p>If you use it for recreation, you use it for an experience, to learn about yourself, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a, the line is very tiny, you know, there&rsquo;s some countries that drugs are all legals,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the stats, but I would be interesting to know if they have more crimes</p>
<p>there than other countries where it&rsquo;s more strict.</p>
<p>I would be interesting to know about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to me, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, we humans kind of just come up with arbitrary lines of what&rsquo;s good, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bad that applies with drugs, that applies with anything, that applies with animals,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>We talked about carnivore diet.</p>
<p>Maybe the time we live in now will be remembered for the cruelty to animals, for example.</p>
<p>And I believe this, the 21st century will be remembered for our cruelty to robots.</p>
<p>That eventually there&rsquo;ll be a civil rights movement for robots where the ones who choose</p>
<p>to be conscious, the ones who have consciousness will say, we deserve rights too.</p>
<p>We deserve to be treated with respect too.</p>
<p>How about the people we put in jail?</p>
<p>People put in jail.</p>
<p>I mean, I think in the future we&rsquo;ll look back and we&rsquo;ll think of ourselves being stupid,</p>
<p>you know, to put people in jail instead of, you know, like trying to fix the problem at</p>
<p>the base, you know?</p>
<p>Of course now we&rsquo;re, or I guess it&rsquo;s our ignorance that made it in a way that we cannot sometimes</p>
<p>understand what makes sometime a psychopath, a psychopath or a murderer, a murderer, but</p>
<p>you know, if we can pinpoint the problem and take care of it before, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Or made it in a way that we can reestablish that person in the society.</p>
<p>You know, who knows, you know, what was the future&rsquo;s hold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We live in an interesting time.</p>
<p>You mentioned your father.</p>
<p>What have you learned from your dad?</p>
<p>You mentioned he was an important part of your childhood.</p>
<p>My dad is amazing.</p>
<p>I grew up, we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean if I&rsquo;m born in a nice</p>
<p>country that always nice thing happened, you know?</p>
<p>My dad for me is a big role model because I see him through to my life facing a lot</p>
<p>of adversity.</p>
<p>You know, he stopped drinking when I was a teenager, he was an alcoholic and I seen him</p>
<p>struggle through that, you know, and it was very, very hard and I&rsquo;ve seen him work like</p>
<p>crazy hours, like come leave in the morning, come home at night, burned out because of</p>
<p>work through almost all his life to the point that it became a slave of the system.</p>
<p>It became an habit and a normal way of living and it made me realize that I have learned</p>
<p>a lot through my father.</p>
<p>He taught me perseverance, hard work, you know, when you face adversity, you know, to</p>
<p>never give up until you achieve it, but also he taught me a lesson that in a way that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be like him, even if he is happy, it&rsquo;s because I realized I don&rsquo;t think he knows</p>
<p>anything else.</p>
<p>Like he works through all his life and I don&rsquo;t want to live to work.</p>
<p>I want to work for, you know what I mean, I want to decide when I work, you know, I</p>
<p>feel like like he lived to work instead of working for a living.</p>
<p>And perhaps it&rsquo;s because he did not have choice, he was the older of his family, they were</p>
<p>nine kids, his dad, my grandfather died when he was young, so he had to become the father</p>
<p>of the family and work to put money on the table.</p>
<p>So perhaps that&rsquo;s what made him that way and it became like an habit for him.</p>
<p>My dad taught me when I was at school, I was bullied at school, he&rsquo;s the first one who</p>
<p>initiate me to martial art.</p>
<p>He taught me karate, my dad was a black belt in Kyokushin karate as well.</p>
<p>But because he was working too much, he didn&rsquo;t have time to teach me and I needed self defense</p>
<p>in order to defend myself.</p>
<p>I have a winning, a great career in mixed martial art, but in the school yard, my record</p>
<p>is not very good.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a kid and you&rsquo;re about seven, eight years old and you&rsquo;re facing bullied</p>
<p>bullies that are two to three years older than yourself, it&rsquo;s not the same thing than</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re 25 and the guy is 28.</p>
<p>So there was a big discrepancy in terms of maturity.</p>
<p>So my dad taught me, introduced me to karate, then he didn&rsquo;t have time to teach me.</p>
<p>Then he put me in a school with a teacher, it was Jean Couture.</p>
<p>And I grew up with a lot of anger and there were two persons I was afraid growing up.</p>
<p>It was my dad, my dad was very severe, very strict with me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad he was because I could have become very bad.</p>
<p>I could have become chosen on a different path.</p>
<p>People see me as a nice guy and I am a nice guy, I try to be a good role model, but I</p>
<p>could easily have turned towards a wrong path.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s darkness somewhere in there.</p>
<p>Yes, there are a lot.</p>
<p>And a lot of my friends have chosen that path and unfortunately they are not with me today.</p>
<p>Even if I&rsquo;m from Canada and Canada seems like the nicest country in the world, like I said,</p>
<p>even if you live in a nice country, it&rsquo;s not always a nice thing, it depends on the situation.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what my dad taught me.</p>
<p>And he gave me that because I&rsquo;m very good at learning by observing people and by observing</p>
<p>him I see the struggle he had with alcoholism and what he did, the pain sometimes that he</p>
<p>inflicted to us, to my family.</p>
<p>But how he turned, he did a 180 degree and I really admire that.</p>
<p>And I know it was very, very hard for him and he did it and for me that&rsquo;s a great role</p>
<p>model for me.</p>
<p>So with your dad being an engine of basically hard work and you finding a balance of being</p>
<p>able to work your ass off, but also to be able to enjoy a piece of chocolate, what is</p>
<p>a perfect day in the life of George St. Pierre look like?</p>
<p>So like if you were to go through a day that&rsquo;s very productive, but also one that makes you</p>
<p>sit back and enjoy and say that was a good day, what&rsquo;s that look like?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>When do you wake up?</p>
<p>What do you eat?</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>It changed over the years.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I have a good day.</p>
<p>It was like a good training session or, you know, achieving good thing in my training,</p>
<p>you know, and that&rsquo;s why I was very good at it because when I, I was obsessed, you know,</p>
<p>I think to be good at something, you need to become obsessed.</p>
<p>And to me, performing in my training was everything, you know, like when I had a bad training session,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell my training partner, I was acting like a, like because of my ego, I didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, I didn&rsquo;t tell nobody, I was like, Hey, then I go in the locker room and like,</p>
<p>man, then I&rsquo;m playing the, the, the, the training in my mind and I&rsquo;m saying, okay, I should</p>
<p>have done this, should have done that, and it haunt me.</p>
<p>It haunt me, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a training and it haunt me until the next training session when I can redeem myself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it is.</p>
<p>When we used to train in, in all together, back in the day in Canada, we had David Loiseau,</p>
<p>we had Patrick C√¥t√©, we had Dennis Kang, Steve Vignot, Jonathan Goulet, there was all</p>
<p>like the best guy in Canada that were training with each other before we were training in</p>
<p>different gyms.</p>
<p>But once a week, I made it in a way that I contact everybody that we all join force and</p>
<p>we exchange ideas and we train with each other.</p>
<p>So a friendly, I would say friendly competition.</p>
<p>It was not malicious, but it was hard training, you know, like not, our goal was to improve,</p>
<p>you know, but it wasn&rsquo;t very competitive.</p>
<p>And when that day you used to get out of the training session with a bad performance for</p>
<p>me, it used to haunt me until the following week when I could give it back and perform</p>
<p>better with the guy that I had the most trouble with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it was.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you get better, you know, but, but it was not a training where we were trying</p>
<p>to do malicious thing to one another.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You need to be playful, but playful, but competitive.</p>
<p>That when I had a good training session, because the sparring was on a Friday, I had the best</p>
<p>weekend in the world.</p>
<p>I was going out with my friend, drinking and partying and have fun.</p>
<p>That that was, that was my, my, my, my ideal day back in the day.</p>
<p>Today has changed.</p>
<p>You know, my, my, my, my life has changed.</p>
<p>You know, like I, I am not the same person I used to be when I got, went on my knees</p>
<p>and beg the UFC for title shot.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I am a, I&rsquo;m wealthy, I&rsquo;m healthy.</p>
<p>Most importantly, that&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>And as, and I&rsquo;m going to tell you the truth, as good as my career was, man, my private</p>
<p>life, man, is a million times better, man.</p>
<p>I, and, and people ask me sometimes they always wonder, they, they try to ask me and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>normal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of people is curious and the reporter and in the sport of mixed martial art, we</p>
<p>say we play basketball, we play soccer, but you don&rsquo;t play fighting.</p>
<p>So when you expose your private life, we seen that happen in the fight with sometime Conor</p>
<p>McGregor and Khabib, your competitor knows that he cannot get to you.</p>
<p>So what he will do, he will try to get to someone that you love.</p>
<p>So may I never expose my, my private life.</p>
<p>I never post Instagram of my family or my stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason why, because I&rsquo;m in a, I&rsquo;m in a business of fighting and people know</p>
<p>that they cannot get to me.</p>
<p>And I believe because I was bullied when I was young, I didn&rsquo;t realize that when I was</p>
<p>young, but it helps me deal with the mental warfare that I need, that I had to face later</p>
<p>on in my life and mixed martial art, because it&rsquo;s a very egotistic sport.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of, a lot and a lot of intimidation.</p>
<p>And I was used to, I&rsquo;ve been used to this thing when I was young.</p>
<p>So it does not get to me, however, the good way to get to me, go, go, go, go try to get</p>
<p>to someone I love now, man, I&rsquo;m going to go crazy.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m aware of that.</p>
<p>So in order to protect myself, I always, because I&rsquo;m aware I&rsquo;m a public person.</p>
<p>So I try to always keep my surrounding like in the private.</p>
<p>You know, one of the ways that like your friend and mine, Joe Rogan has been an inspiration</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s got like an incredible family and he, for the most part, it started to change</p>
<p>recently.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting, but for the most part, throughout his life, he kept</p>
<p>it pretty secret.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t talk about it in his, he&rsquo;s a comedian, comedians talk about everything.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t really talk about it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>It like preserves the magic of the silence of the private life.</p>
<p>And I think it can affect the development of the kid.</p>
<p>If the kid grow up being, oh, he&rsquo;s the son of that guy instead of being his own person.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>Like my parents are older, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But it taught me a big lesson.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m with my friend at the dinner or anything, I talk with person, always share a thing.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m talking, I&rsquo;m aware of the audience where I&rsquo;m in front.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, but oftentimes those people are just incredible.</p>
<p>It kind of makes me sad that, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that love you, right?</p>
<p>And there are a lot of really incredible people and you&rsquo;ll never get to really know their</p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, for me, it makes me sad.</p>
<p>You see them like at airports and stuff.</p>
<p>People will tell me they listen to this podcast or something like that.</p>
<p>And I could tell they&rsquo;re incredible people.</p>
<p>It makes me it&rsquo;s like a little goodbye of a possible friend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It makes me sad.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It makes me it&rsquo;s lonely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like celebrity is a lonely thing.</p>
<p>So the higher the celebrity, the more lonely you become in some kind of way.</p>
<p>But of course, you have that little gem of a private life where you can personally, I</p>
<p>believe every relationship I like, I don&rsquo;t like to use this term, but it&rsquo;s always a give</p>
<p>and take relationship, you know, like you can gain something and the person like it</p>
<p>could be something like not materialist materialistic, like something always a good, confident like</p>
<p>someone that can give me good advice or.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a word I would say, like extensional, like if a pilot as a copilot is the copilot</p>
<p>is extent as an extensional relationship with him, you know, so he knows if he gets sick</p>
<p>or faint, he&rsquo;s there to make sure, you know, he&rsquo;s there to help.</p>
<p>And I think in every relation it&rsquo;s about compatibility, but it&rsquo;s about extensionality, right?</p>
<p>In a way that if that person is extensional and sometimes we talk about about love, you</p>
<p>know, like sometimes I think is it is it a BS word or not?</p>
<p>Because I myself sometimes look at I look at myself in the mirror and when I do stupid</p>
<p>thing, sometimes I love myself a lot and sometimes I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m angry at myself, I&rsquo;ve done stupid thing.</p>
<p>So that means sometimes you could love could be fluctuating.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>How about in relationships?</p>
<p>Sometimes people, they say, oh, they love each other, but then when they divorce, they</p>
<p>go, oh, I want the house and the dog and the kids stay with me.</p>
<p>And you know what I mean?</p>
<p>If you love, by definition, if you really love someone and let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re an old man</p>
<p>and you love a woman and she decides to leave you for a younger man, if you really love</p>
<p>her, you&rsquo;re going to help her pack and leave.</p>
<p>But in our society, sometimes we want to hone something.</p>
<p>To me, love includes the missing somebody, the losing somebody, the anger at somebody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the passion, feelings towards somebody.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all love.</p>
<p>I, you know, it&rsquo;s all part of the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ups and downs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sad thing is when the feelings towards a person, the ups and downs go away, the forgetting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opposite of love.</p>
<p>So the opposite of love isn&rsquo;t hate.</p>
<p>To me, the opposite of love is forgetting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a much bigger, that&rsquo;s the depth of human connection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I see love.</p>
<p>Sometimes I try to stay positive and I&rsquo;ve been asked how I try to, because I have the</p>
<p>image of someone who&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>But I go through my own demon as well sometimes.</p>
<p>However, when we talk about love, when I was young, you know, like, I didn&rsquo;t love who I</p>
<p>was at first.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I love, I learned to kind of love myself.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t, when I was going to bullying, I was, I believe I was bullied because I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>love myself because I project a very bad image of what I think of myself.</p>
<p>I was a kid that lacked a lot of confidence.</p>
<p>I was looking down when I was walking.</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulder.</p>
<p>When someone was talking to me, I was avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>So I was a very easy target for bullies.</p>
<p>And I think bullies are like a predatory animal in nature.</p>
<p>They will hunt the easier prey.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go, the lion don&rsquo;t go for the alpha bull.</p>
<p>They go for the one who&rsquo;s old or who&rsquo;s sick, the weakest one.</p>
<p>And bullies are the same in society, I believe.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t like to be bullied, of course, but I didn&rsquo;t like the person that I was.</p>
<p>But I found out through martial art, the respect and my coach was extraordinary to me.</p>
<p>He taught me discipline and self strength.</p>
<p>And I found out that I needed to, in order to love myself, I needed to change myself.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn&rsquo;t like what I saw.</p>
<p>So I decided to become like someone that I would love.</p>
<p>So I tried to look people straight up and try to showcase a more confident image that</p>
<p>I had.</p>
<p>And it was hard in the beginning because I didn&rsquo;t really believe in it, but I fake it</p>
<p>until kind of I make it.</p>
<p>So when I was walking at school, more and more I was learning how to become more confident</p>
<p>and I was like taking charge.</p>
<p>The teacher was asking questions, at first I was never answering, I was like this, waiting</p>
<p>always to be the last.</p>
<p>Then I was, hey, I know what the answer, this is the answer.</p>
<p>I got out of my comfort zone, so to speak.</p>
<p>And I wish I would tell you that I got out of bullying because a Hollywood story, I used</p>
<p>martial art to beat up all the bullies.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not how it happened to me.</p>
<p>It happened because I changed myself from the inside out.</p>
<p>And I learned how to, because I didn&rsquo;t love myself in the beginning, I learned how to</p>
<p>become like someone that I love.</p>
<p>And even now, like I&rsquo;m by no mean perfect, I do a lot of stupid things, but I learn as</p>
<p>a person.</p>
<p>And even I do as something stupid, I&rsquo;m like, shoot, I did something stupid.</p>
<p>At least I can apologize to the person if I realize, and then I know that I&rsquo;m not the</p>
<p>person I was in the past, I&rsquo;m the person that I am right now.</p>
<p>So I can learn and become that image of the person that I love.</p>
<p>So in a way, the reason I&rsquo;m trying to be positive and I&rsquo;m able to stay positive sometime in</p>
<p>life is because I&rsquo;m always trying to be like that person that I love.</p>
<p>And I think if you don&rsquo;t look yourself in the mirror and don&rsquo;t love yourself or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see any positive future for yourself, how can you change your environment if you cannot</p>
<p>change yourself?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You will never be happy if you&rsquo;re not happy when you look at yourself in the mirror.</p>
<p>So change yourself first, then change, you know, it&rsquo;s not the environment that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to change for yourself.</p>
<p>You have to go from the inside out, you know.</p>
<p>This I learned through martial art.</p>
<p>I had a coach who was incredible, used to drill these ideas in my head and give me confidence,</p>
<p>you know, like this, telling me all these beautiful things about myself and how he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dead now, unfortunately, peace to him.</p>
<p>But he was incredible, incredible.</p>
<p>He was very, very strict.</p>
<p>I was afraid of him.</p>
<p>I was afraid of my dad and afraid of him.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t teach nowadays like he used to teach me because he would be probably in jail,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad he did it because for the time being, that&rsquo;s what I needed.</p>
<p>And I would never have had the career I had in mixed martial art without this because</p>
<p>I would never have got out of my comfort zone, would have been impossible.</p>
<p>And in order to improve in life, you need to get out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, very hard to do.</p>
<p>And strive to be the person that you can love, that&rsquo;s beautifully put, George.</p>
<p>If you were to give advice to a young person today about life, what would you tell him?</p>
<p>If he takes life with the same mentality that I do, if he has the same taste of things that</p>
<p>I have, I would tell him, you know, for sport, for life in general, I would say, if you will</p>
<p>have a dream, you know, like make everything in your power and work very hard, you know,</p>
<p>never take no for an answer and go through hell in order to achieve it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t work hard only, but work smart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I think the problems with a lot of people, they work hard, they can work hard,</p>
<p>they burden themselves, they don&rsquo;t work smart.</p>
<p>Whether it is in science and business, they make bad choices or they&rsquo;re badly informed</p>
<p>in sport.</p>
<p>How many guys I&rsquo;ve seen ruin their career in the gym, they spar so hard, they ruin themselves</p>
<p>in the gyms, they leave their career in the gyms.</p>
<p>What I would say to, for example, because my field of expertise, it&rsquo;s in sport of mixed</p>
<p>martial art, I would say to a young kid, make your training playful.</p>
<p>You know, when you get ready for competition, you need to train to recreate those elements</p>
<p>that makes you go outside of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>But in everyday life in general, make your training playful.</p>
<p>What makes it like a hardcore competition about who&rsquo;s winning, who&rsquo;s losing, make it</p>
<p>playful.</p>
<p>So it will increase your, because you will not be afraid of getting hurt or losing.</p>
<p>You will be tempted to try more things and it will make you become more creative.</p>
<p>You know, that brings up another question about learning.</p>
<p>So you value knowledge and you&rsquo;re exceptional at basically being very good at learning and</p>
<p>figuring stuff out, new things or going deeper on the things you already know.</p>
<p>So what advice would you have for how to learn effectively?</p>
<p>How you say work smart, how do you figure this game out?</p>
<p>I believe the best way to learn is learning from other people&rsquo;s mistake.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not perfect and I&rsquo;ve learned from my mistakes as well.</p>
<p>And sometimes it took me a few mistakes to learn the same thing.</p>
<p>But especially in the sport of mixed martial art, because we&rsquo;re talking about the failure</p>
<p>could have very serious outcome on someone&rsquo;s life and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s crucial to trying to learn from other people&rsquo;s mistakes.</p>
<p>Do you study others?</p>
<p>Every fight I&rsquo;m studying my opponent and I&rsquo;ve studied myself as well to know how my strength</p>
<p>mix versus my opponent weaknesses and how can I make the fight go in a way that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking my opponent outside of his comfort zone.</p>
<p>Very often people are good at studying their opponent, but they&rsquo;re not good at looking</p>
<p>at themselves in the mirror and knowing what they should do in order to maximize their</p>
<p>odds of success, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I always thought for me, it was important to not be the best at one thing,</p>
<p>but be very good at everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I always seek advice, advices from the best in every discipline.</p>
<p>I wrestle with the best wrestler I could be with, I box with the best boxers, I practice</p>
<p>karate with the best karate fighters.</p>
<p>Same thing in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>I train Jiu Jitsu with the best Jiu Jitsu guys.</p>
<p>However, when I mix everything and mix martial art, because I&rsquo;m very competent in every area.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m fighting someone, I&rsquo;m very good at identifying where is the less competent.</p>
<p>And I know for a fact that because I&rsquo;m competent everywhere, if I can bring the fight where</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s outside of his comfort zone, it increased my odds of winning.</p>
<p>There is no certainty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about odds, I believe, because there is always X factor that you do not control.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see you actually, because you&rsquo;ve been a student of movement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been exploring all kinds of, I mean, gymnastics, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something reminiscent to, like Conor McGregor is one other martial artist that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of explored movement, been a scholar of movement.</p>
<p>At least from my perspective, it&rsquo;s very sort of Bruce Lee like, it&rsquo;s almost making a study</p>
<p>of the human body and all the possible things you can do.</p>
<p>Is there a philosophy behind that, that you have?</p>
<p>You talk about Bruce Lee, man, you said it best.</p>
<p>He changes my life too.</p>
<p>He was ahead of his time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>A lot of people talk to me and ask me, hey, is Bruce Lee would have been able to fight</p>
<p>in UFC?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think he was a martial artist.</p>
<p>He could have defended himself, but to say that he could have competed amongst the elite</p>
<p>of the elite fighter, perhaps in his time, but for sure, if you put him in UFC right</p>
<p>now, the sport has improved incredibly since then.</p>
<p>But in terms of philosophy, Bruce, he was amazing.</p>
<p>One thing that just to prove that he was ahead of his time, he was talking about using your</p>
<p>longest weapon against your opponent nearest point.</p>
<p>And we see that kick, it got popularized by John Jones, the sidekick to the tie, his longest</p>
<p>weapon against your nearest point in boxing is the jab.</p>
<p>But in MMA, when you can use it, all your weapon, that&rsquo;s the kick to the tie.</p>
<p>And there is, I felt there is like kind of three dimension in martial art.</p>
<p>There is the philosopher, like Bruce Lee.</p>
<p>There is the choreography, the choreographed people, like for example, you see in movies</p>
<p>that stun people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incredible.</p>
<p>Or the one that does like forms and karate, like jumping, spin kick, back kick, like acrobatic</p>
<p>stuff, mixed martial art.</p>
<p>They are unbelievable.</p>
<p>And there is also the one that competes in fighting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>I personally specialize in.</p>
<p>Well, you also do the philosophy.</p>
<p>I do a little bit of philosophy, but that&rsquo;s the consequence of the fighting.</p>
<p>I guess we are all like we all practice the three dimension because martial art is I would</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s whether you want it or not, you have to touch these three dimensions.</p>
<p>But you will specialize in one.</p>
<p>I specialize through my life in fighting like the real thing in terms of fighting, competition.</p>
<p>Of course, if you do martial art, you&rsquo;ll be able to defend yourself because it&rsquo;s a self</p>
<p>defense.</p>
<p>However, you might not be able to fight as an elite and the most prestigious organization.</p>
<p>And you might not be able to perform the stunt that, for example, the stuntman I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>in the series I was playing in the Falcon and Winter Soldier, these guys are incredible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like real life superhero.</p>
<p>Things they do, to me, like it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And also Bruce Lee, the philosophy.</p>
<p>How many hours he took like thinking about these stuff, you know, I&rsquo;m sure he did not</p>
<p>just came out of nowhere, you know, like he was thinking that&rsquo;s mean he slept on this.</p>
<p>How many hours?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just unbelievable.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like water, my friend.</p>
<p>How many times has he thought about water going to bed before he said that?</p>
<p>Well, let me ask a very important fundamental question about martial arts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both wearing a suit and tie.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan thinks that wearing a tie is a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p>Is it a clip on or is it an actual tie?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an actual tie, I really want it.</p>
<p>So do you agree or disagree with Joe Rogan that wearing a tie is a martial arts significant</p>
<p>disadvantage in terms of combat, in a combat scenario?</p>
<p>In a fight, I think it would be a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I work as a security bouncer in nightclubs and event when I was 18 years old.</p>
<p>And sometime I had to work in certain event that I was in suit and tie.</p>
<p>I never had to use my force to take someone out when I was in suit and tie.</p>
<p>But if I would have had to before going to the table to physically take the guy out,</p>
<p>I would have removed my tie and I would have removed my vest for sure.</p>
<p>And I would have called back up for sure.</p>
<p>And I would have probably used the element of surprise to be first on the guy.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a bar, same thing, you call back up first and you make sure you ask the</p>
<p>waitress before to clean the table before you go.</p>
<p>And when you go, you have to use the element of surprise.</p>
<p>Because fighting, fighting in mixed martial arts and fighting in the street, it&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>different things.</p>
<p>And yes, I&rsquo;m a mixed martial arts competitor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done all my life.</p>
<p>But I had a lot of street fight in my life, a lot when I was in&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge difference.</p>
<p>There is guys that if I would have a choice, you know, to fight, like, for example, certain</p>
<p>guys in UFC in a street fight and fight like other guys that are not in UFC, I would maybe</p>
<p>sometimes pick guys that are not in UFC, not necessarily.</p>
<p>Because in a street fight, there&rsquo;s no referee that says go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the element of surprise.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re a nice guy, you&rsquo;re not the aggressor.</p>
<p>You always have the element of surprise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it taught me.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because if the person will not come punch you without warning, it needs to, it needs</p>
<p>to trigger some&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that needs to be triggered before.</p>
<p>So if someone comes because he&rsquo;s looking for trouble, there is a sign that he&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>for trouble.</p>
<p>So I was just talking with Bas Rutten this weekend about it.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>Every martial art comes from&hellip;</p>
<p>Like some martial art are from Exclusivik for competition, like sport karate, like certain</p>
<p>martial art.</p>
<p>But traditional martial art are for the street, are for self defense.</p>
<p>And I start my background in Kyokushinkarate, so it&rsquo;s for&hellip;</p>
<p>And I did Japanese Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>So my background, before I even start training for mixed martial art, my background is in</p>
<p>self defense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important to understand that in a street fight, the element of surprise</p>
<p>is everything.</p>
<p>And there are no rules.</p>
<p>You can go for the eyes, the necks, the&hellip;</p>
<p>It surprises everything.</p>
<p>Total, total ballgame, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You have the chair, the beard, there&rsquo;s so much more thing going on.</p>
<p>So the idea of&hellip;</p>
<p>Because you are a UFC fighter, you think you&rsquo;re invincible.</p>
<p>This is BS.</p>
<p>Anybody can come.</p>
<p>Like if a big guy who punch very hard, most people don&rsquo;t know how to punch.</p>
<p>By the way, they don&rsquo;t know how to make a fist and throw it in a forward direction.</p>
<p>But if someone knows how to do it, I don&rsquo;t care who you are.</p>
<p>If you could be Francis and Genu, someone come behind your head and bang.</p>
<p>Or let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s an argument and you get surprised by a punch.</p>
<p>You can be drop and lose a fight, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The element of surprise is everything.</p>
<p>So you were saying remove all the sources of the elements of surprise, clear the bar,</p>
<p>remove the tie.</p>
<p>I still disagree with you about the tie.</p>
<p>Just for your information, if someone comes looking for trouble and you see me do this</p>
<p>and going sideways a little bit, that&rsquo;s my position that I&rsquo;m thinking maybe something</p>
<p>will happen and I&rsquo;m about to punch you or to do something to take care of this situation.</p>
<p>To flip the table on you then, wearing a tie is communicating the nice guy image.</p>
<p>So it actually gives you the freedom for more elements of surprise by wearing the tie.</p>
<p>If you take it off, you&rsquo;re limiting your options because nobody&rsquo;s going to expect the guy in</p>
<p>the tie to do anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer that sometimes it&rsquo;s not only materialism, it&rsquo;s what you project.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I had troubles in a bar and I was able to deflect, the guy was looking for trouble</p>
<p>talking to me and I was able to deflect his whole aggressivity by saying like, hey, man,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a nice shirt.</p>
<p>Where did you get it?</p>
<p>Like saying like something or stupid like this, then it kind of breaks the momentum</p>
<p>and he, you know, but the guy was looking for trouble.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fight you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fight you, but I&rsquo;m not going to wait until you pull, you make the first</p>
<p>move because the minute you touch me, you push me or you touch me, you declare war and</p>
<p>the war is unleashed, my friend, and I&rsquo;m taking you out of order with the necessary force,</p>
<p>of course.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing with martial art.</p>
<p>If you use the necessary force to take care of the problem, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But if you, you know, you take advantage of it, that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s not all right because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weapon.</p>
<p>So if someone comes up to me, that&rsquo;s my position and now I&rsquo;m assessing the situation, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they teach in self defense here.</p>
<p>Never put your hands down.</p>
<p>Always hand there because I&rsquo;m down or boom, like what this is, this is very important</p>
<p>and you never, you always your center line on the side like this.</p>
<p>If someone knows martial art, he will recognize that pattern.</p>
<p>But if you go like, if someone talked to you and you go like this, that&rsquo;s mean you&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>the guy that you want to fight.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to, oh yeah, you know, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the position because your hands are</p>
<p>here, you know, whatever you can do, you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Well, also your ear tells a story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not everybody that knows that, however, it&rsquo;s some people might think that it&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>mom grabbed me by the ear and pulled me because I didn&rsquo;t listen to her, you know.</p>
<p>A real fight in the street and a fight in mixed martial art is a different ball game.</p>
<p>What do you think is the best martial art to prepare you for street fighting?</p>
<p>You know, people often kind of have this discussion of Jiu Jitsu, maybe boxing, maybe wrestling.</p>
<p>Do you think, when you talk about a young person studying martial arts to prepare themselves?</p>
<p>For a street fight, it&rsquo;s often much different than a mixed martial art fight.</p>
<p>And I know there is a lot of BS in the world of martial art, like self defense stuff that</p>
<p>like, but I believe self defense is very important in a way to understand the situation, to understand</p>
<p>those situations that might occur, how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Because not necessarily that we talk about the technicality, we talk about the tacticality,</p>
<p>the tactics, you know, like when I&rsquo;m talking to you about the element of surprise is important.</p>
<p>This is not technique, technique is a punch or techniques that I physically will use to</p>
<p>enable my opponent, my aggressor.</p>
<p>Tactic is the tactic I&rsquo;m telling you about is in a street fight, if someone is looking</p>
<p>for trouble and I feel the heat rising as the conversation goes, that&rsquo;s the position</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take and I have to be first.</p>
<p>I cannot let him go first.</p>
<p>So I have to strike first or do something.</p>
<p>This is the first thing that generally I have to agree on.</p>
<p>After that, of course, there is the knowledge.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a professional fighter, you have a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Once the fight is started, the war is declared.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s everything goes.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, the person that will intervene, that will have the first blow or</p>
<p>the first, you know, the first punch will have a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like doing a hundred meter race and having a head start, you know, and that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prepare for with any martial arts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m a smart guy, I know how to fight.</p>
<p>If a guy like an heavyweight champion comes to me or like, like, like, you know, I know,</p>
<p>I know what to do to disable him, like boom or here or the neck, you know, like, and if</p>
<p>you blind him, what is he going to do?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So, so or a bottle, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So the element of surprise is it&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s always, always good to be the nice guy and not looking for trouble.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re not looking for trouble, you have the head start, you have the option</p>
<p>of having a head start.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is being a nice guy is the best form of self defense, maybe a</p>
<p>little humor.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you know, I have learned that I&rsquo;ve learned that when I was a kid, I was about maybe</p>
<p>seven or six, six years old.</p>
<p>We used to play in Montreal, there&rsquo;s a lot of snow, we used to play king of the mountain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first combat lesson that I&rsquo;ve learned in my life.</p>
<p>And I managed somehow, it was a lot of kids, I managed to get on the top of the mountain</p>
<p>and another guy came in, come in on top of the mountain and he was angry that before</p>
<p>I was there before him.</p>
<p>When you play king of the mountain, it was a mountain of snow.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t strike each other, we just wrestle and push.</p>
<p>And I managed to be first.</p>
<p>And when he came, he says to me, say, OK, you want to, you want to fight?</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what he means, like I want to fight, I want to wrestle.</p>
<p>I say, yes.</p>
<p>He punched me right in the face.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>And then I and then I fall on the bottom of the mountain.</p>
<p>Then when I fall down, I remember that vision in my life because it&rsquo;s I will remember that</p>
<p>for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to stand up and I see the blood coming out of my nose, I see that the snow</p>
<p>is red because my nose is bleeding.</p>
<p>Now I remember the element of surprises, everything.</p>
<p>My first street fight, I lost it.</p>
<p>I got I didn&rsquo;t get knocked out, but I got dropped on the bottom of the snow mountain.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, you got me because I wasn&rsquo;t expecting my hand, I was not expecting a punch.</p>
<p>So from there, when I felt the heat of an injury, an argument or something was not right,</p>
<p>I always stroke first.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t win all my fight because sometimes there were more than one guys on me, you know.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s important to not be the aggressor.</p>
<p>So you have the element of surprise and always use that in your favor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so brilliant.</p>
<p>Let me go from the very practical to the most impractically huge question about the meaning</p>
<p>of life.</p>
<p>You said that when great depths of unrelenting sorrow are punctuated by great peaks of joy</p>
<p>and liberation, the result is delicious.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the meaning of this whole journey that we&rsquo;re on this life?</p>
<p>What makes life delicious?</p>
<p>To me, you know, satisfaction is the M for me.</p>
<p>Like I always, if I&rsquo;m satisfied, that means I have nothing to live for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking only about my career, I&rsquo;m talking about my life.</p>
<p>What do you want in your life?</p>
<p>You want kids, you want a family, you want to be champion.</p>
<p>What do you want in your life?</p>
<p>You have like a long term goal, short term goal.</p>
<p>In mixed martial arts, I achieve what I needed to achieve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m satisfied.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer the same George St. Pierre than when I was begging for a title shot on my</p>
<p>knees.</p>
<p>I move on from it.</p>
<p>Now I had a chance to go into movies.</p>
<p>Now that same insane drive that I had to be the champion in the world, now I put it into</p>
<p>acting.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m having a lot of acting class now and luckily for me, the timing was amazing.</p>
<p>I got cast for the Falcon and the Winter Soldier that is on Disney Plus channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge, huge project to be part of for me because it&rsquo;s like you play basketball,</p>
<p>you have a chance to go for the NBA right away.</p>
<p>I was very lucky.</p>
<p>The timing was just too perfect.</p>
<p>And so you need to constantly challenging yourself and having goals to achieve, you</p>
<p>know, like that.</p>
<p>Keep your brain activated, like keep working.</p>
<p>And the proof of that is that you see sometimes some old people, like when they retire, very</p>
<p>often sometime you see that they got sick and they die or because they it&rsquo;s either because</p>
<p>sometimes we think we we certainly may benefit, we do something good for them by making that</p>
<p>work and giving them a break.</p>
<p>So in our mind, we&rsquo;re like, oh, he&rsquo;s going to be able to relax.</p>
<p>But in their mind, it&rsquo;s not good because they&rsquo;re not busy.</p>
<p>They have nothing to live for.</p>
<p>Like my dad is used to work all the time and he has always something to do.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s retired now.</p>
<p>I myself now call him by force to find him some job.</p>
<p>Hey, dad, can you come in my house?</p>
<p>Have this thing to repair?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to do it.</p>
<p>So it gives him it gives him a reason not to live on because he has other things to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>But but what I mean is also in life, I think you always don&rsquo;t be afraid to aim high.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t be afraid to fix your objective very high and never be able to reach it.</p>
<p>Be afraid of reaching your goals, essentially.</p>
<p>I mean, you always have to keep moving it out.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an interesting question because you&rsquo;ve been acting in some really</p>
<p>exciting things.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a dramatic role where it&rsquo;s basically, you know, you go full Robert</p>
<p>De Niro in Taxi Driver?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be a full length feature film with George St. Pierre?</p>
<p>I liken there is level to this thing.</p>
<p>Am I aware that I have to restart as a white belt white belt?</p>
<p>And for some people, it could be discouraging.</p>
<p>But for me, man, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I freaking love it.</p>
<p>I embrace it because everybody told me like I would never be able to do it and it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But the and also the outcome of a failure in the sport of mixed martial art is much</p>
<p>more serious than the outcome of a failure for a movie, for example, for for if you think</p>
<p>when you should zag in a fight, you get knocked out if you zig when you should zag and on</p>
<p>set.</p>
<p>Oh, cut.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do it again.</p>
<p>And I know that I will be most likely be to chosen for action martial art roles because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my background.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this new trend in Hollywood now when they want someone to play an Italian guy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to choose a real Italian person.</p>
<p>When they want someone to play a Russian guy, they&rsquo;re going to choose someone who has a</p>
<p>real Russian background.</p>
<p>Now they want a real martial art fighter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done fighting all my life.</p>
<p>I just need to improve my acting skill.</p>
<p>But when I train in acting, I get myself out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not playing a role of a martial art guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing like romance, comedy, drama.</p>
<p>So when I go on set and playing the role of a badass martial art guy, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>So like in training for a fight, I always make my preparation harder than the actual</p>
<p>task.</p>
<p>I would love to see where I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen the wrestler with Mickey Rourke.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Those types of films.</p>
<p>I would love to I would love to you do something like that.</p>
<p>If not now, then in 10, 20 years, I could see that that would be amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s levels to the game, right?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s gradual.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m aware that I don&rsquo;t want to take something on my shoulder that I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be able to deliver.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fighter wants to go for a title shot right away.</p>
<p>It could very well break him, you know, and I don&rsquo;t want to do that because I know I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done some gigs in the past, but I was not focusing on it because I was focusing on competing</p>
<p>as a martial art martial artist in competition in MMA.</p>
<p>But now I take it very seriously.</p>
<p>So I cannot do the same mistake again because I&rsquo;ve done some stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it for the money and it was good.</p>
<p>It was fun to be beat up by Jacque Van Damme, Steven Seagal and everything.</p>
<p>But my acting was not on point, you know, at that time.</p>
<p>So if I ever every time I&rsquo;m going to come back from now on, on screen, you need to be</p>
<p>sharp because you cannot mess it up.</p>
<p>If you mess it up, it&rsquo;s like a loss on your record.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not taken seriously.</p>
<p>So so that&rsquo;s how I see it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very fun because I had a chance to talk to a lot of guys on top of all the class</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m having.</p>
<p>Like a few days ago, I was with Danny Trujo.</p>
<p>And I always seek the advice of actors when I when I see some of them that because I really</p>
<p>admire how they do, you know, how they project their emotion.</p>
<p>And I asked him, Danny Trujo, I said, I said to him, he&rsquo;s an amazing guy, by the way.</p>
<p>Very nice guy.</p>
<p>And I asked him, I say, how how do you do to be?</p>
<p>Because you scared the hell out of me.</p>
<p>How do you do to be so scary?</p>
<p>Like what is your trick?</p>
<p>And he tells me, he&rsquo;s like, George, if you&rsquo;re threatening, if you&rsquo;re threatening someone</p>
<p>and you scream at him, I&rsquo;m going to kill you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as scary if you&rsquo;re smiling and you say, I&rsquo;m going to kill you like and he says</p>
<p>also to me that another advice he gave me is like when you say this, think about you</p>
<p>killing him for real, that how you hate him and how you&rsquo;re going to kill him.</p>
<p>So the camera will take the emotion out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try physically to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the mistake I used to do before.</p>
<p>I used to physically show that I&rsquo;m strong and angry and to be mean.</p>
<p>So these are just an example of tricks that I learned sometimes when I met an actor.</p>
<p>I always try to learn from everybody that I met in my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult journey because then you have to go to some dark places as a person</p>
<p>because you really have to imagine imagine some dark things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, actually.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the actors, they have sometimes problems because of that, because now I understand</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s like if you work on your bicep, your bicep will grow.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it is the stress that you put on it that will make it grow.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Emotions are, I believe, are the same way.</p>
<p>If you used to dig inside of you down deep to to to to make your negative emotion, depressive</p>
<p>emotion comes out, if something bad in your life happened, you will fall into those emotion</p>
<p>much more rapidly than someone who does not that every day.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because it will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a muscle memory.</p>
<p>Like if you program yourself to react a certain way, you will reach that point very often.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why sometimes you see some some guys that we often blame it on drugs.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also because of the acting that I used to be so hot on the hot tub and</p>
<p>sometimes they go to the down deep so they they they they they the boat extreme, you</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>You got to be psychologically tough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m so excited to see you challenge yourself in that direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing that I&rsquo;m a little bit afraid.</p>
<p>That happened to me.</p>
<p>I really hope I&rsquo;ll always be, you know, like a problem, having a problem to control my</p>
<p>emotion be too much extreme.</p>
<p>I hope it does not happen to me.</p>
<p>And if I feel that I&rsquo;m going towards that, I&rsquo;m going to, you know, give up on my new</p>
<p>objective and find something else to to achieve.</p>
<p>But in your personal life, you want to be real with your emotions.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, you know, just like with biceps, you don&rsquo;t want biceps that are too big.</p>
<p>You are real, but you are extreme real.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s what I think something that could happen to actors sometimes</p>
<p>when they go too much into their emotion.</p>
<p>Like we talk about like something guys that that that commit commit suicide, perhaps,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t know their real life, but it could be something that they get so</p>
<p>much into their character.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand it at first because I never had acting class.</p>
<p>But after a while that you have acting class, now you start to realize that, yeah, I understand</p>
<p>why some actor get caught up in their emotion, because that can have an influence on their</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on a fascinating journey, George.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how much it means to me that you&rsquo;ll be so nice to me, that you&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>me so much respect.</p>
<p>Just that that tells everything I need to know about you as a human being with everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve accomplished.</p>
<p>You waste all your time and you&rsquo;re so nice to me just as a fellow human being, man.</p>
<p>I have so much respect from so honored and the energy you give me by just even showing</p>
<p>up here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll carry that forward for a long time to come, George.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Now, thank you, Lex, for having me on the show.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been looking to talk to you for a long time.</p>
<p>For me, talking to a guy like you, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a great learning experience because I always</p>
<p>learn.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s life is fascinating to me.</p>
<p>And all the experience that we have in life, you know, it&rsquo;s something that can make us</p>
<p>grow.</p>
<p>And this experience for me just, you know, make me grow as as well.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Plus, we look pretty damn sharp today.</p>
