    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>Recently, the Huberman Lab Podcast hosted a live event</p>
<p>at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It was entitled the Brain-Body Contract.</p>
<p>The first part of the evening was a lecture</p>
<p>about science and science-based tools</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>The second half was a question and answer period</p>
<p>in which the audience asked me questions from the podcast</p>
<p>or related to their own interests</p>
<p>or things that they&rsquo;ve gleaned from social media</p>
<p>or just general questions about mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>And I answered those questions for them.</p>
<p>We wanted to make the recorded version</p>
<p>of that question and answer session available to everybody,</p>
<p>regardless of who could attend.</p>
<p>So what follows is the question and answer period</p>
<p>from the Wiltern Theater Brain-Body Contract</p>
<p>live Huberman Lab event.</p>
<p>Want to be sure to thank the sponsors from that event.</p>
<p>They were 8sleep, which makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with heating and cooling capacity.</p>
<p>I started sleeping on an 8sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>about eight months ago,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>I sleep so much deeper.</p>
<p>I wake up far less during the middle of the night,</p>
<p>if at all, and I wake up feeling far better</p>
<p>than I ever have, even after the same amount of sleep.</p>
<p>In fact, I love my 8sleep so much that when I travel,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m quite bothered that Airbnbs and hotels</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have 8sleep mattress covers on them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve even shipped my 8sleep mattress cover out</p>
<p>to meet me in the location that I arrived to</p>
<p>so that I get the best possible sleep.</p>
<p>If you want to try 8sleep,</p>
<p>you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to save up to $400 off their SleepFit holiday bundle,</p>
<p>which includes their new pod three cover.</p>
<p>8sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom,</p>
<p>select countries in the EU and Australia.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s 8sleep.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to also thank our supplement partner, Momentus.</p>
<p>They make the very highest quality supplements.</p>
<p>They ship internationally.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve formulated supplements</p>
<p>as single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that match what is discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in any of those supplements,</p>
<p>please go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now without further ado,</p>
<p>the question and answer period</p>
<p>from the Huberman Lab live event in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;The Daily Show with Dr. Z&rdquo;]</p>
<p>[&ldquo;The Daily Show with Dr. Z&rdquo;]</p>
<p>What occurs in the mind body when you have ADHD?</p>
<p>Are there ways to address it without medication?</p>
<p>Thank you for this question.</p>
<p>So attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</p>
<p>used to be called ADD.</p>
<p>The hyperactivity part is a little misleading.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not a clinician here.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know works for some people,</p>
<p>and yet there are always going to be side effects</p>
<p>of any kind of chemical manipulation,</p>
<p>which is that we know that people,</p>
<p>kids and adults with ADHD,</p>
<p>actually have a tremendous capacity to focus</p>
<p>if they like what they&rsquo;re focusing on.</p>
<p>You take a kid with ADHD who can&rsquo;t focus</p>
<p>and you give them their favorite video game</p>
<p>and they are a laser.</p>
<p>The threshold to access the dopamine system is higher.</p>
<p>And dopamine has this incredible ability</p>
<p>to focus the brain and other aspects of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Certainly if people require medication,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you to stop taking that medication.</p>
<p>But the focus training exercises</p>
<p>that have been explored mainly in China,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re starting to be explored over here as well,</p>
<p>do seem to be of benefit.</p>
<p>And these are, as they sound,</p>
<p>they use them in schools in China now,</p>
<p>which are literally visual focus exercises.</p>
<p>Your mental focus,</p>
<p>that is your ability to focus on things cognitively,</p>
<p>follows your visual focus.</p>
<p>And of course, your stress will anchor your,</p>
<p>essentially put you in a soda straw view of the world.</p>
<p>So yes, there are non-medication-based treatments.</p>
<p>By medication, I&rsquo;m assuming you mean prescription medication.</p>
<p>There are, of course, supplement-based medications</p>
<p>that will increase dopamine, mainly L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>Again, this is something to think carefully about</p>
<p>before you start tampering with your dopamine system.</p>
<p>The L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine,</p>
<p>so it will raise your dopamine levels.</p>
<p>But I believe, and you&rsquo;ll hear me say this</p>
<p>as many times as necessary,</p>
<p>that one should, if you can,</p>
<p>rely on behavioral tools first.</p>
<p>Then, of course, sleep and nutrition are prerequisite,</p>
<p>again, for all mental health, physical health performance.</p>
<p>You simply can&rsquo;t neglect those.</p>
<p>And then, and only then, if all of that isn&rsquo;t working,</p>
<p>to rely on supplement-based tools</p>
<p>or on prescription medication.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, et cetera,</p>
<p>work for ADHD, but some people choose to rely</p>
<p>on more subtle forms of pharmacologic manipulation</p>
<p>like L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>And this focusing exercise essentially consists</p>
<p>of spending one to three minutes</p>
<p>trying to maintain visual focus.</p>
<p>And yes, you are allowed to blink.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why we tend to stare</p>
<p>at something we don&rsquo;t blink,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t let your eyes dry out.</p>
<p>And that can increase your ability</p>
<p>to focus cognitively, and it works.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that focusing always involves refocusing.</p>
<p>We covered a beautiful data set,</p>
<p>not collected by my lab,</p>
<p>by Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab at NYU,</p>
<p>that at roughly 10 minute,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually 13 minute a day meditation of the sort</p>
<p>where you just focus on your breathing,</p>
<p>has been shown to improve focus significantly.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we hear about this more?</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s now Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU,</p>
<p>and all the students are hearing about it.</p>
<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>but it takes a little bit of discipline.</p>
<p>For some reason, 10 minute a day type meditation</p>
<p>is something that very few people follow consistently.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re looking for non-medication based treatments</p>
<p>for ADHD, or you&rsquo;re somebody who just struggles with focus,</p>
<p>the focusing exercise or the meditation I just described</p>
<p>can be very useful.</p>
<p>So say the data.</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks for bringing up space-time bridging.</p>
<p>Are people familiar with what space-time bridging is?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about it.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks for bringing that up.</p>
<p>We actually have an episode on meditation</p>
<p>coming up soon where I cover it.</p>
<p>And I talked about it long ago,</p>
<p>and then I kind of abandoned it</p>
<p>because, well, we wanted more data.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pretty interesting technique.</p>
<p>You know, if you think about the nervous system</p>
<p>and vision in particular,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re not a sighted person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>you could do this with your hearing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna assume most people here are sighted.</p>
<p>If not, just translate this to the auditory system.</p>
<p>You have this incredible ability to close your eyes</p>
<p>and focus, for instance, on,</p>
<p>people talk about the third eye center,</p>
<p>you know, focusing right behind your forehead.</p>
<p>Do you know why people do that when they meditate?</p>
<p>The reason is that you actually have no sensation</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one place to focus your attention</p>
<p>for which you abandon sensation.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If I think about any portion of my body or my breathing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m either, I&rsquo;m going to sense what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to perceive my inner landscape,</p>
<p>so-called interoception,</p>
<p>or my outer, if I look out into the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exteroception.</p>
<p>When you focus your attention with your eyes closed,</p>
<p>just, you do have to close your eyes</p>
<p>just behind your forehead,</p>
<p>you are focusing on your thinking.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Sort of obvious, but I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>at least to me, it had never been stated that clearly.</p>
<p>Again, one of the problems</p>
<p>with some of the more traditional practices,</p>
<p>but also the problem with science,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a shrouding of everything</p>
<p>in very complex language, which sucks.</p>
<p>Why does it suck?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a separator.</p>
<p>You eliminate the number of people</p>
<p>that could be brought to potentially useful practices.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like it when people, including myself,</p>
<p>overuse mechanism and descriptions of, you know,</p>
<p>fancy phrases to mask basic principles.</p>
<p>So simplest language, I think is a,</p>
<p>it tends to unify people around the practices.</p>
<p>So when you focus on this so-called third eye center,</p>
<p>right, or a spot right behind your forehead,</p>
<p>or on your breath,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little tricky with the breath,</p>
<p>but when you focus on your frontal cortex,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to sense,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no sensory neurons there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no touch, there&rsquo;s no pain, nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in these gory movies, you know,</p>
<p>you can take the skull off,</p>
<p>or in neurosurgeries, they&rsquo;re poking around in there,</p>
<p>and the person&rsquo;s playing a violin.</p>
<p>Like no anesthetic, no anesthetic,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require anesthetic, there&rsquo;s no sensory neurons.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t sense anything there.</p>
<p>So space-time bridging involves,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essentially a meditation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really a perceptual exercise.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going with this,</p>
<p>is it starts by closing your eyes</p>
<p>and focusing on that location</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s no sensation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only thought,</p>
<p>and then opening your eyes and focusing on a location,</p>
<p>maybe about the distance of your hand,</p>
<p>and you focus also on your breathing.</p>
<p>So you sort of imagine a kind of a tether between that.</p>
<p>You can split your attention to these two locations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about your body,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking about a location outside of you,</p>
<p>and then you, while continuing to think about your body,</p>
<p>so-called interoception, focused on your breathing,</p>
<p>you focus further out, and then further out,</p>
<p>and then further out,</p>
<p>and then ultimately, you know that little cartoon</p>
<p>or meme where they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just a little blue dot floating in a big universe,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s supposed to make all your problems go away?</p>
<p>It kind of works because what you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve expanded your perception,</p>
<p>and you go, oh yeah, the stuff that&rsquo;s happening in here</p>
<p>is really important when I&rsquo;m focused</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s happening in here,</p>
<p>but when I&rsquo;m focused on what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and the vastness of all this,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just a little pale blue dot and all that,</p>
<p>it changes your perception,</p>
<p>not just your visual perception, obviously.</p>
<p>Changing your visual perception</p>
<p>changes your cognitive perception,</p>
<p>which changes your emotional experience.</p>
<p>So the space-time bridging is a perceptual exercise</p>
<p>where you step from focusing internally</p>
<p>to focusing externally at a short distance,</p>
<p>then a further distance, further distance, further distance,</p>
<p>and then trying to imagine yourself</p>
<p>in this larger landscape.</p>
<p>It sounds very mystical,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually very neurobiological,</p>
<p>and it captures something really amazing.</p>
<p>Why is the T in there, the time, space-time bridging?</p>
<p>Because this is space, but time is in there</p>
<p>because when you focus in close,</p>
<p>your slicing of time is finer.</p>
<p>You notice the subtle fluctuations in your breathing</p>
<p>and things that are happening up close,</p>
<p>whereas when you focus further out,</p>
<p>your perception of time actually changes,</p>
<p>which is why in panoramic vision we are calm.</p>
<p>And when you think about we&rsquo;re just a pale blue dot</p>
<p>and we mostly only live to about 85 or maybe 100 years old,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening right now,</p>
<p>my boss being a jerk and all that doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>because the earth is spinning and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>which is all true and is the stuff of philosophy</p>
<p>and mindfulness and I think is beautiful.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re really doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re changing your time perception</p>
<p>by changing your space perception.</p>
<p>So space-time bridging is very useful</p>
<p>because most people get locked at one step,</p>
<p>one of these stations,</p>
<p>especially under conditions of stress.</p>
<p>And people who have trouble focusing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought this up in this context of ADHD,</p>
<p>people who have a hard time focusing</p>
<p>whether or not they have ADHD or not</p>
<p>tend to skip back and forth</p>
<p>between different space-time domains</p>
<p>as we call them in science.</p>
<p>So this is a simple exercise that you can do</p>
<p>focusing internally, then stepping out externally,</p>
<p>then stepping back in,</p>
<p>all the while paying attention to your inner landscape</p>
<p>just simply by focusing on your breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool that we&rsquo;re still collecting data on</p>
<p>in terms of its utility, but people are already using it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think of it as a meditation,</p>
<p>I think of it as a perceptual exercise.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking that.</p>
<p>Okay, as a teenager, what are five things</p>
<p>you would recommend to physically feel my best?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a 15-year-old surfer</p>
<p>who attends high school and plays soccer.</p>
<p>It sounds like you&rsquo;re doing a lot of things right.</p>
<p>To physically feel your best.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m gonna grasp at some context here</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not, that&rsquo;s not within reach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming if you are doing all these things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hopefully doing a bunch of other things too,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to be demands on you</p>
<p>that you, probably some of them you don&rsquo;t wanna do,</p>
<p>school and things like that,</p>
<p>are going to have varying levels of joy and delight</p>
<p>and demand of things you don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna default always to the simplest of tools,</p>
<p>but I certainly think that even as a 15-year-old,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not already getting lots and lots of sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be great.</p>
<p>Tell your parents that I said</p>
<p>you should get lots and lots of sleep,</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re not sleeping through classes.</p>
<p>I am a professor after all.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell you otherwise.</p>
<p>You know, I would say if I could travel back in time</p>
<p>as a 15-year-old, I would encourage you</p>
<p>to cultivate some sort of mindfulness practice.</p>
<p>I know this sounds a little cliche,</p>
<p>but having some awareness of your thinking</p>
<p>about your thinking is good,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m actually not going to say sit down</p>
<p>and meditate for 10 minutes a day or do NSDR.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not gonna tell you that.</p>
<p>I think given how plastic your brain is,</p>
<p>how much it&rsquo;s changing at 15,</p>
<p>I would encourage you,</p>
<p>and maybe you would set a timer for this,</p>
<p>to actually develop just a really keen awareness</p>
<p>of what stresses you out, what relaxes you,</p>
<p>what delights you, et cetera,</p>
<p>and just to simply develop an awareness of that,</p>
<p>because those are your antennae.</p>
<p>And I certainly had a meditation practice as a youth,</p>
<p>mostly given to me because I was a little haywire</p>
<p>and I needed it, and it worked pretty well.</p>
<p>But I think in retrospect,</p>
<p>what I wish I had developed was more of a sense</p>
<p>of how I navigated stress or things,</p>
<p>and things I enjoyed and things I didn&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>
<p>And I would just encourage you to have a general awareness,</p>
<p>try and detect and learn about what raises your adrenaline,</p>
<p>what raises your dopamine, what raises your serotonin,</p>
<p>and then start thinking about tools.</p>
<p>But again, the awareness is going to be very valuable.</p>
<p>And gosh, as a 15-year-old,</p>
<p>you are in this amazing blessed period</p>
<p>of heightened neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Should we all be so lucky?</p>
<p>So enjoy it.</p>
<p>Next question, please.</p>
<p>Clarity on adrenaline regarding cold water.</p>
<p>Should we wait to feel the rise of adrenaline</p>
<p>that get me out of here feeling,</p>
<p>and the fall of it before bailing?</p>
<p>Yes, provided it doesn&rsquo;t kill you.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t wanna say cold water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to kill yourself with cold water,</p>
<p>provided your head&rsquo;s above and you&rsquo;re breathing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, sorry, my podcast producer&rsquo;s always like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help that, anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great tool.</p>
<p>And different days, it&rsquo;ll feel different.</p>
<p>So for instance, doing cold,</p>
<p>any kind of adrenaline and deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>or adrenaline increasing activity early in the day,</p>
<p>you might find that you are more,</p>
<p>quote unquote, resilient than later.</p>
<p>In other words, the wall, like,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t wanna do this.</p>
<p>This is actually interesting for,</p>
<p>I think it extends beyond cold water.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you really don&rsquo;t wanna do something.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the fact</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s not the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But assuming it&rsquo;s something that you know you should do,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to do,</p>
<p>you are already in the first wall of adrenaline.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t experience it necessarily</p>
<p>as heightened levels of stress.</p>
<p>You might experience it as heightened levels of fatigue</p>
<p>or a hard time shifting on that kind of activation state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required to move through the thing.</p>
<p>But I do encourage you to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>Of course, and we have an episode coming out tomorrow,</p>
<p>actually, that answers questions like,</p>
<p>should you train if you&rsquo;re sick?</p>
<p>And what if you travel?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s context always.</p>
<p>But I think that you do want to experience,</p>
<p>if you wanna get the most out of the cold water exposure,</p>
<p>and to be more specific, the adrenaline,</p>
<p>then you want to get to that point of,</p>
<p>I really wanna get out of here,</p>
<p>but I know I can stay in safely,</p>
<p>but I really wanna get out of here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little hard to explain,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just so much learning in those short moments</p>
<p>about where your mind goes.</p>
<p>And this sounds very kind of, again, subjective</p>
<p>and maybe a little wishy-washy,</p>
<p>but you can realize great things about yourself</p>
<p>in those moments.</p>
<p>You can find insight in those moments.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that the degree of discomfort,</p>
<p>not just physical, but mental discomfort,</p>
<p>is directly predictive of the pain to pleasure wave</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll experience afterwards.</p>
<p>The reason it feels so good</p>
<p>when you get out of the ice bath and you&rsquo;re showered off,</p>
<p>I always do the warm shower after,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do this end on cold thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it just seems a little too painful.</p>
<p>And then take a warm shower and then you feel great.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the surge of dopamine that we know,</p>
<p>based on a paper published</p>
<p>in the European Journal of Physiology,</p>
<p>lasts many hours and it&rsquo;s a 100 to 200% increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>It is not a subtle effect.</p>
<p>And then people say, well, wait,</p>
<p>is that dopamine gonna crash my dopamine system?</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s a nice slow rise.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m actually not aware of many things</p>
<p>besides love and delight</p>
<p>that can create this long, slow arc of dopamine</p>
<p>lasting many hours.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re aware of other things.</p>
<p>If you are, let me know.</p>
<p>But it turns out that long arc is a true antidepressant.</p>
<p>And my colleague at Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a head of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic,</p>
<p>has talked about in her amazing book,</p>
<p>Dopamine Nation, about patients of hers</p>
<p>that have really helped themselves along</p>
<p>and out of the more depressive phases</p>
<p>of working through addiction</p>
<p>and in just depression in general</p>
<p>through directed cold water therapy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m obviously a fanatic about it</p>
<p>in the sense that it&rsquo;s a powerful,</p>
<p>relatively safe, if done properly,</p>
<p>safe, if done properly,</p>
<p>way to modulate your internal dopamine.</p>
<p>Hopefully I answered your question.</p>
<p>Next question, please.</p>
<p>Sorry, I caught it right as it went off.</p>
<p>The fall as well.</p>
<p>Yes, I think you should get out</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve accomplished something.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get out when you panic, unless it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>How can you train your brain</p>
<p>to feel more confident in moments</p>
<p>where you tend to feel intimidated?</p>
<p>Ah, okay.</p>
<p>These are hard questions.</p>
<p>Because context is tricky here,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know what the context is.</p>
<p>And confidence on short time scales</p>
<p>and then long time scales.</p>
<p>So confidence in school, confidence in career,</p>
<p>those are long, long arc things,</p>
<p>whereas confidence to be able to do something</p>
<p>in the short term is different.</p>
<p>But remember those action sequences</p>
<p>that trigger the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine, I&rsquo;ve mainly talked about</p>
<p>the dark side of dopamine,</p>
<p>but I hopefully also talked about</p>
<p>the sort of upward spiral that dopamine can cause,</p>
<p>mainly by thinking about delight</p>
<p>and things that you really enjoy.</p>
<p>That carries over.</p>
<p>And I would say that you want to micro-slice</p>
<p>the demands of what&rsquo;s maybe got you back</p>
<p>on your heels a bit.</p>
<p>Actually, a good friend of mine who&rsquo;s here tonight,</p>
<p>I think also, my friend Pat,</p>
<p>he has a great way of conceptualizing this,</p>
<p>which is for most all endeavors,</p>
<p>we either feel back on our heels, flat-footed,</p>
<p>or forward center of mass.</p>
<p>Like we can really do something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re flat-footed, we&rsquo;re back on our heels.</p>
<p>And sometimes getting from back on our heels,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call that lack of confidence</p>
<p>to just on two feet and confident enough</p>
<p>to move forward or at least stay in the game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to require,</p>
<p>you could lean on different tools.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say which would be ideal</p>
<p>for the circumstance you have in mind,</p>
<p>but I do think that having a way to calm yourself</p>
<p>will give you access to more resources,</p>
<p>internal resources.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>This was something I meant to bring up</p>
<p>during the discussion about fear versus love, et cetera,</p>
<p>trying to access delight and love.</p>
<p>When we are in a state of fear or stress or anxiety,</p>
<p>the rule set, the options available to us,</p>
<p>and indeed our creativity, is greatly diminished.</p>
<p>And this has to do with the way</p>
<p>that the prefrontal cortex interacts</p>
<p>with an area of the brain called the insula,</p>
<p>which relates to our internal landscape.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this weird phenomenon,</p>
<p>which is that normally our brain, our thinking brain,</p>
<p>and our rule-setting brain,</p>
<p>it leads the brain parts that control</p>
<p>and pay attention to how we feel internally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, for instance, if you feel a little nervous,</p>
<p>you can still do something.</p>
<p>At some point, you get stressed enough,</p>
<p>and we know this from work by my colleague, David Spiegel,</p>
<p>it reverses, and these areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are paying attention, like how flushed my face is</p>
<p>or whether or not I&rsquo;m sweating or am I breathing,</p>
<p>actually start to shut down creative decision-making.</p>
<p>So I would say the way to have more confidence</p>
<p>is to learn to control that stress</p>
<p>and keep the part of your brain,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex is that part,</p>
<p>that can come up with new rules that can be funny,</p>
<p>that can be creative, that keeps that brain part leading.</p>
<p>The way I think about this is the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is sort of like the coach,</p>
<p>and the rest of your brain are sort of like the players.</p>
<p>And if you get too stressed,</p>
<p>the players start to lead the game,</p>
<p>and the coach follows and kind of drags them along.</p>
<p>So I would encourage you to focus</p>
<p>on real-time stress modulation</p>
<p>and to raise your stress threshold</p>
<p>using the sorts of tools we talked about,</p>
<p>and to register your wins.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get into this in too much detail,</p>
<p>but one of the amazing things about the dopamine system</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s highly subject to your interpretation.</p>
<p>If you tell yourself that a fail was a win,</p>
<p>and you can see or conceptualize some way</p>
<p>in which that&rsquo;s actually true,</p>
<p>you get to tap into the dopamine system.</p>
<p>You might think that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>You can cheat your own brain.</p>
<p>You can cheat your own neurochemistry, and indeed you can.</p>
<p>You can change the time, space-time referencing.</p>
<p>We see this with examples</p>
<p>like Nelson Mandela or Viktor Frankl.</p>
<p>You know, you read their stories, right?</p>
<p>Trapped in little cells, right?</p>
<p>Confined, imprisoned.</p>
<p>And they come up with new ways to access the dopamine system</p>
<p>by now not thinking about what they&rsquo;re not getting,</p>
<p>but thinking about what they can control</p>
<p>in their immediate experience.</p>
<p>Many, many examples of this</p>
<p>throughout literature and history.</p>
<p>And the dopamine system is the life force system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that in any loose way.</p>
<p>Dopamine is life force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the wish and the desire to continue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s persistence.</p>
<p>And so if you can think about</p>
<p>what might seem like a failure</p>
<p>and really spend some time thinking about</p>
<p>not the potential wins on the outside,</p>
<p>but how you can conceptualize</p>
<p>that as a potential win internally,</p>
<p>you really do get to achieve an internal chemical win.</p>
<p>And that chemical win sets you up for more real wins,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible how contextualized the dopamine system is,</p>
<p>but if it weren&rsquo;t, why would it matter</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about money or mates or food</p>
<p>or job or school?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get 50 reward systems and motivation systems.</p>
<p>You get one, and that&rsquo;s the dopamine system.</p>
<p>Next question, please.</p>
<p>What is the competing mechanism</p>
<p>behind bilateral eye movement, EMDR,</p>
<p>that helps resolve psychological trauma?</p>
<p>The competing mechanism.</p>
<p>Well, let me try and answer as best I can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand the full extent of the question,</p>
<p>but let me, EMDR, moving your eyes from side to side,</p>
<p>right, and then recounting a trauma is a very common</p>
<p>and actually one of the four approved treatments</p>
<p>that are behavioral for trauma.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s taken seriously in the psychiatric</p>
<p>and psychological community for good reason.</p>
<p>It tends to work best for single event traumas</p>
<p>as opposed to like entire childhoods.</p>
<p>No joke there, like, you know,</p>
<p>some people have their entire childhood was traumatic.</p>
<p>Other people, they experience a trauma,</p>
<p>a single event trauma or repeated periods</p>
<p>of the same or similar type of trauma.</p>
<p>Eye movements from side to side have been shown</p>
<p>in a number of studies to very potently reduce</p>
<p>the activity of a brain structure called the amygdala,</p>
<p>which most people are familiar with</p>
<p>because of the character from the Star Wars movie,</p>
<p>Amygdala.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a neuroscientist somewhere on that team.</p>
<p>It is indeed a threat detection center.</p>
<p>And when you move through space, not outer space,</p>
<p>but when you walk like this,</p>
<p>your eyes actually generate these subtle side to side shifts</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re focusing on a specific target.</p>
<p>And my lab and other laboratories have found</p>
<p>that that leads to a very potent quieting</p>
<p>of the threat detection system.</p>
<p>And then EMDR is essentially a process of pairing</p>
<p>that calmer state with no threat detection system</p>
<p>activated with the recount of something</p>
<p>that normally would be quite triggering.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ve heard of Pavlovian conditioning,</p>
<p>like a bell rings and the animal gets fed</p>
<p>and animal salivates,</p>
<p>eventually just the bell will evoke the salivation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing the reverse of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called behavioral desensitization.</p>
<p>It has an underlying mechanism, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the idea is to pair a calm state</p>
<p>with recount of something.</p>
<p>It has been shown to be successful.</p>
<p>There are people who think</p>
<p>that the side to side eye movements</p>
<p>and the recount of trauma may actually be invoking</p>
<p>some form of hypnosis.</p>
<p>My colleague, David Spiegel, expert in clinical hypnosis.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s appeared on my podcast, Rich Roll&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>and a few other podcasts and talks about this.</p>
<p>It is not stage hypnosis, it&rsquo;s clinical hypnosis.</p>
<p>So there may be something going on there.</p>
<p>EMDR, again, some people get great relief from it.</p>
<p>Other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s kind of nice is that this eye movements</p>
<p>from side to side or simply taking a walk,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not looking at your phone</p>
<p>and not allowing your eyes to move from side to side</p>
<p>is a very good way to shut down the fear and stress system.</p>
<p>So taking a walk, I think is relaxing for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And there are data showing that part of the reason</p>
<p>why animals scratch at the door and wanna go for a walk</p>
<p>may not actually be the exercise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of an anxiety</p>
<p>and then an anxiety relief that occurs.</p>
<p>Of course, they probably have to go to the bathroom too.</p>
<p>One of Costello&rsquo;s great joys in life</p>
<p>was just peeing on everything.</p>
<p>Outdoors, thankfully.</p>
<p>So the psychological trauma rewiring,</p>
<p>unfortunately, there haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>a lot of brain imaging studies</p>
<p>looking at this long-term of how well EMDR works.</p>
<p>What I think is going to happen in the next few years,</p>
<p>by the way, is it is not going to be a discussion around,</p>
<p>should you do EMDR?</p>
<p>Should you do transcranial magnetic stimulation?</p>
<p>Should you do behavioral therapy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be combination therapies,</p>
<p>combination therapies,</p>
<p>including pharmacologic manipulations</p>
<p>to essentially give a boost to the systems</p>
<p>that encourage neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>like dopamine and serotonin and adrenaline,</p>
<p>and then also then perform EMDR.</p>
<p>And if you wanna talk about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the landscape of clinical trials</p>
<p>on some of the psychedelics, I&rsquo;m happy to talk about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still illegal,</p>
<p>but they are being used in clinical trials</p>
<p>and very interesting stuff is happening there.</p>
<p>Okay, next question, please.</p>
<p>What new research or interventions</p>
<p>are you most excited about</p>
<p>in the realm of health and wellness?</p>
<p>So what I think is going to be very interesting</p>
<p>in the next few years really reflects my obsession</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve seen a little bit of tonight,</p>
<p>but the thing that I think is going to be most useful,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen this in science before,</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;re going to see it in health and wellness,</p>
<p>is that there are all these tools and all these people,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s saying this and she&rsquo;s saying that,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re going to start paying attention to</p>
<p>is what are the common themes, right?</p>
<p>And a broader and more important theme</p>
<p>is going to be one of modulation versus mediation.</p>
<p>What do I mean?</p>
<p>Well, if someone were to pull a fire alarm right now,</p>
<p>and please don&rsquo;t, that will shift our attention</p>
<p>and make it hard to focus on what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>and knowing me, I&rsquo;d probably just stay up here talking.</p>
<p>Do we think that fire alarms mediate attention?</p>
<p>No, they modulate it, right?</p>
<p>If it were very, very cold in this room</p>
<p>like it was when we first got here tonight,</p>
<p>the Arctic cold, hopefully it&rsquo;s warmed up a bit.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m so sorry, so sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, I attempted to, yeah.</p>
<p>I almost thought maybe we all just do a bunch of breathing</p>
<p>to heat up like adrenaline release,</p>
<p>but these days getting groups of people</p>
<p>all breathe on each other is not exactly,</p>
<p>I can see that might go the wrong way</p>
<p>in terms of what people interpret.</p>
<p>So the idea here is that certain things</p>
<p>directly mediate something,</p>
<p>like a physiological side directly calms you down quickly.</p>
<p>It mediates the calming response.</p>
<p>Getting good sleep makes you less easily triggered.</p>
<p>It modulates stress.</p>
<p>But is sleeping directly mediating stress control?</p>
<p>No, and I think this is really important</p>
<p>and this brings up the topic of the gut brain axis.</p>
<p>The gut is rich with these little bugs,</p>
<p>bacteria, trillions of them,</p>
<p>which is an eerie thought to me,</p>
<p>but also the surface of your skin,</p>
<p>the surface of your eyes,</p>
<p>you have a skin microbiome, a nasal microbiome,</p>
<p>every mucosal lining has a microbiome.</p>
<p>In fact, think about this.</p>
<p>This is a crazy but worthwhile tangent.</p>
<p>Have you ever bitten the inside of your mouth?</p>
<p>It sucks, right?</p>
<p>And you get a cut and it hurts.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>The inside of your mouth heals without a scar.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>Weird, right?</p>
<p>You cut anywhere else on your body</p>
<p>and depending on how well you heal</p>
<p>and your age and your immune status,</p>
<p>you get a scar.</p>
<p>Your mouth is filled with bacteria</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s open to the world.</p>
<p>But the gut microbiome, provided it&rsquo;s healthy,</p>
<p>provides an incredible ability to heal quickly.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m not somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done a lot of acupuncture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve went a few times</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s interesting science</p>
<p>happening on acupuncture,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the first thing they do</p>
<p>when you walk in there?</p>
<p>And then they go, oh yeah.</p>
<p>And they have this cool intuition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not based on Western mechanistic science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of an intuition based on millions,</p>
<p>if not billions of data points</p>
<p>that have been put into these charts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>And what they are looking at, I believe,</p>
<p>and from what my colleagues who work on microbiome</p>
<p>tell me is they can look at the pallor of your tongue,</p>
<p>in particular, in the back</p>
<p>and get a sense of whether or not</p>
<p>the microbiome there is of the appropriate stuff.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t go, oh, lactobacillus,</p>
<p>and then bacillus,</p>
<p>they all end in illus, right?</p>
<p>But then, oh, you&rsquo;re dysbiotic.</p>
<p>Instead, they get a sense.</p>
<p>Now, parents of small babies</p>
<p>learn to detect all sorts of things</p>
<p>coming out of essentially every orifice of the child.</p>
<p>As a readout of health,</p>
<p>because the child doesn&rsquo;t have language.</p>
<p>And the dog owners, you know,</p>
<p>unfortunately, you learn to do this, too.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, probably for better, right?</p>
<p>So we have this intuition about gut health,</p>
<p>but gut health would be another example</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very clear now that fiber can be helpful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mostly consuming these fermented foods</p>
<p>that have been used for ages,</p>
<p>but low-sugar fermented foods of the natto,</p>
<p>kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, et cetera,</p>
<p>like all these things,</p>
<p>depending on which culture you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>they come in different forms,</p>
<p>certain yogurts, et cetera,</p>
<p>that allow the gut to be healthy,</p>
<p>and it modulates a huge number of systems.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re going to cure depression</p>
<p>by adjusting your gut microbiome,</p>
<p>but if your gut microbiota are not well,</p>
<p>and you improve that,</p>
<p>it will indeed shift the neurotransmitter systems</p>
<p>of your brain and give you a elevated mood.</p>
<p>That shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise anymore,</p>
<p>but I think that the whole world thinks like,</p>
<p>gosh, it must be the serotonin in the gut.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually not serotonin in the gut,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that the gut microbiota create chemicals</p>
<p>that actually become serotonin in the brain,</p>
<p>or become dopamine in the brain.</p>
<p>And so I think that the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>I would put in the same category,</p>
<p>although not quite as important,</p>
<p>I would put it in the category of like sleep.</p>
<p>It modulates a huge number of other processes,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mediate them.</p>
<p>So sunlight, sleep, healthy gut microbiome,</p>
<p>exercise, good nutrition, social connection,</p>
<p>these things all create this general milieu</p>
<p>or environment of health.</p>
<p>I would like to see more distinction</p>
<p>between modulating and mediating effects</p>
<p>and tools out there,</p>
<p>because I also see a lot of unnecessary argument.</p>
<p>People are like, there&rsquo;s no example</p>
<p>that improving your gut microbiome cures depressions.</p>
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but there are really good examples</p>
<p>if your gut microbiome is off</p>
<p>that improving it can improve mood,</p>
<p>which depending on where you are</p>
<p>on that spectrum of depression can really relieve things.</p>
<p>So I think that the future of health,</p>
<p>we hear so much about personalized medicine</p>
<p>and match to your genome,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t even have the basic,</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t even have the basics right.</p>
<p>And if you watch or listen to the podcast long enough,</p>
<p>hopefully certain themes start to kind of repeat themselves.</p>
<p>But a key theme that you learn in science,</p>
<p>you teach your students,</p>
<p>does it modulate or does it mediate it?</p>
<p>You need to be careful with your language there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s great information</p>
<p>or as we say, interpretational power there.</p>
<p>If you understand the difference,</p>
<p>then I think we can go a long way</p>
<p>by making that distinction modulating versus mediating.</p>
<p>There are probably other things that modulate health</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m overlooking now,</p>
<p>just because of the flow that I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>The cool mitt.</p>
<p>Yeah, the cool mitt.</p>
<p>Palmer cooling.</p>
<p>Okay, I promised to talk about Palmer cooling.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll do it now.</p>
<p>Palmer cooling, they changed the Q&amp;A format.</p>
<p>What can I say?</p>
<p>This is like teaching in the classroom.</p>
<p>All right, very briefly,</p>
<p>that Palmer cooling,</p>
<p>which is essentially placing,</p>
<p>you can cool the core of the body most quickly</p>
<p>by placing cold objects on the hands,</p>
<p>the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>or on the top of the face</p>
<p>because of the arrangement of vasculature.</p>
<p>Normally, you&rsquo;ve got this arteries,</p>
<p>capillaries, veins things,</p>
<p>but at those locations in the body,</p>
<p>you skip the capillaries</p>
<p>and you can basically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really passing cool into the body,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re cooling off the core of the body more quickly.</p>
<p>And if you do that in between sets of exercise</p>
<p>or during a run or cycling,</p>
<p>you can dramatically increase your ability to continue.</p>
<p>I actually use the cool mitt for cognitive work,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need a cool mitt.</p>
<p>Sorry, cool mitt, guys.</p>
<p>You can just get a thing of ice water</p>
<p>or just very cold water.</p>
<p>And I know it sounds trivially easy,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually just cooling your core</p>
<p>by putting your hands or even one hand</p>
<p>on a relatively cold thing of water or ice,</p>
<p>but not so cold that it constricts the vasculature there.</p>
<p>This is the incredible work of my colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>Dr. Craig Heller.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t more people do this</p>
<p>if you can double the amount of endurance,</p>
<p>believe it or not,</p>
<p>double the number of sets of exercise you can do</p>
<p>or feel more alert and do more cognitive work?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t more people do it?</p>
<p>Because people just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And it sounds crazy.</p>
<p>It really sounds crazy, but it&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>And I wish more people would do it.</p>
<p>The athletes at Stanford do it.</p>
<p>People in the military do it.</p>
<p>So people who know, know, and they use it, enjoy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s almost like seems too off target</p>
<p>from what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, for some reason,</p>
<p>people are finally on board breathing,</p>
<p>like in a specific way as a useful tool.</p>
<p>A few years ago, no one was into that.</p>
<p>I mean, just think of how far we&rsquo;ve come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>People are talking about psychedelics,</p>
<p>meditation, breathing.</p>
<p>I think the pandemic for all its pains</p>
<p>and what a challenging period for all sorts of reasons</p>
<p>did wake people up to the idea</p>
<p>that you have to take control over your health</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no magic fairy coming to do it for you.</p>
<p>And with all due respect, there&rsquo;s no government agency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna like drop off the kit at your front door</p>
<p>of like, here&rsquo;s how you take good care of yourself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just not gonna happen.</p>
<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t happen under any circumstances.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a personal responsibility issue.</p>
<p>Huh, all right, what lessons from skateboarding?</p>
<p>The failure part, you know, the failure, failure, failure.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, you know, skateboarding</p>
<p>never was a good skateboarder.</p>
<p>Still have close friends in that community</p>
<p>and our photographer and the guy who does all the visuals</p>
<p>and the other guys that do the visuals for our podcast,</p>
<p>Mike Blayback and Chris and Martin</p>
<p>are all of that community.</p>
<p>You know, I think that for me, that community was really,</p>
<p>as Mike will sometimes say, skateboarders hate everything,</p>
<p>meaning they have a very high threshold</p>
<p>for what they consider acceptable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just what you do, it&rsquo;s how you do it.</p>
<p>Super important.</p>
<p>And I think in neuroscience, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>In science in general, there&rsquo;s so many papers</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many experiments,</p>
<p>like how do you navigate that landscape?</p>
<p>I think it helped me develop a sense of taste.</p>
<p>But the taste that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is not necessarily a taste of which science is cool</p>
<p>or not cool, that too.</p>
<p>But it came through a few times tonight</p>
<p>when I was talking about my mentors.</p>
<p>You know, I picked back then skateboarding</p>
<p>because I really liked the people.</p>
<p>And also you didn&rsquo;t need your parents to go to a game.</p>
<p>And so that worked for me.</p>
<p>And you could kind of make your own schedule.</p>
<p>And I do think it&rsquo;s very important to the extent</p>
<p>that you can in science and in everything</p>
<p>to surround yourself with the kinds of people</p>
<p>that you just really enjoy being around.</p>
<p>And so to me, the podcast running a lab</p>
<p>feels a lot like skateboarding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same neurochemical systems firing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, yeah, that one.</p>
<p>Next favorite fun.</p>
<p>Oh, oh wait, no, that&rsquo;s inappropriate.</p>
<p>I do have a Feynman story, but it&rsquo;s inappropriate.</p>
<p>Darn it.</p>
<p>Maybe sometime.</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t drink.</p>
<p>Good decision making.</p>
<p>Well, I read all of Feynman&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>So I had the pleasure, I never met him.</p>
<p>He was dead before I was born.</p>
<p>But my dad did and he had good Feynman stories</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re inappropriate.</p>
<p>So the cool thing about Feynman, right,</p>
<p>was that he didn&rsquo;t really care</p>
<p>if people understood the specifics</p>
<p>of what he was talking about.</p>
<p>He just wanted people to get turned on</p>
<p>to how amazing physics was.</p>
<p>And he loved general principles.</p>
<p>And one of the things, you know,</p>
<p>the example that&rsquo;s sometimes given,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of you are familiar</p>
<p>with the Feynman books, but surely you&rsquo;re joking,</p>
<p>Mr. Feynman, or what do you care?</p>
<p>What do other people think?</p>
<p>All of that stuff, it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>He picked locks.</p>
<p>You know, we worked at Los Alamos Labs.</p>
<p>They were working on the bomb.</p>
<p>And he basically, well, there and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And every morning, the offices used to come in</p>
<p>and he would spread all the top secret papers</p>
<p>out on the floor.</p>
<p>He would break into the safes at night</p>
<p>and then they were perplexed who could do this.</p>
<p>And he liked safe cracking.</p>
<p>Literally like national security secrets,</p>
<p>just for fun, prankster.</p>
<p>He also bongo drum naked on the roof of Caltech.</p>
<p>And he did most of his writing of theorems in strip clubs.</p>
<p>Fact.</p>
<p>Learned to draw late in life,</p>
<p>was really into flotation tanks,</p>
<p>and very curious about, but never did psychedelics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as I understand.</p>
<p>But one of the cool Feynman factoids</p>
<p>is that when he was a kid,</p>
<p>he talked about when he was a child</p>
<p>that his dad used to take him birdwatching</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d say, oh, well, that&rsquo;s a whatever scrub jay</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a whatever, whatever thrush.</p>
<p>And his dad said, no,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cloud your mind with naming and taxonomy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not meaningful</p>
<p>because then what if it&rsquo;s the different,</p>
<p>you know, the pygmy thrush or the lesser this or that.</p>
<p>The more important thing is to start to identify principles</p>
<p>of why certain birds behave one way</p>
<p>and certain birds behave another</p>
<p>and to start finding the commonalities and the regularities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a theme that I obviously tonight</p>
<p>have tried to impose.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually something</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t do in podcasts necessarily</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t thread across 40 episodes</p>
<p>or something like that in the same way</p>
<p>that I could in an evening like this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an appropriate Feynman story.</p>
<p>Also, it just seemed like a delightful guy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little bit street, right?</p>
<p>He had that thick accent.</p>
<p>He was from far Rockaway,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t really care much what people thought</p>
<p>or he did and he pretended he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Careful when people tell you</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care what people think.</p>
<p>But I think he did to the extent</p>
<p>that it still allow him to get the message out there.</p>
<p>Okay, next question, please.</p>
<p>My horse.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I delight in all things animals,</p>
<p>but especially horses</p>
<p>because my high school girlfriend had a horse</p>
<p>and they do that thing where people go,</p>
<p>oh, you know, horses can detect</p>
<p>how they know more about you than you know.</p>
<p>And then I get into the horse</p>
<p>and the horse is like, you know, this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a litmus test.</p>
<p>Having a girlfriend with a horse</p>
<p>was very intimidating for me, actually.</p>
<p>I felt like I had to compete with the horse.</p>
<p>She spent all this time with the horse.</p>
<p>He was very large, very like, you know.</p>
<p>Anyway, eventually I broke the horse.</p>
<p>Okay, my horse does the double inhale-long exhale often.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bit of a stressy guy.</p>
<p>Warm blood, yeah?</p>
<p>Warm blood.</p>
<p>I used to work at the barn.</p>
<p>I used to shovel manure and work at the barn.</p>
<p>She brought her horse to college.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how she followed her off to college.</p>
<p>He never would have gone to college</p>
<p>if she hadn&rsquo;t gone to college.</p>
<p>And the horses are interesting animals.</p>
<p>They do tell you a lot.</p>
<p>The horse does the double inhale-long exhale often.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bit of a stressy guy.</p>
<p>Do you suppose this physiological stress</p>
<p>regularly transcends?</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>In fact, I mentioned warm bloods, right?</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Her name is Sue McConnell,</p>
<p>and she is an expert in dog genetics.</p>
<p>So you can imagine I&rsquo;m always asking her questions.</p>
<p>And we talk about dogs and we talk about horses</p>
<p>because she also, I think she raises warm bloods.</p>
<p>And you hear about hot bloods and warm bloods.</p>
<p>And you also, if you have any familiarity with dogs,</p>
<p>there are dogs like Costello,</p>
<p>where like a nuclear bomb could go off</p>
<p>and Costello might open an eye.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bulldog.</p>
<p>Economy of effort.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to get activated</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a reason to do it.</p>
<p>They are very, as we call, parasympathetic dominant.</p>
<p>That seesaw of autonomic arousal</p>
<p>is just really, really relaxed.</p>
<p>Getting them into action is more of an effort.</p>
<p>There are other animals, like the whippet, right?</p>
<p>Or the Italian greyhound.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re always cold.</p>
<p>That are very sympathetic dominant.</p>
<p>And then of course, within a breed or within a species,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a range.</p>
<p>And humans also out within a range.</p>
<p>I think anyone who&rsquo;s had children will tell you,</p>
<p>you know, he or she has been like this since birth.</p>
<p>Calm, easygoing, or like really easily stressed.</p>
<p>I think that seesaw, we didn&rsquo;t get into tonight too much,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a concept with the autonomic regulation</p>
<p>of a hinge.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t think so much about being really stressed out</p>
<p>or really relaxed, but certain animals,</p>
<p>the hinge is tightened so that the seesaw</p>
<p>just kind of tilts mellow, like Costello.</p>
<p>A bulldog almost seems like a different animal</p>
<p>than a whippet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so very different.</p>
<p>And within the category of horses,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not an expert in horse genetics,</p>
<p>but they are selected for,</p>
<p>not just for their physical attributes,</p>
<p>but for their psychological or temperament attributes.</p>
<p>And you see this in dogs too.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason I picked Costello,</p>
<p>and Elvis can verify this story,</p>
<p>is I read, I wanted a dog for so many years.</p>
<p>And I went there and there were all these puppies.</p>
<p>And I was like, I heard you need to take them</p>
<p>in the other room, one by one.</p>
<p>And then if it barks for its siblings,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, it&rsquo;s a healthy puppy.</p>
<p>So I walk in and all the dogs are running around like crazy.</p>
<p>It was right around Christmas time, right Elvis?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re running around,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s one in the back.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s taking advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that all the other ones are waiting,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just eating out of all of their bowls.</p>
<p>And I was like, I want that one.</p>
<p>So I took that chubby little bastard in the next room,</p>
<p>and I thought, okay, he&rsquo;s gonna bark for his siblings.</p>
<p>And he laid down and he took a nap.</p>
<p>And I was like, this one, I want this one.</p>
<p>Why did I want that one?</p>
<p>Well, this completes the principle,</p>
<p>which is I wanted a dog like that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not like that.</p>
<p>And I was very interested in a dog I could take care of,</p>
<p>but also a dog that would help regulate my nervous system.</p>
<p>And so for me, having a dog like that</p>
<p>as opposed to a Whippet or something</p>
<p>that was constantly around, it&rsquo;s a very calming effect.</p>
<p>And to this day, memory of his snoring</p>
<p>still puts me to sleep.</p>
<p>So I think that your horse probably has,</p>
<p>it kind of idles a little bit higher.</p>
<p>Think about the RPM, revs a little bit higher</p>
<p>at a given speed, higher, more RPM at a given speed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I think about the autonomic system.</p>
<p>How do you reset that?</p>
<p>Well, this is why a lot of exercise is good, right?</p>
<p>Incidentally, my girlfriend&rsquo;s horse was crazy.</p>
<p>It was gelded late and it was crazy.</p>
<p>I almost said nuts, but that&rsquo;s like a bad pun.</p>
<p>So, all right.</p>
<p>It was not nuts, but it was crazy.</p>
<p>It was gelded late.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is there any science behind staying motivated</p>
<p>or developing discipline?</p>
<p>Ooh, so this represents kind of the higher tier</p>
<p>of where I think things are gonna go in the next few years</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going to start seeing this</p>
<p>convergence of psychology and biology</p>
<p>where we can get to these harder concepts.</p>
<p>I like to think that we can stay motivated</p>
<p>through a simple process that now will make sense to you</p>
<p>because the last thing I covered was</p>
<p>toggling back and forth between our ability</p>
<p>to be gritty and lean in, kind of in friction,</p>
<p>maybe even a little anger, fear, competitiveness, et cetera,</p>
<p>that kind of grinding in, but that the more sustaining fuel,</p>
<p>the sort of hybrid version, right?</p>
<p>Hybrid fuel model would be one in which you can access that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a depletable and not so renewable resource</p>
<p>without a lot of rest.</p>
<p>Meaning working hard out of anger, determination,</p>
<p>and kind of grit will work, but when you are depleted,</p>
<p>you have to stop for a long while.</p>
<p>Whereas if you can access this delight system,</p>
<p>which is really one of dopamine and serotonin both,</p>
<p>in other words, and I wanna think of a,</p>
<p>not of a different way to put this,</p>
<p>but to try and think about what sorts of things</p>
<p>and tools allow you to be and feel most loving,</p>
<p>I know it sounds weak, but it&rsquo;s anything but weak,</p>
<p>to be most loving in the verb sense of the word</p>
<p>toward what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I actually used to use this trick in college</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;d encounter a topic I hated.</p>
<p>I would tell myself, I&rsquo;m really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna fall in love with this</p>
<p>by trying to find the gems within it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but the wish to do it that way as opposed to,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna grind this out,</p>
<p>at least for me at the time, was a powerful tool.</p>
<p>So motivation and discipline is a tricky one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the just do it thing.</p>
<p>You need tools to modulate your stress</p>
<p>and to get your sleep, do all the basic things right,</p>
<p>set the right context for you to be in your best chance</p>
<p>of being disciplined,</p>
<p>and that itself is its own form of discipline.</p>
<p>But in terms of continual motivation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna manage to go against the grain</p>
<p>for very long.</p>
<p>People have managed to go against challenge</p>
<p>for very long time, for very long times.</p>
<p>In fact, I was reading recently about the psychology</p>
<p>of people being kidnapped,</p>
<p>and they have this odd trick that they use.</p>
<p>Have you heard about this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like Stockholm syndrome,</p>
<p>but they actually convince themselves</p>
<p>to fall in love with their captors,</p>
<p>and then they come up with new ways to escape them,</p>
<p>which is kind of cool.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about mentally feeling</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re trying to go from back on your heels</p>
<p>to flat-footed that&rsquo;s very energetically costly.</p>
<p>So again, these systems are very susceptible</p>
<p>to what we call context or top-down regulation.</p>
<p>Hopefully that helps.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a little bit abstract.</p>
<p>I wish I could give you a one-minute exercise</p>
<p>that would make you motivated,</p>
<p>but we do talk about tools to get adrenaline going</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But spend some time thinking about what would allow you</p>
<p>to sustain effort through positive feelings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a light concept at all.</p>
<p>Okay, next question, please.</p>
<p>What would be your biggest piece of advice</p>
<p>for achieving one&rsquo;s dreams?</p>
<p>Oy, that&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>
<p>Again, this is gonna be a little abstract.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a believer in this idea</p>
<p>of kind of a seed message.</p>
<p>Robert Green has talked a lot about this,</p>
<p>that we can all kind of think back to a event</p>
<p>or stage of our life.</p>
<p>Typically it&rsquo;s before puberty,</p>
<p>for other reasons that are kind of interesting,</p>
<p>but where we delight in something, right?</p>
<p>So for me it was fish.</p>
<p>And obviously now I don&rsquo;t need to work on fish.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t about the fish.</p>
<p>I hope that came through.</p>
<p>I mean, aquaria are really cool,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not about the fish.</p>
<p>It was something about the way they moved.</p>
<p>It was something about the way</p>
<p>that it tickled my excitement.</p>
<p>I used to get dropped off at this little pet shop</p>
<p>in California Avenue in Palo Alto called Moni&rsquo;s Pet Shop.</p>
<p>My mom used it as childcare.</p>
<p>She would drop me off there and I had this book</p>
<p>and I would log all the tropical fish</p>
<p>and which ones could be with which ones.</p>
<p>And then I was obsessed, right?</p>
<p>But for me, it was something about organizing</p>
<p>and being able to make reliable predictions.</p>
<p>It was about parsimony.</p>
<p>It was about principles as opposed to,</p>
<p>and the colors delighted me and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>The equipment delighted me, but then I had puberty</p>
<p>and then like it was something else.</p>
<p>And then I went to college and it was something else</p>
<p>and I got a girlfriend and it was something else.</p>
<p>So it changes over time,</p>
<p>but this is why I recommended</p>
<p>to that young 15 year old person</p>
<p>that they learn to tap into that sense of like,</p>
<p>oh, like this is cool.</p>
<p>Like this feels cool.</p>
<p>I know not everyone else thinks it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Maybe they do.</p>
<p>Like this feels good.</p>
<p>I actually have a somatic experience of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a very somatically oriented person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more up here, but I actually know</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m on to something,</p>
<p>if this left arm just kind of starts fidgeting,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like I want to move or like some people,</p>
<p>you can start to identify ways</p>
<p>in which you suddenly have this positive energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fear energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a magnetism to things.</p>
<p>And just don&rsquo;t be confused or misdirected</p>
<p>in thinking that it&rsquo;s that thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, again, energy or that attraction</p>
<p>to something that feels right,</p>
<p>that is your, you know,</p>
<p>I wish we had these divining rod to find water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like antennae.</p>
<p>You want to grow your antennae.</p>
<p>So how do you follow your dreams?</p>
<p>Well, I never thought I&rsquo;d do a podcast.</p>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d become a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>You have to be willing, of course,</p>
<p>to take risks and to iterate quickly,</p>
<p>but not so quickly that you, you know,</p>
<p>you fail out of the game, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you do get back in, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really about developing an awareness.</p>
<p>Now, the key thing is you&rsquo;re not going to find this</p>
<p>by going up a mountain and sitting there</p>
<p>or waiting for your passion to just kind of rocket,</p>
<p>you know, does this sort of piano fall onto your head?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen that way.</p>
<p>You have to interact with the sensory world</p>
<p>and different kinds of people.</p>
<p>And you have to be a little bit of a adventurer</p>
<p>in a safe way, of course,</p>
<p>an adventurer and learn to recognize the signals.</p>
<p>And some people are very in tune with this.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s an amazing podcast</p>
<p>with Rick Rubin recently on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>where he talks about the creative processes,</p>
<p>kind of this, like, it seems like whatever&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in that beard of his is just connects to the world</p>
<p>and he can just like, there,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s where you need to go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, but that&rsquo;s part of the magic</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s all energetic, it&rsquo;s all energetic.</p>
<p>And when I say energetic,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean in the mystical sense.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to learn to sense</p>
<p>those fluctuations in energy.</p>
<p>Some people can sense them very easily</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very mellow.</p>
<p>And if something gets them really excited,</p>
<p>they notice as a big Delta, as we say in science,</p>
<p>big change.</p>
<p>Other people, they ride kind of high all the time.</p>
<p>And so everything&rsquo;s exciting to them.</p>
<p>And they miss a lot of the subtle fluctuations</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s really special and right for them.</p>
<p>In fact, mania is characterized</p>
<p>by hyper elevated levels of dopamine</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s a good idea, right?</p>
<p>And depression is the opposite.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s gonna work, right?</p>
<p>And those are the extremes</p>
<p>and those are rough conditions, obviously.</p>
<p>But for most people, it&rsquo;s about learning</p>
<p>to detect those subtle fluctuations.</p>
<p>And every time, every single time you find somebody</p>
<p>who is exceptional at their craft</p>
<p>and doing well in life, okay?</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who are exceptional</p>
<p>at their craft, but not necessarily doing well on the whole.</p>
<p>Those people have a kind of intuition</p>
<p>about what feels good to them.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize winner in chemistry</p>
<p>is my colleague, Carolyn Bertozzi.</p>
<p>And all I know of her,</p>
<p>except the fact that she&rsquo;s an amazing chemist,</p>
<p>is they did this interview with her.</p>
<p>And she said that when everyone would go out in college,</p>
<p>she was finding excuses to stay home</p>
<p>and read organic chemistry.</p>
<p>Now that, to me, sounds like a bad night.</p>
<p>But for her, it was pure delight.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s wired for that.</p>
<p>And I think her work is gonna be vitally important</p>
<p>and transformative for humanity, I really do.</p>
<p>So how do you succeed in chasing your dreams?</p>
<p>You succeed in identifying what they are,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know at the outset.</p>
<p>You wanna find the energy to find the right path</p>
<p>and continually course correct</p>
<p>when you will undoubtedly be off your path.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>I still look for the feeling of delighting</p>
<p>in Costello or the cuttlefish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a template I have to match,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my like, oh yeah, I know what that feels like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a texture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you think about a bunch</p>
<p>of different textures of sandpaper,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this one that just feels really good.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re comparing everything to that.</p>
<p>Because the system that involves all these chemicals,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find it if you learn to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t find it sitting,</p>
<p>staring at your belly button or going up a mountain.</p>
<p>You have to be in sensory experience in order to find it.</p>
<p>Reflection is good, but you need to get into action.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wow, all right, well, okay.</p>
<p>So psilocybin, opinion of the psychedelics generally.</p>
<p>We just had an episode with my colleague, Nolan Williams,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a triple board certified neurologist, psychiatrist.</p>
<p>This is a fun thing about working at Stanford.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very humbling because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, who are these people?</p>
<p>Got three board certifications.</p>
<p>You know, the psilocybin, first of all, not for everybody.</p>
<p>People with psychosis, it is still illegal,</p>
<p>decriminalized certain places.</p>
<p>So obviously the cautionary notes,</p>
<p>people who have drug addiction issues</p>
<p>or other kinds of addiction issues need to be thoughtful</p>
<p>about diving into a neurochemical landscape like that.</p>
<p>But it does appear that the clinical trials</p>
<p>on one macro dose, this is what&rsquo;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about microdosing psilocybin,</p>
<p>but the data, at least according to Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>who was also on the podcast,</p>
<p>the data for microdosing are not really there, frankly.</p>
<p>The data on single session macro dose,</p>
<p>the sort of heroic doses that have been talked about</p>
<p>in the psychonaut community for depression</p>
<p>and to some extent PTSD and for eating disorders</p>
<p>and sort of end of life preparation are quite encouraging.</p>
<p>In fact, the current data suggests that about 2 3rds</p>
<p>of people achieve lasting relief from one session.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind, those are guided sessions</p>
<p>with physicians in the room, et cetera.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a potential hazard of all psychedelics,</p>
<p>which is they alter, this includes MDMA or especially MDMA,</p>
<p>they alter the chemical landscape in you</p>
<p>such that a lot of things can serve as attractors</p>
<p>in that state, meaning you can get really</p>
<p>into the sound of music in an MDMA session,</p>
<p>feel connected to that and waste the opportunity</p>
<p>for some more meaningful transformative rewiring.</p>
<p>And I do think that that&rsquo;s worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the usefulness of having a therapeutic guide</p>
<p>there is they can continually steer you back</p>
<p>to what at least for you is the more meaningful work.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very encouraging and Nolan Williams,</p>
<p>who I trust is again, triple board certified MD,</p>
<p>said that in the studies of lifetime perceived individual</p>
<p>and societal risk of all the compounds out there,</p>
<p>except for caffeine, psilocybin is at the bottom of the list</p>
<p>whereas things like heroin, cocaine, alcohol,</p>
<p>methamphetamine sit at the top of the list,</p>
<p>actually alcohol quite high on that list</p>
<p>at certain amounts of consumption.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the landscape of psilocybin,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not so excited about the micro dosing data,</p>
<p>very excited about the single heroic dose data.</p>
<p>One interesting thing there perhaps,</p>
<p>what seems to be the unifying feature</p>
<p>of a successful psilocybin session</p>
<p>is that at some point the person feels</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s like too much of an autonomic thing,</p>
<p>they kind of get to this point</p>
<p>and then they are encouraged to quote unquote, let go.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fascinated by this concept of letting go</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what that means,</p>
<p>but it seems like being able to ride the wave</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal from top to bottom</p>
<p>seems to be very powerful</p>
<p>for trauma and depression treatment.</p>
<p>And this is interesting,</p>
<p>a lot of people think that one of the major issues</p>
<p>in humans nowadays is we&rsquo;re stressed about a lot of things,</p>
<p>but we never actually get to go</p>
<p>into the full stress response and then let it relax again.</p>
<p>And catharsis was big at one point,</p>
<p>scream therapy, Steve Jobs is really into scream therapies.</p>
<p>Whether or not catharsis is healthy or not</p>
<p>has been debated,</p>
<p>but the data are kind of pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that it may be provided that the catharsis</p>
<p>is not obviously someone damaging themself or somebody else.</p>
<p>So maybe we should all be screaming a lot more.</p>
<p>Why does my desire to eat disappear after I use the sauna?</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>I can go in hungry and get out with no desire to eat.</p>
<p>I can only speculate.</p>
<p>You know, the sauna or any kind of deliberate heat exposure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uncomfortable releases this molecule dynorphin.</p>
<p>This is actually the same molecule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released under conditions of alcohol withdrawal,</p>
<p>makes you feel agitated and not good.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this rebound.</p>
<p>The way it feels good is later,</p>
<p>it causes this up-regulation</p>
<p>in the so-called mu-opioid receptors.</p>
<p>So the chemicals that you have,</p>
<p>your so-called endogenous opioids,</p>
<p>not the opioids that are related to the opioid crisis,</p>
<p>but the ones that you naturally make</p>
<p>are able to have a more robust effect after the sauna.</p>
<p>Dynorphin is an appetite suppressant</p>
<p>and for reasons related to kind of general discomfort</p>
<p>in the body.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only reason I can speculate.</p>
<p>There are a number of other things that sauna does,</p>
<p>including massive increases in growth hormone,</p>
<p>provided you don&rsquo;t sauna too much.</p>
<p>So if you do it once a week for four 20-minute sessions,</p>
<p>spaced five minutes apart,</p>
<p>you get these enormous increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>If you start doing it more often,</p>
<p>you get still significant,</p>
<p>but smaller increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>And my team, this is how the podcast goes too.</p>
<p>At some point, Rob just goes, it&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>So if you think that the episodes are long now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be a lot longer.</p>
<p>Listen, I just want to, before we part,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a Sunday night and people have to go.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight.</p>
<p>I know that, at least for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still sort of baffled, but pleasantly so,</p>
<p>that people are interested in investing time</p>
<p>to come out and hear hours of a nerd like me</p>
<p>talk about science and tools.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m delighted that people</p>
<p>are hopefully gleaning some useful information.</p>
<p>Please do pass along the information.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t invent this stuff.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I was not consulted at the design phase.</p>
<p>I have no domain over it.</p>
<p>This is the stuff of mother nature</p>
<p>and whatever other beliefs you have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re here in us.</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t finish by saying,</p>
<p>have a wonderful night</p>
<p>and thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
