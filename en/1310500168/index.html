    <p>The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a neuroscientist at Stanford,</p>
<p>a world class researcher and educator,</p>
<p>and now he has a new podcast on YouTube</p>
<p>and all the usual places called Huberman Lab</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t recommend highly enough.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Masterclass Online Courses for Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,</p>
<p>Magic Spoon Low Carb Cereal,</p>
<p>and BetterHelp Online Therapy.</p>
<p>Click the sponsor links to get a discount.</p>
<p>By the way, Masterclass is testing to see</p>
<p>if they want to support this podcast long term.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on the fence, now is the time to sign up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure Andrew will have</p>
<p>a neuroscience masterclass on there soon enough,</p>
<p>though his podcast is basically</p>
<p>a weekly masterclass in itself.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Andrew is a friend</p>
<p>and a new collaborator.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on a paper together</p>
<p>about a topic we&rsquo;re both really passionate about.</p>
<p>At the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s probably many months away from being published.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m really excited about this work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the smartest and kindest people</p>
<p>I have the pleasure of talking to on this podcast,</p>
<p>so I hope we&rsquo;ll talk many more times in the future.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it on our podcast, follow on Spotify,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon, or connect with me</p>
<p>on Twitter at Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>Why do humans need sleep?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go with a big first question.</p>
<p>Okay, well, the answer I&rsquo;ll start with</p>
<p>is the one that I always default to</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a why question,</p>
<p>which is I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase.</p>
<p>So I wriggle my way out of giving a absolute answer, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one mechanism that&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super important,</p>
<p>which is that the longer we are awake,</p>
<p>the more adenosine accumulates in our brain.</p>
<p>And adenosine binds to adenosine receptors,</p>
<p>no surprise there,</p>
<p>and it creates the feeling of sleepiness</p>
<p>independent of time of day or night.</p>
<p>So there are two mechanisms.</p>
<p>One is we get sleepy as adenosine accumulates.</p>
<p>The longer we&rsquo;ve been awake,</p>
<p>the more adenosine has accumulated in our system.</p>
<p>But how sleepy we get for a given amount of adenosine</p>
<p>depends on where we are in this so called circadian cycle.</p>
<p>And the circadian cycle</p>
<p>is just this very, very well conserved oscillation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a temperature oscillation</p>
<p>where you go from a low point.</p>
<p>Typically, if you&rsquo;re awake during the day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re asleep at night,</p>
<p>your lowest temperature point will be like 3 a.m., 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>and then your temperature will start to creep up</p>
<p>as you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll peak in the late afternoon,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll start to drop again toward the evening,</p>
<p>and then you get sleep again.</p>
<p>That oscillation in temperature takes 24 hours.</p>
<p>Plus or minus.</p>
<p>Plus your temperature.</p>
<p>Yeah, plus or minus an hour.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>even though I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>I do not think it&rsquo;s a coincidence</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s aligned to the 24 hour spin of the Earth</p>
<p>on its axis.</p>
<p>The fact that we tend to be bathed in sunlight</p>
<p>for a portion of that spin,</p>
<p>and in darkness for the other portion of that spin.</p>
<p>So there are two mechanisms,</p>
<p>the adenosine accumulation and the circadian time point</p>
<p>that we happen to be at.</p>
<p>And those converge to create a sense</p>
<p>of sleepiness, awakefulness.</p>
<p>The simple way to reveal these two mechanisms,</p>
<p>to uncouple them, is stay up for 24 hours,</p>
<p>and you will find that even though you&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you stay up midnight, 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re on a regular schedule,</p>
<p>like that I follow, not like the kind that you follow,</p>
<p>I will get very sleepy around 3, 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>which is my normal wake up time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start to feel more alert,</p>
<p>even though adenosine has been accumulating further.</p>
<p>So adenosine is higher for me the longer I stay up,</p>
<p>and yet I feel more alert than I did a few hours ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because these are two interacting forces.</p>
<p>So adenosine makes you sleepy,</p>
<p>and then just how sleepy or how awake you feel</p>
<p>also depends on where you are</p>
<p>in this temperature oscillation that takes 24 hours.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of oscillations going on,</p>
<p>and then they kind of, through the evolutionary process,</p>
<p>have evolved to all be aligned somewhat,</p>
<p>and they interplay.</p>
<p>So you said your body temperature goes up and down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s chemicals in your brain that oscillate,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the actual oscillation</p>
<p>of the sun in the sky.</p>
<p>So all of that together has some impact on each other,</p>
<p>and somehow that all results in us</p>
<p>wanting to go to sleep every night.</p>
<p>Right, so, and we can get right into the meat of this,</p>
<p>so I guess we just dove right in,</p>
<p>but the temperature oscillation</p>
<p>is the effector of the circadian clock.</p>
<p>So every cell in our body has a 24 hour rhythm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dictated by genes like clock, purr, BMAL.</p>
<p>This is one of the great successes of biology.</p>
<p>They give a Nobel prize to Rappert,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Rappert got it, forgive me,</p>
<p>but sorry if you got it, Steve, congratulations.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t on the committee.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, did beautiful work, Steve Rappert and others,</p>
<p>but Mike Roshbosh and other people worked out</p>
<p>these mechanisms in flies and bacteria and mammals.</p>
<p>There are these genes that create 24 hour oscillations</p>
<p>in gene expression, et cetera, in every cell of our body.</p>
<p>But what aligns those is a signal</p>
<p>from the master circadian clock,</p>
<p>which sits right above the roof of the mouth,</p>
<p>called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.</p>
<p>And that clock synchronizes all the clocks of the body</p>
<p>to this general temperature rhythm</p>
<p>by way of controlling systemic temperature,</p>
<p>which makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>If you want to create a general oscillation</p>
<p>in all the tissues and organs of the body, use temperature.</p>
<p>And so that work on temperature,</p>
<p>if people want to explore it further,</p>
<p>was Joe Takahashi, who was at Northwestern,</p>
<p>now at UT Southwestern in Dallas.</p>
<p>And it is absolutely clear that humans do better</p>
<p>on a diurnal schedule, sorry, Lex,</p>
<p>than a nocturnal schedule, because you could say,</p>
<p>well, provided I sleep and push adenosine back downhill,</p>
<p>which is what happens when we sleep,</p>
<p>adenosine is then reduced.</p>
<p>And provided I am on more or less a 24 hour schedule,</p>
<p>why should it matter that I&rsquo;m awake when the sun&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m asleep when the sun is down?</p>
<p>But it turns out that if you look at health metrics,</p>
<p>people that are strictly nocturnal do far worse</p>
<p>on immune function, on metabolic function, et cetera,</p>
<p>than people who are diurnal,</p>
<p>who are awake during the daytime.</p>
<p>And animals that are nocturnal, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>And animals that are so called crepuscular,</p>
<p>which tend to be active at dawn and at dusk,</p>
<p>this is a beautiful system, I won&rsquo;t go down that rabbit hole,</p>
<p>but these are animals whose visual systems operate best.</p>
<p>They tend to be predators like mountain lions.</p>
<p>They have optimized their waking times</p>
<p>for the times when the animals they eat</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t see well in those light conditions.</p>
<p>But given the rod cone ratios in their eyes,</p>
<p>that the mountain lion is picking off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you see a special forces</p>
<p>and they are looking through night vision goggles</p>
<p>and they have a clear advantage, right?</p>
<p>They are seeing in the dark.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what it&rsquo;s like to be a mountain lion</p>
<p>as opposed to a bunny rabbit.</p>
<p>Would you say that a lot of these cycles evolved</p>
<p>in the predator prey relationships</p>
<p>of the different throughout the food chain?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically all somehow has to do with survival</p>
<p>in this complicated web of predators and prey.</p>
<p>Almost certainly, there had to have been a time</p>
<p>in which humans being awake and active at night,</p>
<p>as opposed to during the day,</p>
<p>led to higher levels of lethality.</p>
<p>And probably particular in kids,</p>
<p>you imagine kids running around in the dark</p>
<p>and getting that where there are a lot of animals</p>
<p>that can see really well under those conditions</p>
<p>and humans can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And this would be all preelectricity.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re carrying a torch,</p>
<p>I mean, the range of illumination on a torch</p>
<p>is nothing compared to what a nighttime predator,</p>
<p>like a large cat or something can do.</p>
<p>I mean, they basically, they can see everything they need to</p>
<p>in order to eat us and not the other way around.</p>
<p>So one fascinating thing you said</p>
<p>is that blew my mind and we went right past it,</p>
<p>which is the temperature is a really powerful,</p>
<p>like if you were to think about the ways</p>
<p>that different parts of the body,</p>
<p>different systems in the body</p>
<p>would communicate with each other,</p>
<p>temperature would be a really good one.</p>
<p>And that just, I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s obvious,</p>
<p>but it kind of blew my mind just now</p>
<p>that yeah, these systems are all distributed.</p>
<p>And they have to kind of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not actually sending signals,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re coordinating.</p>
<p>They need some sort of universal thing to look at</p>
<p>in order to coordinate.</p>
<p>And temperature is a nice one to build around.</p>
<p>And that way you could control the behavior</p>
<p>of all these different systems</p>
<p>by controlling the temperature.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s attractive to think of a mechanism</p>
<p>where this master circadian clock secretes a peptide</p>
<p>or something that goes and locks to receptors</p>
<p>in all the cells and gets it just right.</p>
<p>But that leaves far too much room for variability,</p>
<p>binding affinities, cells in a lot of parts of our body</p>
<p>are at different stages of maturation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re turning over liver cells and so forth.</p>
<p>And for instance, we have a clock in our gut</p>
<p>and in our liver such that if we were just take out</p>
<p>your liver and put it on a table</p>
<p>and just look at the expression of these genes,</p>
<p>it would be in a 24 hour oscillation on its own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s independent, but something has to entrain them</p>
<p>and keep them all synchronized.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not obvious that it would be temperature.</p>
<p>Takahashi&rsquo;s great gift to biology was to show</p>
<p>that all the stuff coming out of this master circadian clock</p>
<p>at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s a weird statement,</p>
<p>no pun intended, at the end of the day and the night,</p>
<p>at the end of the story, it all boils down to making sure</p>
<p>that the temperature of tissues oscillates</p>
<p>in the same fashion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s blowing my mind and thinking like</p>
<p>what other mechanism could possibly exist</p>
<p>to create that kind of oscillation.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re Russian, it&rsquo;s cold in Russia</p>
<p>for a lot of the year.</p>
<p>The hibernation signal in certain animals</p>
<p>is a remarkable signal.</p>
<p>There are peptides secreted from this very same clock</p>
<p>that in animals like ground squirrels or bears,</p>
<p>they go into a kind of a torpor</p>
<p>where everything, reproduction, metabolism,</p>
<p>everything is reduced while they&rsquo;re in their cave.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually stay asleep all of winter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a myth.</p>
<p>And they actually do these very dramatic</p>
<p>and periodic arousals from hibernation</p>
<p>where they just shake and shake and shake.</p>
<p>It looks like a seizure.</p>
<p>And then they go back under into the torpor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from a peptide that&rsquo;s released.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s about shutting down the whole system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that having these very regular oscillations</p>
<p>every 24 hours is essential for everything</p>
<p>from metabolism to reproduction.</p>
<p>Is there an optimal temperature for sleep</p>
<p>that I should mention?</p>
<p>I think your latest episode,</p>
<p>you and people should go check out</p>
<p>helixsleep.com slash Huberman to support Andrew.</p>
<p>Thanks for the plug.</p>
<p>I mean, the amazing thing about this stuff</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re creating,</p>
<p>oh, and yes, you have a new podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>In this past month, you did a whole series on sleep,</p>
<p>which people should definitely check out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some podcasts that come out</p>
<p>that just make me want to be a better human being</p>
<p>by just the quality.</p>
<p>Three Blue One Brown, Grant Sanderson is like that for me.</p>
<p>Just like, wow, this is education is best.</p>
<p>So Andrew symbolizes that, captures that brilliantly.</p>
<p>So go support the sponsor</p>
<p>so he doesn&rsquo;t stop doing the thing.</p>
<p>So I think they have a cooling pad too.</p>
<p>So the 8 Sleep Mattress sponsors me.</p>
<p>They sent me a mattress and it&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, listen, I used to sleep on the floor.</p>
<p>Sleep where you fall.</p>
<p>Sleep where I fall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>But so like, I would have never bought a nice mattress</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, why?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>This is a floor, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But it was a game changer to be able to control temperature.</p>
<p>Like for me, it&rsquo;s cooling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the hell it is.</p>
<p>Well, you want the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>and rest of the body needs to drop</p>
<p>by about anywhere from two to three degrees</p>
<p>in order to get into your deepest sleep</p>
<p>and transition to sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really going to help.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be cold that you&rsquo;re bothered</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t fall asleep.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why some people like it really cold in the room</p>
<p>and under a warm blanket or with socks on,</p>
<p>for some people that can be good</p>
<p>because this temperature oscillation is such</p>
<p>that as your temperature is dropping,</p>
<p>that correlates generally with the most sleepy phase</p>
<p>of your circadian cycle.</p>
<p>So cool is better for falling and staying asleep</p>
<p>and sleeping deeply.</p>
<p>And then I guess like that&rsquo;s what 8 Sleep showed.</p>
<p>They have like an app is it warms back up to wake you up.</p>
<p>The idea that I haven&rsquo;t actually used it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is stupid.</p>
<p>People say it works,</p>
<p>but I just keep it the same temperature throughout the night</p>
<p>but warming it up, I guess wakes you up,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, because the wake up signal is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting to think about it&rsquo;s not just correlated</p>
<p>with an increase in body temperature.</p>
<p>The increase in body temperature</p>
<p>is triggering the release of cortisol from your adrenals.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the wake up signal.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s absolute temperatures we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>or is it just even relative?</p>
<p>Just even just the decrease.</p>
<p>Well, everyone&rsquo;s gonna have</p>
<p>slightly different basal temperature.</p>
<p>The idea that everybody should be 98.6.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a myth.</p>
<p>And there are theories that body temperature overall</p>
<p>has been dropping in the last 50 years or so.</p>
<p>I doubt that&rsquo;s true for somebody who is athletic like you</p>
<p>and is young and healthy.</p>
<p>But basically the coldest period of that 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>is when you are going to be sleepiest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a period within that 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a time point called your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>And your temperature minimum tends to be about two hours</p>
<p>before your typical wake up time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the wake up time</p>
<p>in the middle of the night where you go use the bathroom</p>
<p>or where you set an alarm to go catch a flight.</p>
<p>I mean, if you were to just allow yourself</p>
<p>to sleep without a clock for a few days,</p>
<p>measure when you typically wake up,</p>
<p>two hours before then is your temperature minimum.</p>
<p>And that temperature minimum turns out to be</p>
<p>a very important landmark in your circadian cycle</p>
<p>because it turns out that if you get bright light</p>
<p>in your eyes in the hours immediately</p>
<p>before your temperature minimum,</p>
<p>so two to four hours or anytime within the two</p>
<p>or four hour window before that temperature minimum,</p>
<p>you are going to what&rsquo;s called delay your circadian clock.</p>
<p>The next day, that whole oscillation</p>
<p>is going to move forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later.</p>
<p>Whereas if you get bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>in the hours after that temperature minimum,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say for me, typical wake up time is 6 a.m.,</p>
<p>my temperature minimum somewhere around 4 a.m.</p>
<p>If I get bright light in my eyes, 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to advance that oscillation</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;ll want to go to bed earlier</p>
<p>and wake up earlier the subsequent nights.</p>
<p>So you might say, wait, but most nights</p>
<p>I go to sleep and wake up at more or less the same time.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the same thing</p>
<p>is happening on both sides.</p>
<p>You are both advancing your clock a little bit</p>
<p>and assuming that you&rsquo;re looking at light in the evening,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also delaying your clock a little bit.</p>
<p>So you get kind of captured in between</p>
<p>and then your rhythm more or less oscillates</p>
<p>at the same period, as we say, as the spin of the earth.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re like you where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I get text messages from you sometimes at odd hours</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re on the East Coast,</p>
<p>then I know that you had to have been pulling</p>
<p>basically an all nighter.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s the interesting point</p>
<p>about the messiness of sleep.</p>
<p>So most people seem to perform the best</p>
<p>when they have like a regular sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I perhaps am the same, but I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>And I tend to believe that you can also perform</p>
<p>relatively optimally with chaos of sleep,</p>
<p>of like a weird soup of like power naps</p>
<p>and all nighters and all of that,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re like happy doing what you love.</p>
<p>And maybe you can tell me what you think about this.</p>
<p>So I tend to, for myself, try to minimize stress in life.</p>
<p>So what I found for myself with diet,</p>
<p>with sleep is that if I obsess about it being perfect,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll actually stress quite a bit when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll feel shitty when I don&rsquo;t get enough sleep</p>
<p>because I know I should be getting more sleep</p>
<p>as opposed to the actual physiological effects</p>
<p>of not getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>I find if I just accept whatever the hell happens,</p>
<p>happens and smile and just take it all in,</p>
<p>like David Goggins style, like if it sucks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even better or what is it,</p>
<p>Jocko&rsquo;s like good or whatever he says.</p>
<p>I think there are several things</p>
<p>that you said that are important,</p>
<p>but I agree that one can have a dysregulated sleep schedule</p>
<p>and still be a happy person and productive.</p>
<p>Much of my life, I&rsquo;ve pulled all nighters</p>
<p>and slept weird schedules.</p>
<p>I think many people can probably relate to going to sleep,</p>
<p>waking up four hours later, being up for an hour or two</p>
<p>on your computer, then going back to sleep</p>
<p>and getting amazing sleep the next day functioning.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that people have highlighted</p>
<p>the importance of sleep and getting enough rest.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s gone too far</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m editorializing a little bit,</p>
<p>but I think that we&rsquo;ve created this anxiety about sleep</p>
<p>that if we don&rsquo;t sleep enough, we&rsquo;re going to get dementia.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t get sleep,</p>
<p>then the reproductive access is going to completely crash.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of evidence to the contrary and as well,</p>
<p>just based on personal experience</p>
<p>and based on the fact that sure,</p>
<p>it may be that a solid eight hours</p>
<p>with no interruptions in there or nine or 10</p>
<p>could do great benefit,</p>
<p>but you can do really well if you do what you say,</p>
<p>which is you wake up,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to start stressing about it,</p>
<p>creating this meta stress about sleep.</p>
<p>Being happy is actually one of the most powerful things</p>
<p>that you can do,</p>
<p>allowing yourself to go down that rabbit hole of stress</p>
<p>for the following reason.</p>
<p>A lot of our fatigue is not due just to the buildup</p>
<p>of adenosine or time of day,</p>
<p>the circadian thing we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>An additional factor is that effort is related</p>
<p>to the release of epinephrine,</p>
<p>of adrenaline in our brain and body.</p>
<p>At some point, those levels get so high</p>
<p>that we get stressed mentally,</p>
<p>we get stressed physically and we want to give up.</p>
<p>There are good data published in Cell</p>
<p>showing that that signal, the epinephrine signal,</p>
<p>eventually accumulates and there&rsquo;s a quit point.</p>
<p>Dopamine, the molecule of pursuit and reward</p>
<p>and feeling good, resets our ability to be in effort.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of people don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but dopamine is actually what epinephrine is made from.</p>
<p>If you look at the biochemical cascade,</p>
<p>it starts with tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is found in red meats and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And tyrosine is eventually converted</p>
<p>through things like L dopa into dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is made into epinephrine.</p>
<p>So, I mean, this sounds kind of new agey,</p>
<p>but happiness, joy and pleasure in what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>creates a chemical milieu that provides more</p>
<p>of the chemicals that allow for effort.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing new agey about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in every biochemistry textbook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in every decent neuroscience textbook.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t talk about the happiness part.</p>
<p>They just talk about the dopamine part.</p>
<p>So, I think that limiting your stress</p>
<p>and at least recognizing, okay,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re pulling an all nighter</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re somehow on messed up sleep,</p>
<p>that there is going to be a point in that 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>where your brain is not trustworthy,</p>
<p>where your mental state is not worth placing too much weight</p>
<p>on because you are near that temperature minimum.</p>
<p>And near that temperature minimum,</p>
<p>which is correlates to that two hour,</p>
<p>about two hours before you would normally wake up,</p>
<p>the brain is hobbling along.</p>
<p>And anything you feel or think at that time</p>
<p>should not be given too much value.</p>
<p>But if you can trick yourself into thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the pleasure point,</p>
<p>you afford yourself a huge advantage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study done by a colleague of mine at Stanford</p>
<p>that showed that positive anticipation</p>
<p>about the next day events actually is a powerful metric</p>
<p>for creating quality sleep,</p>
<p>even if the sleep is very reduced.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll love this one.</p>
<p>And a lot of people are going to,</p>
<p>might be critical of this.</p>
<p>So, I just want to make sure that,</p>
<p>so this is work done out of Harvard Medical.</p>
<p>It was Bob Stickgold&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>and Emily Hoagland did this study that showed</p>
<p>looking at Ochem, performance on Ochem scores.</p>
<p>Okay, so organic chemistry at Harvard</p>
<p>is pretty tough subject, highly motivated,</p>
<p>a number of very good control groups in this study.</p>
<p>What she showed was that consistency of total sleep duration</p>
<p>was far more important for performance on these exams</p>
<p>than total sleep duration itself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that just getting more sleep</p>
<p>allows you to perform better.</p>
<p>Consistently getting about the same amount of sleep</p>
<p>is better for performance, at least on Ochem,</p>
<p>than just getting more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s referring to more</p>
<p>that there should be a consistent habit</p>
<p>versus the total amount.</p>
<p>To me, like the entirety of the picture of sleep</p>
<p>is similar to nutrition in that it feels like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many variables involved</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so person specific.</p>
<p>So, you know, a lot of studies,</p>
<p>I mean, this is the way of science,</p>
<p>has to look in aggregate the effects on sleep.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t focus on high performers</p>
<p>which are individuals ultimately.</p>
<p>Like the question isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a very important question,</p>
<p>is like what kind of diet fights obesity, reduces obesity?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another question,</p>
<p>what kind of diet allows David Goggins</p>
<p>to be the best version of himself?</p>
<p>So these high performers in different avenues.</p>
<p>And the same thing with sleep,</p>
<p>like people that tell me</p>
<p>that I should get eight hours of sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s, I mean, I get it</p>
<p>and there may be right, but they may be very wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that eight is better than six,</p>
<p>that you could very well do better on six than on eight.</p>
<p>There are a few other things that turn out to be</p>
<p>strong parameters for success in this domain.</p>
<p>For instance, your entire life, waking or asleep</p>
<p>is broken up into these 90 minute ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>If you look at ability to attend or do math problems</p>
<p>or do anything, you know, drive,</p>
<p>performance tends to ramp up slowly within a 90 minute cycle</p>
<p>peak and then come down at the end of that 90 minute cycle.</p>
<p>And in sleep, we go through these stage one, two, three,</p>
<p>four REM, et cetera, we&rsquo;ll talk more about that if you like,</p>
<p>those on 90 minute ultradian cycles as well.</p>
<p>Ending your sleep after a 90 minute cycle</p>
<p>at the near the end of a 90 minute cycle,</p>
<p>say at the end of six hours,</p>
<p>in many cases is better for you</p>
<p>than sleeping an additional hour, seven hours</p>
<p>and waking up in the middle of an ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>And there are a few apps that can measure this</p>
<p>based on body movements and things like that,</p>
<p>that have your alarm go off</p>
<p>at the end of an ultradian cycle.</p>
<p>And if you wake up in the middle of an ultradian cycle,</p>
<p>sometimes not always you can be very groggy</p>
<p>for a long period of time.</p>
<p>I certainly do better on six hours than I do on seven.</p>
<p>I happen to like an eight hour sleep, it feels great,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t slept an entire eight hours</p>
<p>without waking up in the middle of the night at some point</p>
<p>in, I don&rsquo;t know, forever.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember, it&rsquo;s probably some point in infancy.</p>
<p>And I function well during the day.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s an important parameter</p>
<p>is how do you feel during the day?</p>
<p>Almost everybody experiences some sort of dip in energy</p>
<p>in the late afternoon</p>
<p>or what would correlate to their temperature peak.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good time of day</p>
<p>to get either a 90 minute or less nap,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re not a napper or you can&rsquo;t nap,</p>
<p>feet elevated has been shown to be good for clear out</p>
<p>of some of this, the glymphatic system</p>
<p>is this kind of like sewer system of the brain</p>
<p>that you can clear stuff out.</p>
<p>So legs elevated, or one thing that I&rsquo;m a big proponent of</p>
<p>and that my lab has been studying</p>
<p>is what I now call NSDR, non sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>And this is just lying down.</p>
<p>There are some scripts that we&rsquo;re gonna put out there soon</p>
<p>as a free resource.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some hypnosis scripts</p>
<p>that my colleague David Spiegel has put out there</p>
<p>as a free resource,</p>
<p>but non sleep deep rest is allowing your system</p>
<p>to drop into states of a real calm</p>
<p>that allow you to get better at falling asleep later.</p>
<p>And they can be very restorative</p>
<p>for cognitive and motor function.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at least one study out of Denmark</p>
<p>that shows that the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>which is an area of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in motor planning and action,</p>
<p>one of these 20 minute non sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>resets levels of neuromodulators</p>
<p>like dopamine and the basal ganglia</p>
<p>to the same levels that they were</p>
<p>right after a long night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>So I also respectfully or semi respectfully disagree</p>
<p>with the idea that you can&rsquo;t recover lost sleep.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no IRS for sleep.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be in debt for sleep?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re falling asleep during the day and you&rsquo;re sleepy,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re falling asleep, that&rsquo;s a good sign of insomnia.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re not sleeping enough at night.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fatigued during the day,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not falling asleep,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re just exhausted,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not finding yourself falling asleep in meetings</p>
<p>and in conversation,</p>
<p>then chances are you&rsquo;re fatiguing your system</p>
<p>through something else,</p>
<p>like a long run in the middle of the night in Austin</p>
<p>or whatever it is that you&rsquo;re up to lately at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a magic to the nap.</p>
<p>And maybe you could speak to the,</p>
<p>because you mentioned these protocols</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t necessarily, so they&rsquo;re non sleep.</p>
<p>But to me, the nap one or two a day</p>
<p>can almost irrespective of how much sleep</p>
<p>I get the night before,</p>
<p>have a fundamental change in my mood, in my performance.</p>
<p>For the better or for the worse?</p>
<p>For the better, for the better.</p>
<p>Yeah, likewise.</p>
<p>So I do tend to kind of experiment with durations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s consistently surprising to me</p>
<p>how like a nap of like 10 minutes,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can speak</p>
<p>to the perfect duration of a nap,</p>
<p>but I find that it&rsquo;s like magic</p>
<p>that a short nap does as much good</p>
<p>and often better than a longer one, for me, for me,</p>
<p>subjectively speaking.</p>
<p>What would be a longer one?</p>
<p>Longer than 90 minutes?</p>
<p>No, no, like 90 minutes,</p>
<p>or a bit longer than 90 minutes, like two hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s starting to drop you into REM sleep.</p>
<p>And even if it&rsquo;s a tiny amount of REM sleep,</p>
<p>people can come out of those naps kind of disoriented.</p>
<p>I mean, remember, in sleep, space and time</p>
<p>are totally uncoupled.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an odd state to reenter the world in</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not gonna stay there for a while,</p>
<p>like for a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>I think a 20 minute nap is pretty fantastic.</p>
<p>Would you say that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>if you were to recommend to the general,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very weird to recommend anything</p>
<p>to the general populace,</p>
<p>because obviously it&rsquo;s very person specific,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s a good one will you say to friends?</p>
<p>Is 20 minutes a good powder?</p>
<p>20 or 30 minutes.</p>
<p>20 or 30 minutes,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going, unless you&rsquo;re sleep deprived,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to stay out of REM sleep,</p>
<p>rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sleep deprived, you&rsquo;ll drop right into it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever traveled and you&rsquo;re really jet lagged,</p>
<p>you go to the hotel, you lay down for one second,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a psychedelic dream,</p>
<p>which can be pretty great too.</p>
<p>But I think that 20, 30 minutes,</p>
<p>and if you can&rsquo;t sleep, some people have trouble napping,</p>
<p>then learning to relax the body</p>
<p>as much as possible,</p>
<p>like trying to remove all expression from your face,</p>
<p>completely letting your body kind of float.</p>
<p>If people have a hard time relaxing when they&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some terrific clinically</p>
<p>and research tested hypnosis protocols</p>
<p>that we could provide links to that are cost free</p>
<p>and that teach you how to just completely</p>
<p>release the alertness button and you just start drifting.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is if you don&rsquo;t have an alarm</p>
<p>or something to go off,</p>
<p>the other day I did one</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m almost embarrassed to say this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a component of it</p>
<p>where you actually are supposed to let your hand float up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a hypnosis script.</p>
<p>So they, it&rsquo;s my colleague, David Spiegel in the script,</p>
<p>he says, let your hand float up.</p>
<p>I woke up an hour later and my hand was still floating.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I was completely relaxed.</p>
<p>So hypnosis is just a matter of going deep relaxation,</p>
<p>narrowing of context, and it&rsquo;s all self imposed.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that hypnosis is like the stage thing</p>
<p>with the pendant and the chicken,</p>
<p>people fucking like chickens,</p>
<p>but real hypnosis is self hypnosis.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re learning to, it involves some shifts</p>
<p>in the way that you, the hypnotic induction involves</p>
<p>looking up, closing your eyes, slowly deep breath,</p>
<p>and then imagine yourself floating.</p>
<p>And people vary on a scale of about one to four,</p>
<p>four being the most easily hypnotized.</p>
<p>There are a few people who it&rsquo;s very hard for them</p>
<p>to allow themselves to go into these states,</p>
<p>but for most people, they just, they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice if you can have access to those states,</p>
<p>because when you come out of it, you feel amazing.</p>
<p>You feel like you slept the whole night,</p>
<p>at least most people report that.</p>
<p>So refresh, alert.</p>
<p>Ready to go.</p>
<p>I mean, basically you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know you have this interesting challenge coming up</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m curious what you&rsquo;re going to do to reset</p>
<p>in the hours, the frequency of running is every four hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to allow you to get any more</p>
<p>than a couple hours sleep in between.</p>
<p>Couple hours.</p>
<p>So we should tell it to people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to get your thoughts and advice on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on March 5th, running 48 miles with Mr. David Goggins.</p>
<p>So four miles every four hours and people should join us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, that mad man is going to be live on Instagram</p>
<p>starting at 8 p.m. Pacific on March 5th.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to join him in person.</p>
<p>In person.</p>
<p>Undisclosed location.</p>
<p>And I was trying to clarify like, okay,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re going to like, there&rsquo;ll be like friendly people</p>
<p>around or something.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just me and him.</p>
<p>Friendly people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, I just feel it&rsquo;s very difficult to be</p>
<p>with David alone in a room.</p>
<p>I imagine his, I mean, I&rsquo;ve done some work with David.</p>
<p>His energy is infectious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an intense schedule.</p>
<p>And the periodicity of those four hour,</p>
<p>every four hours, four miles means</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no chance of catching</p>
<p>an extended block of sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about three hours that you have</p>
<p>non exercising every time.</p>
<p>And of course, it takes time to try to fall asleep</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an intensity to the whole thing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s probably impossible to get anything more</p>
<p>than two hours of sleep if you wanted to.</p>
<p>So the optimal thing is probably from the sound of it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to see what you think,</p>
<p>but like it&rsquo;s getting a few 90 minute naps.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I thought about this a bit</p>
<p>before we met up today.</p>
<p>So I think there are two general approaches</p>
<p>that could work.</p>
<p>Neither one necessarily better than the other.</p>
<p>One would be just to hammer through the whole thing,</p>
<p>just to get your level of alertness and adrenaline ramped up</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t expect yourself to sleep.</p>
<p>There are certain advantages there.</p>
<p>One is a subjective kind of emotional advantages,</p>
<p>which is if you can&rsquo;t sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be stressed about that.</p>
<p>And if you do fall asleep, it&rsquo;s a bonus,</p>
<p>provided you wake up and you don&rsquo;t look up</p>
<p>and you realize David&rsquo;s been out running for half an hour</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re behind, right?</p>
<p>But chances are, that&rsquo;s not the way it&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>You set an alarm.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one approach.</p>
<p>And I grabbed that from a couple of friends</p>
<p>who were in the SEAL teams and they&rsquo;ll say that,</p>
<p>during BUDS, there&rsquo;s this infamous hell week</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this five days,</p>
<p>definitely five days of no sleep,</p>
<p>although there is a component where they offer a nap</p>
<p>at one particular point.</p>
<p>And a lot of people will say that it&rsquo;s worse</p>
<p>to go down for that nap and then be woken up 20 minutes later</p>
<p>than to just stay up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one option.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it the full blitz hammer through option.</p>
<p>And if you happen to fall asleep, you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bonus.</p>
<p>The other one would be to really anchor</p>
<p>in these ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So coming back from a run,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re thoroughly exhausted,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to have a few minutes</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to want to stay awake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be hard to just immediately fall asleep.</p>
<p>And getting as much sleep as you can</p>
<p>in the intervening periods,</p>
<p>provided that you guys aren&rsquo;t posting constantly</p>
<p>or doing something else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question of whether or not you want to nourish,</p>
<p>whether or not you want to eat or not in that time.</p>
<p>Anytime we put food in our gut,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s meat or oatmeal</p>
<p>or broccoli or cardboard,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drawing blood into the gut.</p>
<p>And so you are going to divert some energy</p>
<p>towards digestion and it&rsquo;s going to make you sleepy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why the rest and digest,</p>
<p>the parasympathetic nervous system is called that.</p>
<p>So you could decide that you were only going to sleep</p>
<p>in between certain blocks.</p>
<p>That would be another way to think about this.</p>
<p>Because I did this last year.</p>
<p>I ran very slow.</p>
<p>Some of it was walking.</p>
<p>I was listening to audio books.</p>
<p>And one of the biggest mistakes I did is to overeat</p>
<p>during that time.</p>
<p>It made the experience very unpleasant.</p>
<p>So I have been considering basically eating almost nothing</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>Being fasted will increase alertness</p>
<p>because high levels of epinephrine in your system</p>
<p>from fasting.</p>
<p>You just think about fasting or being thirsty</p>
<p>before you get exhausted.</p>
<p>People always think if I don&rsquo;t eat, I&rsquo;m going to be tired.</p>
<p>No, the energy that you derive from food</p>
<p>is going to be used from glycogen after a long storage</p>
<p>and conversion process.</p>
<p>So the food that you eat is going to consume energy</p>
<p>to digest.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people feel better fasted.</p>
<p>And presumably throughout history,</p>
<p>people have fasted for long periods of time</p>
<p>and had to stay up for two or three days.</p>
<p>And God forbid, if a family member is sick,</p>
<p>you can stay awake in the hospital without any trouble.</p>
<p>So that alertness system, it&rsquo;s all mental.</p>
<p>Actually, and then there&rsquo;s a third.</p>
<p>So you could try and sleep or take care in between.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a third approach.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t come up with it, but David did.</p>
<p>So I actually texted him earlier</p>
<p>because I had a feeling that I heard</p>
<p>that you were going to do this challenge.</p>
<p>So I asked David.</p>
<p>So these are David Goggins words, not mine.</p>
<p>One, being organized is super important.</p>
<p>Two, you want to waste as little time as possible.</p>
<p>Three, you need to eat, sleep and rehab</p>
<p>in as little time as possible</p>
<p>so you can sleep as much as possible.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the first time I&rsquo;m reading this.</p>
<p>Four, meal prep and gear prep, et cetera, are very important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s consistent with everything I know about military.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t leave too much to chance.</p>
<p>Five, again, these are David&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>All that said, he&rsquo;s fucked on most all that</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;ll be interviewing me before or after.</p>
<p>I will also be interviewing him.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Five, long story short,</p>
<p>the only thing that might help is a very special pill.</p>
<p>Ooh, this is interesting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called SIU pills.</p>
<p>Hard to get, but I believe he can get them.</p>
<p>SIU stands for suck it up.</p>
<p>Tell him to grab his balls.</p>
<p>He will find those pills there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s number six, all right.</p>
<p>And then the last one, stay hard, brother.</p>
<p>Stay hard, brother.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>That was one of the other things</p>
<p>that I think makes this challenging</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;ll be doing a podcast throughout.</p>
<p>So first of all, I&rsquo;ll do a long one before and after,</p>
<p>but also I&rsquo;ll have to come up</p>
<p>with things to talk to him about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different thing to do something privately</p>
<p>and then publicly.</p>
<p>I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem that way,</p>
<p>but one of the hardest,</p>
<p>the hardest thing I had to do last time</p>
<p>was to turn on the camera and talk to the camera</p>
<p>because last time I did it,</p>
<p>I recorded every single time I did a leg,</p>
<p>I recorded something I&rsquo;m grateful for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of unrelated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of talking about how I&rsquo;m feeling</p>
<p>or how the run is going.</p>
<p>I want to do something totally unrelated to the run</p>
<p>and with the run as the background,</p>
<p>sort of something I&rsquo;m grateful for</p>
<p>or just any kind of interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Gratitude, I mean, I hate the word hack,</p>
<p>like, oh, it&rsquo;s a dopamine hack or it&rsquo;s a serotonin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the word hack because A,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s disrespectful to hackers who do a real thing</p>
<p>and B, a hack implies that it&rsquo;s some sort of trick</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re kind of gaming the system.</p>
<p>You know, what works is mechanism, right?</p>
<p>Biological mechanisms were designed to work</p>
<p>and they were selected for to work</p>
<p>under variable conditions.</p>
<p>And as you know, and I know,</p>
<p>and we have great appreciation for the fact</p>
<p>that the nervous system was designed</p>
<p>to be an adaptive machine</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t have to sleep eight hours every night.</p>
<p>You can do this thing.</p>
<p>And things like gratitude allow you to tap</p>
<p>into chemical resources.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a hack.</p>
<p>The fact that being grateful for something external</p>
<p>to the event happens to release serotonin</p>
<p>and have a certain soothing effect or a dopamine</p>
<p>and give you more epinephrine and let you go further,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a hack.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what allowed the human machine</p>
<p>to evolve to the point that it is now.</p>
<p>Every time, you know, an inventor eventually</p>
<p>created something that worked and felt great about it,</p>
<p>you can imagine that the first, you know,</p>
<p>air flight felt pretty awesome</p>
<p>and motivated those people to go on and do more.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t just go on, you know, yawn and go have a beer.</p>
<p>So being able to access the genuine internal states</p>
<p>of gratitude and reward works.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trick the system.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pretend that you&rsquo;re grateful for something,</p>
<p>but if you can identify or attach yourself</p>
<p>to some larger goal or something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeply gratifying to you,</p>
<p>or place it in service to a relative that passed away</p>
<p>that you care a lot about, that&rsquo;s not a hack.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s accessing the deepest components</p>
<p>of your nervous system.</p>
<p>And to steal your kind of lingo,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s real beauty there, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but for an introvert like myself,</p>
<p>and I think David, I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s an introvert,</p>
<p>but like, he&rsquo;s not, despite the fact</p>
<p>that he has written a great book and he communicates,</p>
<p>he puts himself out there,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not really a fan of communication.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s energized</p>
<p>by speaking his mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him well enough to know.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve done a little bit of work together</p>
<p>and, you know, we&rsquo;re in communication now and again.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obviously super impressive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It seems like he&rsquo;s a pretty private guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like, you know, so I don&rsquo;t have access to that.</p>
<p>So for me, I&rsquo;ll just speak to myself,</p>
<p>and I think David is the same,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll speak to myself that it was a hugely draining thing,</p>
<p>not to experience the gratitude,</p>
<p>experiencing the gratitude just like you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is really energizing, and it&rsquo;s a powerful thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it can lift up your mood.</p>
<p>But to turn on the camera and have to use words,</p>
<p>which is very difficult to do,</p>
<p>to explain like what you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>and do it in a way that you know</p>
<p>a bunch of people will be watching is really draining.</p>
<p>And one of the things I&rsquo;m concerned about</p>
<p>that in this whole process,</p>
<p>how do I keep my mind sharp</p>
<p>while also keeping the physical performance sharp?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a little bit scary</p>
<p>because talking to David like actual intellectually sharp,</p>
<p>like thinking, being charismatic as much as I can be,</p>
<p>and like being so maintaining a sense of humor too,</p>
<p>because I can be, I become with sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>with exhaustion, you start being.</p>
<p>The Russian bear comes out.</p>
<p>You start being such a,</p>
<p>like I become a David Goggins essentially like.</p>
<p>Oh, it makes you irritable.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation makes us irritable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear so that in the early part of the night,</p>
<p>we get a higher percentage of those old Tradian cycles</p>
<p>are occupied by slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>sometimes just called non REM sleep.</p>
<p>And those early night sleep bouts</p>
<p>are great for muscular repair</p>
<p>and for certain forms of learning,</p>
<p>but REM sleep, the rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>which it starts to accumulate</p>
<p>and occupy more of those 90 minute old Tradian cycles</p>
<p>toward the late part of a sleep bout.</p>
<p>So typically toward morning,</p>
<p>but toward after you&rsquo;ve been asleep a while,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you do the emotional processing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when we recover the ability to feel refreshed</p>
<p>and not irritated by things.</p>
<p>And if you deprive people of REM sleep,</p>
<p>they become selectively bad at uncoupling the emotion</p>
<p>from things that happened in the previous days.</p>
<p>So the little things start to seem like big things.</p>
<p>I always know I&rsquo;m REM sleep deprived when I&rsquo;m irritable.</p>
<p>And when I look at like the word the,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s spelled right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m kind of pissed off about it.</p>
<p>Like something&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p>And we actually are becoming slightly psychotic</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re REM sleep deprived.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get a lot of REM sleep in this thing,</p>
<p>except as you fatigue more,</p>
<p>if you do fall asleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to drop more and more into REM</p>
<p>so that those 90 minute cycles,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t have to go through stage one,</p>
<p>stage two, stage three, and then REM,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to drop right into REM.</p>
<p>So you can count on your system to compensate for you.</p>
<p>But I think that just the knowledge</p>
<p>that you tend to get irritable as the time goes on,</p>
<p>just that third personing of yourself,</p>
<p>that awareness, the observer,</p>
<p>that can be very beneficial</p>
<p>because there may be bouts during this event</p>
<p>when you just should probably say nothing.</p>
<p>And maybe you just, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>smile and record or not smile or do whatever it is</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to be conserving energy.</p>
<p>If it feels like a grind,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s epinephrine being released.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s epinephrine that you could devote</p>
<p>to the physical effort.</p>
<p>But humor is an amazing anecdote for this</p>
<p>because it resets that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that dopamine release</p>
<p>that gives us that fresh perspective.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a real chemical thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a hack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a trick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a visualization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s biology in action.</p>
<p>Well, but I think the act of interviewing,</p>
<p>of conversation in these processes,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t want to do it,</p>
<p>the right thing to do, even when you&rsquo;re feeling irritable,</p>
<p>is to do the third person view</p>
<p>and be able to express with words</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re feeling irritable.</p>
<p>Like express what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>Use words, which I hate doing.</p>
<p>I honestly, I think my ultimate thing</p>
<p>would be just to never say a single word to David Gagas</p>
<p>and just go through hell.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what we do,</p>
<p>but to do it quietly, to also express it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my ultimate hell.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s definitely going to be,</p>
<p>if I know David at all,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to try and find your buttons.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s going to, I mean,</p>
<p>even though he knows he can complete this,</p>
<p>and I believe that he trusts that you can complete it too,</p>
<p>I believe you will complete it.</p>
<p>You know you will complete it, right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about that.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not going to make it easier for you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to make it harder.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s very difficult for me.</p>
<p>So 48 miles is not easy.</p>
<p>I have not been training that much.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not ramping up,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like going to kill me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>Of course, for him, he might always get bored</p>
<p>because I think the 48 miles for him is easy.</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that that ever gets easy.</p>
<p>I have a friend, Casey Cordial, who works with David.</p>
<p>He does some physical rehab type stuff with him.</p>
<p>And he took Casey on a 50 miler</p>
<p>and Casey said it&rsquo;s like 16 miles and do it.</p>
<p>He was just like, he had hit his wall,</p>
<p>but he found it.</p>
<p>They find it to get, you know, you find that portal.</p>
<p>There is one thing I want to mention.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some very good physiology</p>
<p>that can perhaps support the actual running effort part.</p>
<p>These are very new data.</p>
<p>We have a study going on with David Spiegel at Stanford,</p>
<p>looking at how different patterns of breathing</p>
<p>can affect heart rate variability.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability is good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this interesting mechanism</p>
<p>that I think most people might not realize,</p>
<p>but that medical students learn that your breathing</p>
<p>and your heart rate and your brain</p>
<p>are in this really remarkable interplay.</p>
<p>It goes like this.</p>
<p>When you inhale, this isn&rsquo;t breath work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to do breath work.</p>
<p>But when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down.</p>
<p>The heart gets a little bigger</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a little more space in the thoracic cavity.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, blood flows a little bit more slowly</p>
<p>through that larger volume.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a category of neurons, the sinonitrile node,</p>
<p>that sees that, that recognizes that slower rate</p>
<p>through that larger volume.</p>
<p>It sends a signal to the brainstem</p>
<p>and the brainstem sends a signal back to the heart</p>
<p>to speed the heart up.</p>
<p>So every time you inhale, you&rsquo;re speeding the heart up.</p>
<p>When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,</p>
<p>the heart gets a little smaller, the volume is smaller,</p>
<p>blood flows more quickly through the heart,</p>
<p>signal sent up to the brain,</p>
<p>and the brain sends a signal back to slow the heart down.</p>
<p>This is the basis of heart rate variability.</p>
<p>So at any point, if you feel like your heart is racing</p>
<p>and you feel like you&rsquo;re working too hard</p>
<p>per unit of effort,</p>
<p>focus on making your exhales longer</p>
<p>or more intense than your inhales.</p>
<p>If ever you feel like you&rsquo;re truly flagging,</p>
<p>you do not have the energy to get up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, it&rsquo;s time to go and you&rsquo;re exhausted,</p>
<p>you want to draw more oxygen into the system,</p>
<p>get your heart rate going faster.</p>
<p>Now, some people when they hear this probably think,</p>
<p>well, this is really obvious,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much out there about breath work</p>
<p>and how to breathe and all this stuff,</p>
<p>but no one talks about how to do it in real time</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re exerting effort.</p>
<p>So this is something like almost like second by second,</p>
<p>you can adjust things just in real time</p>
<p>based on how you&rsquo;re feeling,</p>
<p>but based on the heart rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The experience of the heart rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So one thing that could be very efficient</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing some work with athletes now,</p>
<p>so these are unpublished data,</p>
<p>but if you, while you&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>if you want to get into a nice cadence</p>
<p>of heart rate variability, do double inhales</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re running.</p>
<p>What this will do is that when you do the double inhale</p>
<p>has the effect of reopening the alveoli of the lungs,</p>
<p>your lungs are filled with tons of little sacks,</p>
<p>when they tend to collapse as you fatigue</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we start getting stressed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been sprinting and you start getting beat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going as hard as you can,</p>
<p>what you really need to do is double inhale</p>
<p>and reinflate these sacks in the lungs</p>
<p>and then offload a lot of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re at a steady cadence and you&rsquo;re feeling good,</p>
<p>double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale</p>
<p>is a terrific way to breathe</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re in ongoing effort.</p>
<p>By the way, any recommendations or differences</p>
<p>in nose or mouth breathing?</p>
<p>So nasal breathing, there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement now,</p>
<p>obviously about nasal breathing</p>
<p>because of James Nestor&rsquo;s book, Breath.</p>
<p>There was also, if people are going to know about that book,</p>
<p>I do feel like out of respect for my colleagues,</p>
<p>there was a book by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich</p>
<p>at Stanford, both professors at Stanford</p>
<p>with a forward by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.</p>
<p>So some heavy hitters in this book.</p>
<p>And the book is called Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about how nasal breathing is better for us,</p>
<p>especially kids, than being mouth breathers</p>
<p>under most conditions for sake of improving immunity.</p>
<p>It turns out there&rsquo;s a microbiome in the nose,</p>
<p>like all sorts of good stuff</p>
<p>about nasal breathing preferentially.</p>
<p>But when we exercise, you can do pure nasal breathing.</p>
<p>But the problem is once you get up to kind of third</p>
<p>and fourth and fifth gear effort,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t nasal breathe and be at maximum capacity</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve been training it for a very long time.</p>
<p>So I would say double inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>offload through the mouth.</p>
<p>So double inhale, exhale while you&rsquo;re in steady effort.</p>
<p>And then if you really feel like you need to gas it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re pushing, the data show that then</p>
<p>just use whatever&rsquo;s there, right?</p>
<p>Just go into kind of default mode</p>
<p>because bringing too much concentration to something</p>
<p>is also going to spend epinephrine.</p>
<p>The goal is to get into that, I don&rsquo;t like the word,</p>
<p>but the flow state where you&rsquo;re not thinking too much,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just in exertion.</p>
<p>So these are things that can help in the transitions,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any secret breathing technique.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s been in the SEAL teams will kind of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you like, there&rsquo;s no breathing technique, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tools that you can look to from time to time.</p>
<p>And these double inhale exhales can be great</p>
<p>for setting heart rate variability very quickly</p>
<p>and getting into a steady cadence while you&rsquo;re exercising.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s a sprint,</p>
<p>like if suddenly you guys are sprinting,</p>
<p>ditch the double inhale, exhale, and just sprint.</p>
<p>One thing that you mentioned,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably gonna push my buttons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good place to ask a question about anger.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll probably get pissed off at him at some point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>
<p>And do you have thoughts from a scientific perspective</p>
<p>or also just the personal philosophical perspective</p>
<p>about the role of anger in all of this</p>
<p>and in managing alertness, performance?</p>
<p>I think about this a lot</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much out there</p>
<p>about how important it is to do things</p>
<p>from a place of love, you know.</p>
<p>I tweet about it all the time.</p>
<p>And I think, and love is powerful, right?</p>
<p>It is interesting that autonomic arousal alertness,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just use simple language,</p>
<p>alertness physiologically looks identical</p>
<p>for love and excitement as it does for anger</p>
<p>and frustration and wanting to defeat your opponent</p>
<p>or whoever that opponent happens to be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re identical except that the love component</p>
<p>does tend to be associated with the release</p>
<p>of neurochemicals of the serotonin and dopamine type</p>
<p>that do have this replenishment component.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think one wants to be in constant anger</p>
<p>and friction, but I mean, I&rsquo;ll come clean a bit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been portions of my career</p>
<p>where some of my best work, my extra two hours,</p>
<p>my ability to nail a really hard deadline or problem</p>
<p>has come from not wanting to get out competed</p>
<p>or from wanting to prove something.</p>
<p>These days, I&rsquo;m not oriented from that place</p>
<p>toward my work quite as often,</p>
<p>but I think we should be really honest.</p>
<p>Anger is powerful provided it&rsquo;s channeled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very powerful and it can give you a ton of fuel</p>
<p>and gas to push when otherwise you tap.</p>
<p>Yeah, Joe Rogan has, aside from being a fan of his,</p>
<p>has been an inspiration to sort of be,</p>
<p>to have a kind of loving view on the world</p>
<p>and the way you approach the world to me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve tended to want to approach the world that way,</p>
<p>but in the same way, David Goggins has been an inspiration</p>
<p>to like, yeah, be angry at stuff and use it as fuel.</p>
<p>Like he almost conjures up artificial demons in his mind</p>
<p>just so he can fight them.</p>
<p>You know, but at the same time I tried that</p>
<p>because I did a challenge in the summer</p>
<p>of where for 30 days I was doing a lot of pushups</p>
<p>and it was, over time, it was counterproductive for me.</p>
<p>Like I found that it was easier to just,</p>
<p>like the rollercoaster that the emotional,</p>
<p>like being angry at stuff takes you can also be exhausting.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, and it can take you down,</p>
<p>like the ups of it are good, but the downs are bad.</p>
<p>And what I found is better to get,</p>
<p>to use it as a boost every once in a while,</p>
<p>but mostly to get lost in the,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about the breath work,</p>
<p>the like getting lost in the ritual of it,</p>
<p>like the beat like that,</p>
<p>as opposed to going on the big rollercoasters of emotion.</p>
<p>Yet this brings us into the realm of neuroendocrinology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating relationship between</p>
<p>the hormone system and the nervous system.</p>
<p>And, you know, hormones work in general on slower timescales.</p>
<p>The definition of a hormone is a chemical released</p>
<p>at one location in the body,</p>
<p>goes and acts at multiple locations far away</p>
<p>within the body.</p>
<p>Pheromone would be between two bodies.</p>
<p>Neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>tend to work a little more quickly.</p>
<p>There are hormones like adrenaline and cortisol</p>
<p>that can work very fast,</p>
<p>but here I&rsquo;m referring mainly to testosterone, prolactin.</p>
<p>Prolactin tends to be in men,</p>
<p>and women tends to make people kind of lazy</p>
<p>and want to take care of young.</p>
<p>It tends to throw down body fat so we can stay up late.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s secreted in response to having children.</p>
<p>These are all in humans and in animals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very interesting relationship</p>
<p>between testosterone and dopamine</p>
<p>that speaks directly to what we&rsquo;re talking about now.</p>
<p>So dopamine and testosterone are closely related</p>
<p>in the pituitary system.</p>
<p>And obviously testosterone comes from the adrenals</p>
<p>and from the testes.</p>
<p>But the major effect of testosterone</p>
<p>is to make effort feel good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what testosterone does.</p>
<p>It has other effects too, right?</p>
<p>Reproductive effects,</p>
<p>androgenizing parts of the body, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it makes effort feel good.</p>
<p>The testosterone molecule is synthesized from cholesterol.</p>
<p>Cholesterol can either be made into cortisol,</p>
<p>a stress hormone, or testosterone, but not both.</p>
<p>So you have a limited amount of cholesterol</p>
<p>and it gets diverted towards stress</p>
<p>or this pathway where effort feels good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the pathway you want to get into.</p>
<p>The anger pathway,</p>
<p>if we were to just kind of play a mind experiment here,</p>
<p>the anger eventually is going to divert</p>
<p>more of that cholesterol molecule to cortisol and stress,</p>
<p>and you will be slowly depleting testosterone.</p>
<p>Now going into this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have plenty of testosterone,</p>
<p>but after a couple of days,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been very interesting studies showing</p>
<p>that testosterone doesn&rsquo;t necessarily drop</p>
<p>with sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of a myth.</p>
<p>You need it to replenish testosterone.</p>
<p>You need sleep to replenish testosterone eventually.</p>
<p>But the real question is,</p>
<p>are you enjoying what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>And here the work was,</p>
<p>some of the major work on this was done by Duncan French,</p>
<p>who runs the UFC Training Center.</p>
<p>He did his PhD at UConn stores,</p>
<p>did a really beautiful PhD thesis</p>
<p>looking at the relationship between stress hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone, and dopamine.</p>
<p>Really interesting work.</p>
<p>And the takeaway from all of this is,</p>
<p>if you can just convince yourself,</p>
<p>or ideally if you can just enjoy yourself,</p>
<p>you are going to maintain</p>
<p>or maybe even increase testosterone stores,</p>
<p>which will make effort feel good.</p>
<p>And to me, aside from neuroplasticity</p>
<p>where everything becomes automatic after this experience,</p>
<p>to me, that&rsquo;s the holy grail.</p>
<p>When effort feels good, life just gets way better.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not talking about achieving the reward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the end of this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the process of it feeling really good.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is a magic to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on this,</p>
<p>but I find myself being able to,</p>
<p>if I just say I&rsquo;m feeling good,</p>
<p>like this old hack of like smiling while you&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>if I just tell myself, I&rsquo;m feeling really good right now,</p>
<p>no matter how I&rsquo;m actually feeling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start feeling way better.</p>
<p>And the whole thing, there&rsquo;s a cascading effect</p>
<p>that allows me to maximize the effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Hormones are powerful.</p>
<p>The relationship between thoughts and hormones</p>
<p>and these physiological things is enormous.</p>
<p>I had a colleague that a few years ago,</p>
<p>he was dying of pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>And I was interviewing him</p>
<p>just because he&rsquo;s an important figure in our community.</p>
<p>And I was a friend.</p>
<p>And there was one day where he told me,</p>
<p>he said, I don&rsquo;t want to make it past the new year.</p>
<p>And it was crushing for me to hear.</p>
<p>And I knew that he had been on some androgen therapy</p>
<p>for a whole set of other things.</p>
<p>And I said, have you taken your androgen cream?</p>
<p>And he was like, no, I haven&rsquo;t done it.</p>
<p>Go get it for me.</p>
<p>I have this on film.</p>
<p>He takes it, he puts the androgen cream on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting people take androgens, by the way.</p>
<p>10 minutes later, he says, you know what?</p>
<p>I think I want to live into the new year.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to write 12 letters of recommendation.</p>
<p>He went to MIT, by the way.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m going to write 12 letters of recommendation.</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s something about these molecules</p>
<p>that in an ancient way, in all organisms,</p>
<p>all mammals, as far as we know,</p>
<p>are linked to the will to live.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re linked to effort and making effort feel good,</p>
<p>which has been fundamental to the evolution of our species.</p>
<p>I always say, people think that the opposite</p>
<p>of testosterone is estrogen, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The opposite of testosterone is prolactin,</p>
<p>which makes us feel quiescent</p>
<p>and not in pursuit of things, et cetera.</p>
<p>Testosterone makes effort feel good.</p>
<p>Estrogen makes emotions feel okay.</p>
<p>And they are in mixed amounts in people,</p>
<p>as I say, have all chromosomal backgrounds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you also mentioned fasting potentially</p>
<p>through this two day thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool to get your thoughts about fasting in general.</p>
<p>Do you think on a personal level</p>
<p>and at a higher sort of level of studies</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re aware of and physiology and so on,</p>
<p>what do you think about intermittent fasting</p>
<p>of like not eating for 16 hours</p>
<p>and then having an eight hour window</p>
<p>or something I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot recently,</p>
<p>which is eating only once a day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 24 hour fast, I guess, one meal a day</p>
<p>or something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done yet of doing like 72 hours</p>
<p>or some people do like five day fasts in general.</p>
<p>So this will be for this particular run</p>
<p>will be a 48 hour fast if I don&rsquo;t eat at all.</p>
<p>What do you think about that for performance,</p>
<p>for mood, for all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>I can speak a little bit to the science</p>
<p>and a little bit of my own experience</p>
<p>and then some anecdotes of people that have done very hard,</p>
<p>very long duration things and what they&rsquo;ve told me.</p>
<p>So I just want to make sure I&rsquo;m separating those out</p>
<p>so people know my sourcing.</p>
<p>I think now none of this is about the actual</p>
<p>longterm nutritional benefits of one thing or the other.</p>
<p>But if you look at the science on intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>Before I was at Stanford, my lab was in San Diego.</p>
<p>One of my colleagues was such in Panda at the Salk</p>
<p>is phenomenal biologist and researcher,</p>
<p>wrote a book called the circadian code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very good and kind of popularized</p>
<p>intermittent fasting, although there were others</p>
<p>that had talked about this before.</p>
<p>Ori Hofmechler talked about the warrior diet.</p>
<p>People probably might not know who Ori is,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s sort of the originator</p>
<p>of this business of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>eating once a day or limited.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sachin has published papers,</p>
<p>peer reviewed papers in very good journals</p>
<p>like Cell and elsewhere,</p>
<p>showing that limiting the consumption of calories</p>
<p>to eight, four, six, or eight, or even 10 hours</p>
<p>of every 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>and keeping that more or less correlated with the light</p>
<p>with when the sun is out leads to less liver disease,</p>
<p>improved metabolic markers, less body fat, et cetera.</p>
<p>In the mouse studies, they even gave the mice the choice</p>
<p>to eat whatever they wanted, as much as they want,</p>
<p>as long as they restrict it to a certain period</p>
<p>within the 24 hour cycle, they did great.</p>
<p>They maintained a healthy weight or even lost weight.</p>
<p>When they took the same amount of food</p>
<p>and they stretched it out across the entire 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>So this is eating every hour or two hours,</p>
<p>the animals got fat and sick.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty remarkable data.</p>
<p>How much of that translates to humans isn&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>but one thing that&rsquo;s really clear with humans is adherence.</p>
<p>We could talk a lot about nutrition</p>
<p>and some of the problems with the studies on nutrition</p>
<p>is that what people will do in a laboratory</p>
<p>is often hard to do in the real world.</p>
<p>Low carbohydrate diets just they tend,</p>
<p>because they tend to focus on foods</p>
<p>that have high amino acid content like meats.</p>
<p>Generally people are less hungry on those</p>
<p>than they are on calorie matched diets</p>
<p>of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates,</p>
<p>because when the insulin goes up,</p>
<p>you get hungry and you want to eat more.</p>
<p>So this is not a push for carnivore</p>
<p>or a push against one thing or the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, there are a lot of factors,</p>
<p>but we know for sure that when you&rsquo;re fasted</p>
<p>or when you have low amounts of carbohydrate in your system,</p>
<p>complex carbohydrate, your alertness is going to go up.</p>
<p>Fasting increases alertness and epinephrine</p>
<p>for the sole purpose of getting you to go out</p>
<p>and find food.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if our ancestors got hungry</p>
<p>and they were like, oh, I&rsquo;m too tired to go find food.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like robots or something.</p>
<p>One of your alien buddies will be like running the planet.</p>
<p>So I think that if you want to be alert,</p>
<p>fasting or keeping complex carbohydrates to a minimum</p>
<p>is very valuable.</p>
<p>If you want to sleep and you want to be sleepy,</p>
<p>ingesting foods that have a lot of tryptophan,</p>
<p>which is the precursor to serotonin,</p>
<p>so complex carbohydrates like rice and grains,</p>
<p>turkey, white meats,</p>
<p>those things do create a sense of sleepiness.</p>
<p>However, there is a caveat,</p>
<p>and this is one problem with the once a day meal,</p>
<p>is that anytime you have a lot of food in the gut,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasing sleepiness</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re diverting blood to the gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to trigger the vagus to signal to the brain</p>
<p>to shut down your system and utilize those nutrients,</p>
<p>digest and utilize those nutrients.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done the once a day eating thing.</p>
<p>The problem is I eat so much in that meal</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m exhausted.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t always lend itself well to the schedule.</p>
<p>But so in a six or eight hour eating block for me</p>
<p>is a little bit better.</p>
<p>I do eat carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably one of the few people left on the West coast</p>
<p>that actually consumes carbohydrates</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll say that out loud.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know people eat carbs anymore, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Where do you even find carbs these days?</p>
<p>I like oatmeal.</p>
<p>I like rice.</p>
<p>The other time is if people are doing very high intensity</p>
<p>weight train, they need to replenish glycogen.</p>
<p>On the alertness side,</p>
<p>I do feel like it&rsquo;s probably person dependent.</p>
<p>For me alertness, being alert makes my life better</p>
<p>in a lot of ways, more than just the alertness itself.</p>
<p>Like for example, one of the things I discovered</p>
<p>with fasting is that when I was training twice a day</p>
<p>in jujitsu, for example, and competing and so on,</p>
<p>I performed way better at things that you traditionally</p>
<p>would say you need carbs for,</p>
<p>which is explosive movements and all that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I actually perform better</p>
<p>in terms of like the force of the explosion,</p>
<p>the explosiveness.</p>
<p>What I do know is the alertness resulted</p>
<p>in me doing the technique more precisely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dopamine and epinephrine system in action.</p>
<p>And there are some other just purely physical aspects</p>
<p>to one diet versus the other that can be complicated.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ingesting carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to replenish glycogen, which is great,</p>
<p>but they also tend to be bulky and fibrous.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never rolled jujitsu,</p>
<p>but running when you have a lot of bulky fibrous food</p>
<p>in your gut or in your intestine, it can be a barrier.</p>
<p>It can be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And so some people do really well on low carbohydrate,</p>
<p>meat rich diets, because they&rsquo;re just not as bloated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not carrying as much water and other stuff.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate carries a lot of water molecules with it.</p>
<p>So there are aspects to being able to train</p>
<p>and being really explosive because you feel light.</p>
<p>One anecdote that really, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not encouraging any one particular kind of diet,</p>
<p>but I have a friend who was in the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>I happen to know a number of people in that community.</p>
<p>And he told me that he did this very long fast.</p>
<p>It was a fast that I think you get to eat a little bit</p>
<p>of soup or broth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like a bar or something,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a nine day thing.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a very strong athlete.</p>
<p>And he said that on day six or seven,</p>
<p>he was running up some hills or something</p>
<p>while he was on deployment.</p>
<p>And he felt amazing.</p>
<p>He had kind of hit this other level.</p>
<p>He was somebody who had boxed in the Naval Academy.</p>
<p>He was somebody who knows and knew high output.</p>
<p>And he felt like he discovered the 13th floor,</p>
<p>that there was another floor to this performance space</p>
<p>that he hadn&rsquo;t experienced except while he had fasted.</p>
<p>And he said that that was a remarkable clarity of mind,</p>
<p>energy, it&rsquo;s a little bit of what you described.</p>
<p>He described a kind of suppleness and explosiveness.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably something there.</p>
<p>On which day?</p>
<p>At once he was in the fifth or sixth day of the fast.</p>
<p>See, this is the thing is I&rsquo;ve never been there</p>
<p>on the second, third, fourth, fifth day, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But when I just don&rsquo;t eat for 20 hours,</p>
<p>many times through my training, the clarity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you feel like everyone is moving super slowly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to like dominate people</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t able to before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Well, you might&rsquo;ve slipped into,</p>
<p>or switched over rather into full ketosis.</p>
<p>And ketogenic diets done properly can be great for people.</p>
<p>The problem is if you do it wrong, you can really mess it up.</p>
<p>I tried it once and I basically got psoriasis.</p>
<p>I thought my scalp was going to fall off.</p>
<p>I was like sloughing off all this.</p>
<p>And then I stopped and I was taking the liquid ketones.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden I felt better again.</p>
<p>But I was told that I just did it wrong.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a right way and a wrong way</p>
<p>and you have to get it right.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve experimented quite a bit with keto</p>
<p>to see how my body feels and doing it the right way</p>
<p>and following all the instructions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a huge difference that,</p>
<p>like for example, one of the things I discovered,</p>
<p>everyone knows who said this,</p>
<p>but I tried this recently over the past year</p>
<p>is I started drinking when I don&rsquo;t feel great.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m fasting, a bone broth, a chicken bone broth.</p>
<p>And for some reason, like magically it could be,</p>
<p>this is the other thing, the mind, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it makes me feel really good.</p>
<p>Well, it could be the salt.</p>
<p>So I mean, neurons, the action potential neurons,</p>
<p>as you know, is sodium is rushing into the cell.</p>
<p>You need enough extracellular sodium</p>
<p>in order for your brain and nervous system to function.</p>
<p>And so salt, I mean, unless people have hypertension,</p>
<p>salt is great.</p>
<p>There was an article in Science Magazine about a decade ago</p>
<p>about how salt had been demonized</p>
<p>and unless people have hypertension,</p>
<p>provide you drink enough water, salt is great.</p>
<p>You need sodium, magnesium, and potassium to function</p>
<p>and for your nerve cells to work.</p>
<p>I mean, people who overdrink water</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t consume enough electrolyte die.</p>
<p>Now, hydration is really important.</p>
<p>I know David&rsquo;s really into hydration.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s mentioned that a few times.</p>
<p>I mean, hydrating properly is key.</p>
<p>And so you definitely want to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re drinking enough water</p>
<p>and getting enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>We should have actually talked about that at the beginning</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to keep</p>
<p>your nervous system functioning well.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, they&rsquo;ll get shaky or jittery</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re fasting and they&rsquo;ll think they need sugar.</p>
<p>And if they just put some salt in some water,</p>
<p>they feel fine.</p>
<p>And like the other stuff, potassium, magnesium,</p>
<p>whatever the other electrolytes are.</p>
<p>But yeah, those three.</p>
<p>I mean, salt, yeah.</p>
<p>Magnesium is good before sleep.</p>
<p>Salt.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a vast space.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of talking about the overlap</p>
<p>between neurochemicals, hormones, and nutrition.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fascinating space.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that the academic community has gems</p>
<p>within the textbooks.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t really made it into the public sphere yet.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s because people get so caught up</p>
<p>in the being, are you vegan or are you carnivore?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a vast space in between too</p>
<p>that people can explore.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not a competitive athlete.</p>
<p>So I eat meat and I also eat vegetables and I eat fruits</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just about timing them.</p>
<p>But I tend to eat carbohydrates when I want to be sleepy.</p>
<p>I eat them at night.</p>
<p>And everyone said, that&rsquo;s the worst thing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You sleep great after eating a big bowl of pasta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>And by the way, I should give you a big thank you</p>
<p>for connecting me with Bell Campo Farms.</p>
<p>They sent me some meat, I think because of you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>So I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>I mean, it also connected me with this whole world</p>
<p>of people who are doing farming in this ethical way</p>
<p>and like really love the whole process.</p>
<p>And from both like a human level,</p>
<p>but also scientific level.</p>
<p>And the result is, it&rsquo;s like ethical,</p>
<p>but also it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>And it makes you think about your diet</p>
<p>in a whole new kind of way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have any commercial relationship</p>
<p>to Bell Campo, so I can be very clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known Anya Fernald,</p>
<p>who is the founder and CEO of Bell Campo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known her since the ninth grade.</p>
<p>It is true that her parents are faculty members at Stanford,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re colleagues of mine,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s just a serious academic of nutrition,</p>
<p>but also of sustainable agriculture,</p>
<p>of all sorts of things.</p>
<p>And also the meat just, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It tastes really good.</p>
<p>And no, I&rsquo;m not getting paid to say that.</p>
<p>And no, they&rsquo;re not a sponsoring my podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I feel like if you&rsquo;re gonna eat animals,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s in your framework and you&rsquo;re gonna eat animals,</p>
<p>knowing that the animals were raised as happy as could be</p>
<p>until time of slaughter is at least important to me.</p>
<p>And actually talked to her,</p>
<p>so I will talk to her on this podcast actually.</p>
<p>And she invited me like a week ago out to visit the farm</p>
<p>in May or June or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, they have the farm up at the Oregon border.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been there yet, but I&rsquo;ve seen the pictures.</p>
<p>It looks awesome and I was like, yes.</p>
<p>It looks beautiful.</p>
<p>Let me know when you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably run there, but I&rsquo;ll drive there.</p>
<p>Yeah, but all that said, I do want to,</p>
<p>cause a lot of people who are vegan write to me</p>
<p>and I do want to seriously,</p>
<p>in the same seriousness that I approached keto,</p>
<p>I do wanna go like on a few months</p>
<p>to switch to a vegan diet at some point to really try it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done it yet</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m gonna function better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Argentine by my dad&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t eat meat super often,</p>
<p>but well, for most people it would seem often,</p>
<p>but I do love steak, I do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m gonna feel better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a social element to steak, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Cause coming from a Russian background,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t imagine going to visit my folks,</p>
<p>like my parents for Thanksgiving or something to say,</p>
<p>mom and dad, I don&rsquo;t eat meat.</p>
<p>So instead of, you know.</p>
<p>Well, I think if you&rsquo;re gonna eat meat,</p>
<p>getting it from sources that are compatible</p>
<p>with a continuation of the planet is good.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some real problems</p>
<p>with the factory farm meat.</p>
<p>You know, you drive up and down the five</p>
<p>and you pass that point where there are all those cows.</p>
<p>I mean, as somebody who loves animals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>you wanna limit the amount of suffering of those animals.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear about, you know,</p>
<p>we know people that hunt and that go and get their own meat.</p>
<p>I really admire that.</p>
<p>I admire that people do that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t tend to do that in the hills around Stanford,</p>
<p>you know, there are mountain lions back there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly, I admire the vegan mindset</p>
<p>of just making that decision.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not gonna consume other beings,</p>
<p>but you know, I haven&rsquo;t gone that way.</p>
<p>But performance wise, I&rsquo;m just curious because I was</p>
<p>surprised, I was certain that eating five, six,</p>
<p>seven meals a day is the right thing to do</p>
<p>for if you wanna be perform your best</p>
<p>when I was like 20 or whatever.</p>
<p>And I would eat oatmeal, like I thought it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>I have to have a really, a lot of carbs in the breakfast.</p>
<p>I had a lot of preconceived notions.</p>
<p>And then when I started eating like once a day,</p>
<p>this was at the peak of my competing in jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>it was like, everything I know about nutrition is wrong.</p>
<p>You realize that like, you have to become a scientist.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to read literature,</p>
<p>you have to learn, you have to experiment,</p>
<p>but you also have to become a scientist of your own body.</p>
<p>In the same way, I have a lot of preconceived notions</p>
<p>of what performance is like under vegan diet.</p>
<p>And I want to do it right.</p>
<p>Like seriously, not necessarily for the ethical reasons,</p>
<p>but to see if it&rsquo;s performance wise, like can I,</p>
<p>I remember there&rsquo;s like a fruitarian diet</p>
<p>where you eat fruit only.</p>
<p>These extremes are like, they&rsquo;re pretty,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re interesting cause people have this need.</p>
<p>The extremes are informative though, right?</p>
<p>I mean, well controlled experiments,</p>
<p>you eliminate as many variables as you can</p>
<p>except the one you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>So people are running these experiments.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine getting,</p>
<p>I know people say you can get enough amino acids</p>
<p>from plant based sources and I believe that.</p>
<p>I think it probably takes a little more work.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s really clear is that the benefit</p>
<p>of these omega three, omega six ratios,</p>
<p>like fish oils and things like that.</p>
<p>There are some data that show that the getting</p>
<p>at least a thousand milligrams of the EPA,</p>
<p>which is in high in fish oils, but other things too,</p>
<p>even some meats and other plants,</p>
<p>it in double, you know, in matched placebo,</p>
<p>double blind controlled studies,</p>
<p>placebo controlled double blind studies have shown</p>
<p>that those can offset antidepressive symptoms</p>
<p>as much as some of the selective serotonin reuptake</p>
<p>inhibitors like Prozac and Zoloft.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>And in Scandinavia, people know, especially in winter,</p>
<p>to consume a lot of those omega threes</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re good for you, they&rsquo;re good for the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other question.</p>
<p>Nutrition wise, what kind of stuff have you come across</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful?</p>
<p>Like I basically only take fish oil,</p>
<p>like you said, electrolytes.</p>
<p>Electrolytes with water, the David Goggins diet.</p>
<p>Fish oil.</p>
<p>Plus fish oil.</p>
<p>And then again, the sponsor, they made it so easier.</p>
<p>The sponsor of your podcast and mine,</p>
<p>athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Great stuff.</p>
<p>Support it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like it&rsquo;s great stuff for sure,</p>
<p>but it also just takes away the headache of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to think about.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re going to get a bunch of vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>It does that.</p>
<p>It sounds like a plug, but I have genuinely been buying it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know, no discount, no affiliation</p>
<p>or anything since 2012.</p>
<p>I think I heard about it on the Tim Ferriss podcast.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, I&rsquo;m going to try that stuff.</p>
<p>And I liked it.</p>
<p>I mean, when I was starting my lab,</p>
<p>I was working insane hours.</p>
<p>I still work very long hours.</p>
<p>And getting sick limits productivity.</p>
<p>And I also wanted to train</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t doing much training back then.</p>
<p>Now I try and get, you know, three, four sessions in a week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing nothing like what you and David are doing</p>
<p>or what, you know, Joe does,</p>
<p>or like you guys are way more regimented</p>
<p>and consistent than I am.</p>
<p>But I think that being healthy and feeling good</p>
<p>is one of the great benefits to a career</p>
<p>is having energy and just being not sick.</p>
<p>Can we take a step back to sleep for a little bit?</p>
<p>And so people should definitely look through your podcast.</p>
<p>The first five episodes were on sleep or no,</p>
<p>I guess the first opening episode wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>First one was sort of how the brain works generally</p>
<p>is to give people some background.</p>
<p>And then we did four episodes on sleep,</p>
<p>including some stuff about food, temperature, exercise,</p>
<p>jet lag shift work for the jet lag folks and shift work.</p>
<p>Yeah, take a masterclass on sleep.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going on to a next topic</p>
<p>in the next few episodes, which is incredible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll, neuroplasticity, we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>But on sleep, one of the cool things about the human mind</p>
<p>when it sleeps is dreaming.</p>
<p>What do you think we understand</p>
<p>about the contents of dreams?</p>
<p>Like what do dreams mean?</p>
<p>All the stuff we see when we dream,</p>
<p>is there something that we understand</p>
<p>about the contents of dreams?</p>
<p>Some of it is very concrete.</p>
<p>So Matt Wilson, who, MIT guy, showed in rodents</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been shown in nonhuman primates</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s been shown in humans</p>
<p>that there is replay of spatial information during sleep.</p>
<p>So initially what Matt showed was that</p>
<p>as these little rodents navigate through a maze,</p>
<p>there are these cells in the hippocampus called place cells</p>
<p>that fire when the animal encounters a turn or a corridor.</p>
<p>And that exact same sequence is replayed during sleep.</p>
<p>And it turns out this is true in London taxi cab drivers.</p>
<p>Before phones and GPS were what they are today,</p>
<p>the London taxi cab drivers were famous</p>
<p>for knowing the routes through the city,</p>
<p>through these mental maps.</p>
<p>And their analysis of their place cell firing during sleep</p>
<p>and during wakefulness.</p>
<p>And so we are essentially taking spatial information</p>
<p>about the location of things and replaying it during sleep.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not replayed so that you remember it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s replayed so that if there&rsquo;s a reason to remember it,</p>
<p>the links to the emotional system,</p>
<p>to the components of the limbic system and hypothalamus</p>
<p>that are relevant,</p>
<p>like you got into a car crash at a particular location,</p>
<p>or you lost a bunch of money</p>
<p>because you were a cab driver, Uber driver,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d say nowadays,</p>
<p>and you were stuck at one particular avenue all day</p>
<p>and frustrated,</p>
<p>and you were getting yelled at by your spouse,</p>
<p>that information gets encoded</p>
<p>so that you never forget that at that particular time of day</p>
<p>and that particular time of year,</p>
<p>and this thing happened.</p>
<p>So context starts getting linked to experience.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s spatial information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely replayed during sleep.</p>
<p>And we experience this sometimes as dreams.</p>
<p>The dreams that happen early in the night</p>
<p>when slow wave sleep or non REM sleep dominates,</p>
<p>tends to be sleep of very kind of general themes</p>
<p>and kind of location.</p>
<p>It can feel a little bit eerie and kind of strange.</p>
<p>Not so incidentally,</p>
<p>the early phase of the night</p>
<p>is when growth hormone is released.</p>
<p>In the 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>there was a drug that was very popular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very legal now called GHB.</p>
<p>You could actually buy it at GNC or a store then.</p>
<p>I never took it, but it was a popular party drug</p>
<p>and some famous celebrities died while on GHB.</p>
<p>They were also on a bunch of other things,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not clear what killed them.</p>
<p>But GHB was very big in certain communities</p>
<p>because it promoted a massive release of growth hormone</p>
<p>and gave people these very hypnotic states.</p>
<p>So people go to clubs</p>
<p>and they were in these very hypnotic states.</p>
<p>It was part of a whole culture.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s early night.</p>
<p>And those dreams tend to not have</p>
<p>a lot of emotional content or load.</p>
<p>That phase of dreaming is associated</p>
<p>with the occasional jolting yourself out of sleep</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s somewhat lighter sleep.</p>
<p>The dreams that occur during REM,</p>
<p>during rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>and that dominate towards morning are very different.</p>
<p>They tend to have very little epinephrine</p>
<p>is available in the brain at that time.</p>
<p>Epinephrine again being this molecule</p>
<p>of stress, fear, and excitement.</p>
<p>You are paralyzed during these REM dreams.</p>
<p>You cannot move.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s intense emotion</p>
<p>at the level of what you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so called theory of mind.</p>
<p>Theory of mind is an idea that was put forward</p>
<p>by Simon Baron Cohen, Sasha Baron Cohen&rsquo;s cousin.</p>
<p>I think on the podcast,</p>
<p>I mistakenly said that he was at Oxford.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cardinal sin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at Cambridge, forgive me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not British.</p>
<p>So the dreams in REM are heavily emotionally laden.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear that those dreams and REM sleep,</p>
<p>if you deprive yourself of them for too long,</p>
<p>you become irritable and you start linking</p>
<p>generally negative emotions to almost everything.</p>
<p>REM, the dreams that occur in REM sleep</p>
<p>are when we divorce emotion from our prior experiences.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s when we extract general rules and themes.</p>
<p>MIT seems to have come up a lot today,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s highly relevant.</p>
<p>Susumu Tonagawa, Nobel prize for immunoglobulin,</p>
<p>but obviously fantastic neuroscientist as well,</p>
<p>has shown that the replay of neurons in the hippocampus</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the brain is kind of an approximation</p>
<p>of the previous episode and a lot of fear unlearning</p>
<p>of uncoupling emotion from hard or traumatic events</p>
<p>that happened previously occurs in REM sleep.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to deprive yourself of REM sleep</p>
<p>for too long.</p>
<p>And those dreams tend to be very intense.</p>
<p>Now, epinephrine is low</p>
<p>so that you can&rsquo;t suddenly act out your dreams.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is sometimes people</p>
<p>will wake up suddenly while in a REM dream</p>
<p>and their heart will be beating really, really fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a surge of epinephrine that occurs</p>
<p>as you exit REM sleep.</p>
<p>So you were having this intense emotional experience</p>
<p>without the fear.</p>
<p>You were essentially going through therapy in your sleep,</p>
<p>self induced therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trauma therapy,</p>
<p>where you try and divorce the emotion from the experience.</p>
<p>And then you wake up.</p>
<p>And some people also have the other component of REM,</p>
<p>which is atonia, which is paralysis.</p>
<p>Pot smokers experience this a lot more than non pot smokers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an invasion of paralysis into the waking state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a pot smoker, but I have experienced this.</p>
<p>And when you wake up and you&rsquo;re paralyzed for a second,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>But then you jolt yourself alert.</p>
<p>So the REM sleep is important</p>
<p>for kind of the self induced therapy</p>
<p>and forgetting the bad stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for uncoupling the emotions from bad experiences.</p>
<p>And just there are two therapies.</p>
<p>Eye movement desensitization reprocessing,</p>
<p>which is a eye movement thing that shuts down the amygdala</p>
<p>during therapy, not during sleep.</p>
<p>And ketamine, which is a dissociative analgesic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very similar to PCP.</p>
<p>And ketamine is now being used as a trauma therapy</p>
<p>when someone comes into the ER, for instance,</p>
<p>and they were in a terrible car accident.</p>
<p>I mean, these are horrible things to describe it.</p>
<p>They saw a relative impaled</p>
<p>on the steering column or something.</p>
<p>And they will give this drug</p>
<p>to try and shut off the emotion system</p>
<p>so that, because they&rsquo;re not gonna forget,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be honest, you don&rsquo;t forget the bad stuff,</p>
<p>but it is possible to uncouple the bad events</p>
<p>from the emotional system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all sorts of ethical issues</p>
<p>about whether or not that&rsquo;s good or bad to do.</p>
<p>But PTSD is a failure to uncouple the emotion</p>
<p>from these intense experiences.</p>
<p>So the goal of this kind of therapy</p>
<p>is in the uncoupling for that to be permanent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To separate.</p>
<p>So they can recount the event</p>
<p>and they can describe it</p>
<p>without it triggering the same somatic experience</p>
<p>of terror and dread,</p>
<p>because terror, those feelings can be debilitating,</p>
<p>obviously.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying physiologically,</p>
<p>in REM sleep, a similar process is happening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Thematically, REM sleep is about experiencing</p>
<p>or replaying intense emotions</p>
<p>without experiencing the somatic,</p>
<p>the physical component of the emotion,</p>
<p>either the acting out</p>
<p>or the accelerated heart rate and agitation.</p>
<p>Likewise with things like ketamine therapies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re uncoupling the physical sensation</p>
<p>from the mental events.</p>
<p>What is REM sleep and why is it so special?</p>
<p>Maybe we can comment on that.</p>
<p>Rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, discovered in the 50s at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intense brain activity,</p>
<p>high levels of metabolic activity,</p>
<p>dreams in which people report a lot of the theory of mind.</p>
<p>We were talking about Simon Baron Cohen.</p>
<p>Theory of mind was actually something</p>
<p>that he developed for the diagnosis of autism.</p>
<p>If you take kids, most kids of age five, six, seven,</p>
<p>put them in front of a TV screen in the laboratory</p>
<p>and you have them watch a video</p>
<p>where a kid is playing with a ball or a doll.</p>
<p>And then the kid puts it into a drawer,</p>
<p>shuts the drawer and walks away.</p>
<p>And another kid comes in and you ask the child</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s observing this little movie,</p>
<p>you say, what does this second child think?</p>
<p>And a typical kid would say,</p>
<p>they want to play and they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the ball or doll is,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re upset or they&rsquo;re sad, they want the doll.</p>
<p>Autistic children tend to say the doll&rsquo;s in the drawer.</p>
<p>The toy is in the drawer.</p>
<p>They tend to fixate.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t get on the event.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t get into the mind of that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a theory of mind.</p>
<p>Dreams in REM have a heavy theory of mind component.</p>
<p>People are after me trying to get me.</p>
<p>You can assign motive to other people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid, but it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s an expectation.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t tend to happen in slow wave sleep dreams.</p>
<p>Now, all this of course is by waking people up</p>
<p>and asking them what they were dreaming about,</p>
<p>which from a standpoint of a AI guy</p>
<p>or a machine learning or a neuroscientist kind of like,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the best we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>But brain imaging in waking states</p>
<p>while people view a movie</p>
<p>and then brain imaging while people are sleeping</p>
<p>supports the idea that that&rsquo;s basically what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So REM sleep is amazing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to get much of it</p>
<p>during your bout with Goggins,</p>
<p>but you will afterward.</p>
<p>Why, so to comment, why won&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>So is it not possible to get into it real quick?</p>
<p>Only if you&rsquo;re very, very sleep deprived,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re going to be at high muscular output,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to bias you</p>
<p>towards more slow wave sleep overall.</p>
<p>And your body and brain are smart.</p>
<p>They, it will know,</p>
<p>they will know that your main goal is to recover</p>
<p>so you can keep going.</p>
<p>So you can keep firing neuromuscular contractions</p>
<p>and you can keep running so that you can,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing to think like, why do we ever stop?</p>
<p>Unlike weight training</p>
<p>where I can&rsquo;t do a 500 pound deadlift, I just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I could train for it,</p>
<p>but I certainly can&rsquo;t do a 600 pound, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>What causes us to stop an endurance event</p>
<p>is usually not a physical barrier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost always a purely mental barrier.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very interesting problem.</p>
<p>I mean, neuroscientists don&rsquo;t tend to think about</p>
<p>those sorts of problems</p>
<p>because it sounds so non neuroscientific,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s fundamentally related to the question of,</p>
<p>what is pursuit?</p>
<p>What is the desire to push and to carry on?</p>
<p>Is there a neuroscientific answer</p>
<p>for that question you think?</p>
<p>I think the closest thing is this paper</p>
<p>from Janelia Farms, the Howard Hughes campus,</p>
<p>showing that if you put animals</p>
<p>into a simulated environment</p>
<p>where you can measure their effort,</p>
<p>the forces while they&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>and you can control the visual environment,</p>
<p>and you can create a scenario</p>
<p>where the animal thinks that its output is futile.</p>
<p>It knows it&rsquo;s running and it&rsquo;s actually running,</p>
<p>but you change the frequency of the stripes</p>
<p>going by in their visual world,</p>
<p>such that they think they&rsquo;re not getting anywhere,</p>
<p>and eventually they quit.</p>
<p>And the thing that determines whether or not they quit</p>
<p>is a threshold level of epinephrine in the brainstem.</p>
<p>If you drop that level back down</p>
<p>or you give the animals dopamine, essentially,</p>
<p>they keep going.</p>
<p>If you take dopamine down,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, this isn&rsquo;t worth it, it&rsquo;s helpless.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t worth my time and energy.</p>
<p>Well, this is where the difference</p>
<p>between humans and nonhuman animals is interesting,</p>
<p>because it does feel like humans have an extra level</p>
<p>of cognitive ability that might be relevant here.</p>
<p>Well, you can pull from different time references.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in that moment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need a kit of things to pull from.</p>
<p>So you can think this is in honor of someone else</p>
<p>that passed away,</p>
<p>and you will find a gas reserve that&rsquo;s amazing, right?</p>
<p>Now, whether or not mice are like,</p>
<p>I remember my brother back in the other cage</p>
<p>when I was a little mouse, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very likely that they don&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re so present,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in the experience of there and then and now,</p>
<p>that they aren&rsquo;t able to extract from the past,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not able to project into the future,</p>
<p>like how great it&rsquo;s gonna feel</p>
<p>when I get to the end of this really lame VR corridor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they think about that.</p>
<p>And think about like, if I quit now,</p>
<p>how will that have,</p>
<p>what kind of effect will it have on the rest of my life</p>
<p>in the future difficult times?</p>
<p>Like if you allow yourself to quit</p>
<p>in this particular moment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll become a quitter more and more in life,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to not get the other nice,</p>
<p>the opposite sex mammals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty severe, you went there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You took it the whole way to evolution and back again.</p>
<p>I mean, but that&rsquo;s really it.</p>
<p>I mean, our ability to time reference</p>
<p>in the past, present or future.</p>
<p>I do believe that we can be in the present and the past,</p>
<p>or the present and the future, or only in the present,</p>
<p>or only in the future, only in the past.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that we can really think</p>
<p>about past, present and future all at once.</p>
<p>And this has a similarity to covert attention.</p>
<p>Like we can split our visual attention into two things.</p>
<p>We really can do a task, even though we can&rsquo;t multitask.</p>
<p>Or we can bring those two spotlights of attention</p>
<p>to the same location.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very hard to split our attention in really well</p>
<p>into three domains, excuse me, into three domains.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s very, very challenging.</p>
<p>And our time referencing scheme tends to be just one</p>
<p>or two time references.</p>
<p>So Lisa Feldman Barrett, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve done work together,</p>
<p>but at least you&rsquo;re connected.</p>
<p>I found out about her because of you,</p>
<p>on your podcast with her.</p>
<p>And then I brought her on to Instagram,</p>
<p>doing an Instagram live about emotion.</p>
<p>And it was fascinating.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s a very spirited and very, very smart woman.</p>
<p>Fearless and brilliant.</p>
<p>So I love her, she&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>She kind of, she&rsquo;s not a scholar of hallucinogens</p>
<p>or dreams, but she had this intuition</p>
<p>that there may be a connection between the kind</p>
<p>of dissociation that happens in dreaming</p>
<p>and that happens in like psychedelics.</p>
<p>I, because of my previous conversation with you</p>
<p>on this podcast, Matthew Johnson</p>
<p>from Johns Hopkins reached out and he said,</p>
<p>but he commented, I think, on something that we commented</p>
<p>on, I don&rsquo;t even remember exactly what,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s not many studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not being psychedelics and not being rigorously studied</p>
<p>in an academic setting, like with a full rigor of science.</p>
<p>And he said, well, actually that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re extremely well funded now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a long battle to get it accepted</p>
<p>as a serious scientific pursuit.</p>
<p>So, but, and I&rsquo;d like to ask you a little bit about that,</p>
<p>but do you have a sense about connection</p>
<p>between dreams and psychedelics or these different</p>
<p>explorations of mind states that are outside</p>
<p>of the standard normal one, that&rsquo;s the wake mindset?</p>
<p>Yeah, I loved your discussion with Matthew.</p>
<p>I knew of the Hopkins group and the stuff they were doing,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t know much about it at all.</p>
<p>And I learned a ton from that podcast.</p>
<p>I reached out to him just to say,</p>
<p>I love what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So yeah, your podcast has been a great source</p>
<p>of serious academic and intellectual conversation for me.</p>
<p>I think what they&rsquo;re doing at Hopkins is amazing.</p>
<p>He has a collaborator there actually</p>
<p>that had a very popular paper.</p>
<p>I just throw out there for fun,</p>
<p>who is a postdoc at Stanford.</p>
<p>Her name is Gul.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s Turkish, I believe.</p>
<p>And I apologize, her last name escapes me at the moment,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just a function of my brain.</p>
<p>She had a paper showing that she put octopi on MDMA</p>
<p>on ecstasy and found out, this is published</p>
<p>in current biology, it was a great journal,</p>
<p>showing that the octopi then wanted to spend more time</p>
<p>with other octopi and they started cuddling.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re colleagues out there.</p>
<p>But the Hopkins project is super interesting</p>
<p>because I think they were initially supported mainly</p>
<p>through private philanthropy.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re starting to see some more interest</p>
<p>at the level of NIH about psychedelics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated space because the psychedelics</p>
<p>are always looked at through the lens of the 60s</p>
<p>and people losing their mind.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a, I always say,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want a Ken Kesey out of the game.</p>
<p>Ken Kesey was amazing, right,</p>
<p>part of the whole beat generation thing.</p>
<p>And he was actually at the VA near Stanford.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where he eventually, in Menlo Park,</p>
<p>he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest,</p>
<p>or maybe that was about him.</p>
<p>Anyway, the comments will tell me how wrong I am,</p>
<p>but I think I&rsquo;m tossing these words</p>
<p>in the right general direction.</p>
<p>But Huxley, Kesey, they did a lot of LSD</p>
<p>and they all lost their jobs, right?</p>
<p>They lost their jobs at big institutions</p>
<p>like Harvard and Stanford and elsewhere, or they left</p>
<p>because they made themselves the experiments.</p>
<p>Hopkins, as far as I know, is one of the first places,</p>
<p>if not the first place, where whatever Matt</p>
<p>may or may not be doing in his own life, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about the patients</p>
<p>and whether or not the patients</p>
<p>in these institutional review board approved studies,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re getting better</p>
<p>in situations like depression.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s a very close relationship</p>
<p>between hallucinogenic states and dreaming</p>
<p>of the sort that were described for REM dreaming.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a terrific set of books</p>
<p>and body of scientific literature</p>
<p>from a guy named Allan Hobson,</p>
<p>who was an MD, is at Harvard Med,</p>
<p>and he wrote books like Dream Drugstore.</p>
<p>One of the first neuroscience books I ever read</p>
<p>was about hallucinations and how psychedelics</p>
<p>and dreaming are very similar.</p>
<p>That was way back when I was in high school.</p>
<p>I was just curious.</p>
<p>And he really understood the relationship</p>
<p>between LSD and REM dreams and how similar they are.</p>
<p>I think psychedelics, and Matt knows way more about this</p>
<p>than I do, of course, but psychedelics</p>
<p>have some very interesting properties.</p>
<p>They are certainly not for everybody, right?</p>
<p>And kids, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>I think the major issues right now</p>
<p>around the psychedelic conversation is that it&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>that they can unveil certain elements of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>They make the brain amenable to change,</p>
<p>changing up space time relationships,</p>
<p>changing up the emotional load of an event</p>
<p>and being able to reframe that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that happens.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s two major issues.</p>
<p>One is that people talk about plasticity</p>
<p>as if plasticity is the goal,</p>
<p>but plasticity is a state within which</p>
<p>you can direct neurology.</p>
<p>And the question is what changes are you trying to get to?</p>
<p>So people are just taking psychedelics</p>
<p>to unveil plasticity without thinking about</p>
<p>what circuits they want to modify and how.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s great potential, however,</p>
<p>for people opening up these states of plasticity</p>
<p>with psychedelics or otherwise,</p>
<p>and directing the plastic changes</p>
<p>toward a particular end point.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an absolutely spectacular paper</p>
<p>out of UC Davis published as a full article in Nature</p>
<p>just a couple of months ago,</p>
<p>showing that there are psychedelics</p>
<p>that are now can be modified.</p>
<p>So chemists have gotten into the game now</p>
<p>and modifying to take away the hallucinogenic component</p>
<p>where you still get the neuroplasticity components.</p>
<p>And for a lot of people it&rsquo;d be like, oh, that&rsquo;s no fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not giving you the wild experience.</p>
<p>But I do think that that holds great potential</p>
<p>for people that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise orient</p>
<p>towards some of these drugs.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really marvelous what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s about to happen.</p>
<p>And I think there is one drug in that kit of drugs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very unusual, like psilocybin, LSD,</p>
<p>those promote heavy, heavy serotonin release</p>
<p>and lateralized connections ramp up, et cetera.</p>
<p>Matt talked about all that.</p>
<p>But MDMA, ecstasy, is a very unusual situation</p>
<p>where dopamine is very, very high</p>
<p>because of the way the drug is designed.</p>
<p>Dopamine release, it goes through the roof.</p>
<p>So people feel great and they want to move</p>
<p>and they have a lot of energy.</p>
<p>But serotonin levels are also high</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a very unnatural state.</p>
<p>And why MDMA may, and I want to highlight may,</p>
<p>have particularly high potential</p>
<p>for the treatment of certain forms of depression</p>
<p>is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Because never before, as far as we know in human history,</p>
<p>has there been a possibility of opening up dopaminergic</p>
<p>and serotonergic states at the same time,</p>
<p>dopamine being the molecule pursuit and reward</p>
<p>and more and more, and serotonin being one of bliss</p>
<p>and being content right where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like those two things wrap back on themselves</p>
<p>and create this very unusual state.</p>
<p>And I think the bigger conversation</p>
<p>is what to do with a state like that.</p>
<p>Like is it about self love?</p>
<p>Is it about developing love for another person?</p>
<p>Is it about forgetting hate?</p>
<p>Like these are powerful molecules.</p>
<p>And I think if the academic community</p>
<p>and the clinical community is going to move forward</p>
<p>with them in any serious way,</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a conversation</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;re being used for.</p>
<p>Right, and coupled with that,</p>
<p>I think similar to what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>like Matt has talked about,</p>
<p>as others have talked about,</p>
<p>some of the biggest benefits of like progress,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s like quitting smoking</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff is in the days after,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the integration of the experience.</p>
<p>So maybe you open up the brain to the neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s like work to be done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you shake up something in the biology of the brain</p>
<p>but you have to do then it&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Absolutely, a friend of mine who&rsquo;s a physician,</p>
<p>he says, who&rsquo;s quite open to this idea</p>
<p>that psychedelics could play a real role in real medicine.</p>
<p>Says, better living through chemistry</p>
<p>still requires better living.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful statement.</p>
<p>I wish I had said it, but he gets the credit.</p>
<p>But the plasticity window opens.</p>
<p>And then as you said, what are you going to do in the two</p>
<p>weeks, three weeks, four weeks afterward?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the real opportunity.</p>
<p>But those psychedelic experiences are really a case</p>
<p>of an amplified experience inside of an amplified</p>
<p>experience so much so that everything seems relevant.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, my hope is that the AI and machine learning</p>
<p>and the brain machine interface and all that</p>
<p>will eventually be merged with the psychedelic treatments</p>
<p>so that an individual can go in,</p>
<p>take whatever amount of whatever&rsquo;s safe for them,</p>
<p>working with a clinician and really direct the plasticity</p>
<p>while maybe stimulating the medial frontal cortex</p>
<p>or increasing the observer or decreasing the observer</p>
<p>in the brain or decreasing the amygdala.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doable with transcranial magnetic stimulation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s for shutting down activity</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s doable with ultrasound.</p>
<p>Ultrasound now allows very focal activation</p>
<p>of particular brain regions through the skull,</p>
<p>noninvasively.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s approaching the same kind of therapy</p>
<p>from different angles.</p>
<p>One AI is the computational size of injecting</p>
<p>like the robotics injecting like maybe you can even think</p>
<p>about it as like electricity, the electrical approach</p>
<p>versus then like the chemical approach.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then the psychology is subjective, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna take some real understanding</p>
<p>of what that person&rsquo;s lexicon is.</p>
<p>Like, you know, that wasn&rsquo;t a pun, sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s terrible, I&rsquo;m like the worst.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one thing I know from the feedback on my podcast.</p>
<p>My jokes are terrible, but I never claimed to be funny.</p>
<p>But somebody who they really trust</p>
<p>and understands when somebody says, you know,</p>
<p>for a very stoic person, like I&rsquo;m imagining</p>
<p>you interviewed the great Dan Gable, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about Dan,</p>
<p>but can you imagine like you ask Dan,</p>
<p>like, you know, how you feel about something</p>
<p>while on one of these drugs?</p>
<p>And like, I mean, his languaging might,</p>
<p>if he says that was troubling,</p>
<p>it might mean that it was very troubling</p>
<p>or not troubling at all.</p>
<p>So people are, language is a poor guide</p>
<p>because if I say I&rsquo;m upset, how upset is that?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very subjective.</p>
<p>So you need, we need, can you build a tool for that?</p>
<p>Can you build an AI tool for that?</p>
<p>Yeah, deeper, yeah, well.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the eye, maybe that&rsquo;s our,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the eyes could reveal.</p>
<p>So language is not just words, it&rsquo;s everything together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the fascinating things about the eyes</p>
<p>and the window to the soul.</p>
<p>I mean, they express so much, the face, the eyes,</p>
<p>the body, I mean, Lisa talks about that,</p>
<p>the communication of emotions, it&rsquo;s a super complex.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a bit of a side fun tangent,</p>
<p>but Matt, Matthew Johnson brings up DMT</p>
<p>and the experience of DMT is from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p>just a mystery in itself over its intensity</p>
<p>of what happens to the brain.</p>
<p>And of course, Joe Rogan and others bring it up</p>
<p>as a very different special kind of experience</p>
<p>and elves seem to come up often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried DMT, what allows for hallucinogenic states?</p>
<p>And it, I mean, DMT is a really interesting molecule.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people experimenting now with DMT</p>
<p>and the way they&rsquo;ve described it is as a kind of a freight</p>
<p>train through space and time, very different</p>
<p>than the way people describe LSD type experiences</p>
<p>or psilocybin where time and space are very fluid,</p>
<p>but it tends to be a kind of a slower role, if you will.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that DMT is tapping into a brain state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s distinctly different than the other psychedelics.</p>
<p>And you mentioned jujitsu and these other communities.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s interesting because jujitsu</p>
<p>is a nonverbal activity and people get together</p>
<p>and talk about this nonverbal activity</p>
<p>and they show great love for it in the same way</p>
<p>that surfers, I&rsquo;ve known some surfers in my time</p>
<p>and they will get up at the crack of dawn</p>
<p>and drive really, really far to sit in the water</p>
<p>and wait for this wave to come.</p>
<p>I have to imagine it&rsquo;s pretty fantastic.</p>
<p>I think that human beings now,</p>
<p>some of whom are in the scientific community</p>
<p>are starting to feel comfortable enough to talk about</p>
<p>some of these other loves and other endeavors</p>
<p>because they do reveal a certain component</p>
<p>about our underlying neurology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the concept of wordlessness,</p>
<p>activities in which language is just not sufficient</p>
<p>to capture and in which feel so vital as a reset,</p>
<p>as important as sleep.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the dangers of the phone</p>
<p>is not that you&rsquo;re going to get into some online battle</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re always staring at the phone</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a words.</p>
<p>As we read things, we&rsquo;re hearing the script in our head.</p>
<p>And I think getting into states</p>
<p>where we are in a state of wordlessness</p>
<p>is very renewing and replenishing and just can feel amazing.</p>
<p>And I believe also can help us tap into creative states</p>
<p>and allow our neurology to access creative states.</p>
<p>And sleep is one such wordlessness, period.</p>
<p>So one of the most interesting things to me</p>
<p>are states that one can approach in waking,</p>
<p>non sleep depressed, wordlessness through,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s jujitsu, maybe it&rsquo;s for some people surfing,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s dancing, maybe it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, staring at a wall, who knows?</p>
<p>But where the language components of the brain</p>
<p>are completely shut down.</p>
<p>And it has to be the case that drugs are no drugs,</p>
<p>that the brain is entering and starting to states</p>
<p>and starting to use algorithms</p>
<p>that are distinctly different</p>
<p>than when we&rsquo;re trying to compose things</p>
<p>in any kind of coherent way for someone else to understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no interest in anyone else understanding</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re experiencing in that moment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s not just beautiful because it feels good.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beautiful because it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clearly fundamental to our neurology.</p>
<p>And your sense is there&rsquo;s a connection between dreams</p>
<p>and DMT and like psychedelic,</p>
<p>like all of the, you can understand one</p>
<p>by studying the other.</p>
<p>So for example, dreams are also very difficult to study,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re more accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safer to study.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re told we need to get more of it.</p>
<p>Whereas with psychedelics, there&rsquo;s this big question mark.</p>
<p>Is it gonna make everyone crazy?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be legal?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting how,</p>
<p>if one looks on Instagram,</p>
<p>one could almost think that these drugs are already legal</p>
<p>based on the way that people commute, but they&rsquo;re not yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of them are scheduled.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of questions.</p>
<p>I mean, but nevertheless, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>my hope is that science opens up</p>
<p>to these drugs a little bit more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I have this intuition that,</p>
<p>like a lot of people share,</p>
<p>that they would be able to unlock deeper understanding</p>
<p>of our own mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s any kind of, same as studying dreams.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, creativity is in the nonlinearities, right?</p>
<p>But productivity is in the implementation of linearities.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what is absolutely clear.</p>
<p>This is why I think we were talking earlier</p>
<p>about why a formal rigorous training in something</p>
<p>where other people are looking at you</p>
<p>and telling you, no, not good enough,</p>
<p>go back and do it again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s real value to that</p>
<p>because otherwise it&rsquo;s just ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just vapors.</p>
<p>You know, one thing that Matt mentioned</p>
<p>as the study that they&rsquo;re working on is,</p>
<p>as opposed to, I think most of the psychedelic studies</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done is on how to treat different conditions.</p>
<p>And one of the things they&rsquo;re working on now</p>
<p>is to try to do a study where, for creatives,</p>
<p>for people that don&rsquo;t have a condition</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to treat,</p>
<p>but instead see how this,</p>
<p>how psychedelics can help you create.</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>Goodness.</p>
<p>If you take creatives and you give them more psychedelics,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to get out of their room.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, but this is the,</p>
<p>maybe you can speak to that, psychedelics or not,</p>
<p>or dreams or tools in general, how to be better creatives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often see studies of this nature</p>
<p>of like how to take high performers</p>
<p>in the mental creative space</p>
<p>and get them to perform even better.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not average people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like masters of their craft, like taking,</p>
<p>I mean, his examples was taking an Elon Musk,</p>
<p>which is in the engineering space and maybe musicians</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff and studying that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, I mean, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Usually the science, the scientific exploration there</p>
<p>has been done by the musicians themselves,</p>
<p>as has been documented.</p>
<p>Like jazz is like all nonlinearities, right?</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s, but the people still have to know</p>
<p>how to play their instruments, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some early skill building that&rsquo;s critical.</p>
<p>I mean, when you mentioned someone like Elon,</p>
<p>I mean, virtual, I mean, he&rsquo;s already a virtuoso, right?</p>
<p>Cause he, and in so many different domains,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met him, but it&rsquo;s clear, right?</p>
<p>He, it&rsquo;s not just that he&rsquo;s ambitious and bold and brave</p>
<p>and all that, it&rsquo;s all that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s clearly a different way of looking</p>
<p>at the same problems that everyone else is looking at.</p>
<p>And people are probably banging their head</p>
<p>against the refrigerator thinking like, think differently,</p>
<p>think it doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>It involves, there&rsquo;s a certain anxiety in for the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about for Elon, but I don&rsquo;t have no idea.</p>
<p>But I think for somebody who&rsquo;s very structured,</p>
<p>very regimented, very linear,</p>
<p>the anxiety comes from letting go of those linearities.</p>
<p>And for the person that&rsquo;s very creative,</p>
<p>the anxiety comes from trying to impose linearities, right?</p>
<p>The really creative artists or musician, they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they seem nuts.</p>
<p>They seem like they can&rsquo;t get their life together</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they, you know, we look at people who are kind of</p>
<p>pseudo Asperger&rsquo;s or Asperger&rsquo;s or some forms of autism</p>
<p>and they are so hyper linear,</p>
<p>but you take away those linearities and they freak out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the essence of some of those syndromes.</p>
<p>So I think that the ability to toggle back and forth</p>
<p>between those states is what&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>I mean, because we&rsquo;re here and we&rsquo;re having this discussion,</p>
<p>I mean, Steve Jobs is a good example.</p>
<p>He probably the best example,</p>
<p>somebody who actually talked about his own process,</p>
<p>about the merging of art and science,</p>
<p>art and engineering, humanities and science.</p>
<p>Very few people can do that.</p>
<p>Well, you seem to have a capacity to do that.</p>
<p>Like you know poetry and you are AI guy,</p>
<p>like you, there&rsquo;s nothing linear about poetry</p>
<p>as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I mean, I do wonder, just like we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any ways to push that to its limits</p>
<p>to explore further.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like leaning, this is why I&rsquo;m bothered</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not more science and psychedelics is,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done almost,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve eaten mushrooms a few times allegedly,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And the reason I don&rsquo;t do more,</p>
<p>the reason I haven&rsquo;t done DMT is because it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like not well studied.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in those things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not usually at the cutting edge, but I&rsquo;m very curious.</p>
<p>And it feels like there could be tools</p>
<p>to be discovered there, not for fun,</p>
<p>not for recreation, but for like encouraging</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re a linear thinking to go nonlinear</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s nonlinear to go linear, like to shake things up.</p>
<p>You mentioned Dan Gable,</p>
<p>the idea of Dan Gable on psychedelics is fascinating to me</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s such a control freak.</p>
<p>I mean, he likes control.</p>
<p>That I would show up for.</p>
<p>But like so much of these psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>it feels like is for letting go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna resist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s supposedly where the growth is</p>
<p>in giving oneself over to the process.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s for people who are like master controllers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the greatest coaches of all time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to see what that battle looks like</p>
<p>of resistance and then of letting go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I can&rsquo;t wait to see where these studies take us.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s clearly happening.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve asked there,</p>
<p>I have a couple of colleagues at Stanford</p>
<p>who are doing animal studies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked around, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion in the neuroscience community</p>
<p>about what the perception of a laboratory is</p>
<p>if they work on psychedelics.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to tip my hat to the folks at Hopkins.</p>
<p>They are pioneers.</p>
<p>And as Terry Signowski,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a computational neuroscientist down at Salk says,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he was the first person to say it.</p>
<p>He says, you know how to spot the pioneers?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones with the arrows in their backs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s an unkind world to a scientist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to do really cutting edge stuff.</p>
<p>My colleague, David Spiegel who studies medical hypnosis,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got dozens of studies now showing that hypnosis</p>
<p>can be beneficial for pain management,</p>
<p>anxiety management, cancer outcomes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s finally, you know,</p>
<p>at the point where there&rsquo;s so much data,</p>
<p>but people hear hypnosis and they think of stage hypnosis,</p>
<p>which is like the furthest thing from what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And I think mind, body type stuff,</p>
<p>hypnosis, respiration and breathing.</p>
<p>I think the hard science walk into the problem</p>
<p>is always going to be best to get the community on board.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s up to people like Matt</p>
<p>and to really, you know, take it to the next level.</p>
<p>And as I say, not Keezy out of the game</p>
<p>because Keezy basically was taking too much of his own stuff</p>
<p>and he started dressing crazy of banana hats.</p>
<p>And like, you see him, he had the magic bus.</p>
<p>So, you know, the day I start driving to work</p>
<p>in the magic bus, that&rsquo;s the day I lose my job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into buses or wearing fruit, but.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get a phone call from me</p>
<p>and I hope you do the same for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, dude, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s interesting earlier,</p>
<p>we were talking about the challenge with David</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re about to do.</p>
<p>I mean, that is a psychedelic experience of sorts</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re biasing your mind</p>
<p>towards a pretty extreme neurochemical state.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to find there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the excitement,</p>
<p>at least for me as an observer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I want to know what the experience</p>
<p>is like afterward.</p>
<p>I want to know like, how was it?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re going to get something.</p>
<p>Like you said, you&rsquo;re going to grow.</p>
<p>The question is how.</p>
<p>And not resisting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the same as with the psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not like giving yourself over completely</p>
<p>to the experience and not resisting</p>
<p>and going through the whole mental journey</p>
<p>of whether it&rsquo;s anger or excitement or exhaustion,</p>
<p>the whole thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s the entirety of the process</p>
<p>that David goes through when he does his own challenges</p>
<p>and so on is that whole journey.</p>
<p>He finds purposely like missile seeks the limits</p>
<p>of the mind that whenever the resistance is felt,</p>
<p>runs up against it and then goes to the full journey</p>
<p>of going beyond it and seeing what&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>on the other side.</p>
<p>Well, stress has these two sides,</p>
<p>the limbic friction of being tired</p>
<p>and needing to get more energized.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one form of stress.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the feeling too amped up</p>
<p>and needing to calm down.</p>
<p>The typical discussion around stress is one thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all limbic friction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that when I say limbic friction,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a real scientific term.</p>
<p>I just mean the limbic system wanting to pull you down</p>
<p>into sleep or wanting to put you into panic</p>
<p>and you using top down processing,</p>
<p>using that evolved forebrain to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go to sleep</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to freak out.</p>
<p>And those top down control mechanisms are,</p>
<p>I mean, when those get honed, that&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re increasing capacity for everything.</p>
<p>This month on the podcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>You mentioned a bunch already.</p>
<p>Is there something you&rsquo;re looking forward to specifically,</p>
<p>like something maybe you&rsquo;re fascinated by</p>
<p>that jumps to mind about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>this fascinating property of the brain?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that it&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one facet of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that is very well supported by the research data</p>
<p>that hardly anyone has implemented in the real world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the release of acetylcholine from these neurons</p>
<p>in the forebrain called nucleus basalis.</p>
<p>This is mainly the work of Mike Merzenich,</p>
<p>who used to be at UCSF</p>
<p>and some of his scientific offspring,</p>
<p>Greg Reckensown and Michael Kilgard and others.</p>
<p>What they showed was increases in acetylcholine,</p>
<p>this molecule associated with focus,</p>
<p>in concert, meaning at the same time as some event,</p>
<p>motor event or music event or any kind of sensory event,</p>
<p>immediately reorganizes the neocortex</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s a permanent map representation</p>
<p>of that event.</p>
<p>And I absolutely believe that this can be channeled</p>
<p>toward accelerated skill learning.</p>
<p>And my friend and colleague, Eddie Chang,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,</p>
<p>but also a fine scientist in his own right,</p>
<p>not just a clinician,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing studies looking at rapid acquisition of language</p>
<p>using these principles.</p>
<p>He trained with Merzenich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear we have these gates on plasticity</p>
<p>in the forebrain,</p>
<p>and they are gated by nicotinic acetylcholine transmission.</p>
<p>And why that hasn&rsquo;t made it into protocols</p>
<p>for motor learning, sport learning, language learning,</p>
<p>music learning, emotional learning, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think part of the reason has been kind of cultural</p>
<p>is that scientists publish their paper and they move on.</p>
<p>Merzenich talked a lot and still can be found</p>
<p>from time to time talking about</p>
<p>how these plasticity mechanisms can be leveraged.</p>
<p>But he had a commercial company,</p>
<p>and so then people kind of backed away from him a little bit.</p>
<p>I think he was, to be honest,</p>
<p>I think Merzenich was ahead of his time.</p>
<p>And I think the timing is right now</p>
<p>for people to understand these mechanisms of plasticity</p>
<p>and start to implement them.</p>
<p>Also, it all sounds like becoming superhuman</p>
<p>or optimizing or whatever, all that, yes.</p>
<p>But also what about kids with language learning deficits</p>
<p>or with dyslexia or just performance in school in general?</p>
<p>I have a deep, interesting concern</p>
<p>for the future of science and mathematics</p>
<p>and not just in this country, but all over the world.</p>
<p>And more plasticity equals faster, better, deeper learning.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to get the full reach</p>
<p>out of all the machine learning tools either,</p>
<p>because everyone talks about these huge data sets,</p>
<p>but those huge data sets funnel into human interpretation.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t just like stare at the numbers and bask.</p>
<p>So the human brain, I think,</p>
<p>needs to leverage these plasticity mechanisms</p>
<p>to keep up with the thing that&rsquo;s happening very, very fast,</p>
<p>which is technology development.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a long winded way of saying</p>
<p>basal forebrain, cholinergic transmission and plasticity,</p>
<p>it allows for plasticity in adulthood</p>
<p>and it allows for single trial learning, which is incredible.</p>
<p>But how do we leverage that?</p>
<p>Like in the physical space taking actions</p>
<p>or is there some chemicals that can stimulate neuroplasticity?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the intersection of the two.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s being engaged in a physical practice</p>
<p>while enhancing pharmacology.</p>
<p>And it has to be done safely.</p>
<p>And this is full of open questions.</p>
<p>This is the very beginnings of it, like you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, a pill that&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>that increases nicotinic transmission.</p>
<p>I mean, I know a number of people that chew Nicorette.</p>
<p>Actually, I have a Nobel prize winning colleague</p>
<p>at Columbia, not to be named,</p>
<p>who chews like six pieces of Nicorette</p>
<p>in a half hour conversation with him.</p>
<p>And he started doing that as a replacement for smoking</p>
<p>because smoking is nicotine nicotinic stimulation</p>
<p>of the cholinergic system.</p>
<p>So smokers have long known that increases focus</p>
<p>and attention and learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the lung cancer thing is a barrier.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not suggesting people take Nicorette,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear that we need better directed pharmacology.</p>
<p>But you can imagine next time you go in</p>
<p>for a learning bout, if it&rsquo;s really essential,</p>
<p>you might want to stimulate the nicotinic system</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s safe for you.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m a doctor.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not telling people to do this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>Until we start merging machines</p>
<p>with pharmacology and behavior, we&rsquo;re just kind of walking</p>
<p>around in the circle over and over again,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Do you find computer vision, machine learning</p>
<p>from the perspective of tooling as an interesting tool</p>
<p>for analyzing, for processing all the data</p>
<p>from the neuroscience world, from the neurobiology,</p>
<p>biology, all the different data sets</p>
<p>that you could have about the mind, the eye,</p>
<p>the everything that&rsquo;s neck and above,</p>
<p>and also the central nervous system and all?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think that computer science and engineering</p>
<p>and chemistry, bioengineering, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>the acceleration and progress in neuroscience right now.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually one place where science,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very reassured, science has invited in psychologists,</p>
<p>computational biologists, at least at Stanford, MIT,</p>
<p>and other places too, of course, it&rsquo;s clear</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a everyone&rsquo;s invited kind of party right now.</p>
<p>That the major issue in the field of neuroscience,</p>
<p>at least through my view,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no conceptual leadership.</p>
<p>No one is saying we need to work on</p>
<p>and solve this problem or that problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very fragmented right now.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is people are communicating.</p>
<p>So computer scientists and people who work on AI,</p>
<p>machine vision are talking to biologists and vice versa,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very dispersed.</p>
<p>Is there a lot of different data sets in your work</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve just come across?</p>
<p>Is there a huge number of disparate data sets</p>
<p>around neuroscience and so on?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of cell sequencing stuff.</p>
<p>So the Broad over in Boston and then on this coast,</p>
<p>the Chen Zuckerberg Initiative,</p>
<p>they did $3 billion to sequence every cell type</p>
<p>in humans and in animals and I think their goal</p>
<p>is to cure every disease by some date,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, in the future.</p>
<p>Huge data sets of gene expression and protein expression,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>I think no one really knows how to think</p>
<p>about neural circuits and what is a neural circuit?</p>
<p>Is it one structure?</p>
<p>Is it two structures communicating?</p>
<p>I think this is where I actually think</p>
<p>that the robotics is going to tell us how the brain works</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s tempting to think that the brain</p>
<p>has all these cell types and circuits</p>
<p>in order to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>But it might be that the fundamental algorithm</p>
<p>is to create cells and circuits</p>
<p>that can solve variable problems.</p>
<p>We know in the retina, just a very simple example</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve always heard about like cones</p>
<p>are for color vision and high acuity</p>
<p>and rods are for night vision and non color vision.</p>
<p>But at the dusk, dawn transition,</p>
<p>certain cell types switch to do completely different,</p>
<p>have a completely different function</p>
<p>for viewing starry night</p>
<p>versus what they do during the daytime.</p>
<p>So neurons multiplex.</p>
<p>And I think building machines that can multiplex</p>
<p>and can evolve themselves is going to help us</p>
<p>really understand what the brain is doing.</p>
<p>We need to tease out the fundamental algorithms.</p>
<p>We know they&rsquo;re like motion detection</p>
<p>and spatial vision and things like that.</p>
<p>I think machines are going to be much faster at that</p>
<p>than our understanding of biology</p>
<p>and how the brain does that.</p>
<p>Basically, I&rsquo;ll be out of a job</p>
<p>and people like you will have a job.</p>
<p>Well, no, I think the main idea is that</p>
<p>there won&rsquo;t be a job that&rsquo;s machine learning</p>
<p>or computer vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a tool that neuroscientists</p>
<p>will use more and more and more</p>
<p>and biologists would use.</p>
<p>I mean, this whole idea that it will just be a tool</p>
<p>that allows you to start expanding</p>
<p>the kind of things you can study.</p>
<p>Well, the next generation coming up,</p>
<p>I can say this because I now I&rsquo;m blessed</p>
<p>to have a bioengineering student.</p>
<p>They think about problems so differently than biologists do.</p>
<p>We realized the other day we both came up</p>
<p>with a set of ideas around a certain project</p>
<p>and we realized that her version of it</p>
<p>was the exact opposite of mine.</p>
<p>And hers was far more rational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an engineering perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why would we do that last?</p>
<p>We should do that first.</p>
<p>I think that the next generation is really interested</p>
<p>in solving practical problems.</p>
<p>So a lot like computer science and engineering was</p>
<p>in the late nineties, it was like,</p>
<p>you can go do a PhD in computer science and engineering,</p>
<p>maybe, or you go work for a company</p>
<p>and actually build stuff that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>I think neuroscientists and people interested</p>
<p>in neuroscience are starting to think,</p>
<p>how can I build stuff that&rsquo;s useful?</p>
<p>And this statement is supported by the fact</p>
<p>that many people in my business leave their academic labs,</p>
<p>fortunately not all of them,</p>
<p>but they leave their academic labs</p>
<p>and they go work for companies like Neuralink.</p>
<p>This is something I think we&rsquo;ve spoken a few times offline</p>
<p>about, I mean, speaking of computer vision,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the eye.</p>
<p>I did a bunch of work on the eye.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the neuroscientists,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a neurobiology way of studying the eye,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the computer vision way of studying the eye.</p>
<p>And the computer vision way of studying the eye</p>
<p>of just like observing, noncontext sensing of humans</p>
<p>is really fascinating to me</p>
<p>and studying human behavior in different contexts,</p>
<p>like in semi autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>it seemed like there&rsquo;s a lot of signal</p>
<p>that comes from the eye, that comes from blinking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not fully understood yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been in the lab, it&rsquo;s been used quite a bit</p>
<p>to study like the dilation of the pupil,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things are used to infer workload,</p>
<p>cognitive load, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But the pictures is murky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not completely well understood,</p>
<p>especially in the wild, how much signal you can get</p>
<p>from the eye, from the human face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve downloaded Joe Rogan&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>all of the podcasts he&rsquo;s ever done, video.</p>
<p>You have the YouTube bank.</p>
<p>I have the YouTube bank for a reason</p>
<p>that this was before he went with Spotify.</p>
<p>You own the archive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s PubMed, and then there&rsquo;s the Joe Rogan experience</p>
<p>owned by, or maintained by Lex.</p>
<p>For my private collection.</p>
<p>No, the reason I did it,</p>
<p>and I did a really rigorous processing of it,</p>
<p>which is like I extracted all of the faces,</p>
<p>I did the really good blink track,</p>
<p>the pupil tracking and the blink detection</p>
<p>for the entirety of the,</p>
<p>oh, I should say it&rsquo;s from episode like,</p>
<p>I forget what it is, but it&rsquo;s like episode 900</p>
<p>when they switched to 1080p video.</p>
<p>But it was like much crappier video.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still kind of.</p>
<p>Did you log when there was marijuana consumption</p>
<p>or when they were drinking?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s gonna, like just,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t throw off the data,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s relevant to the pupil data.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just put it this way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating</p>
<p>computer vision problems involved,</p>
<p>but I only kept long sequences of data</p>
<p>where the eyes detected exceptionally well.</p>
<p>And I also removed people that were wearing glasses.</p>
<p>I removed, there&rsquo;s certain people that have a way</p>
<p>of moving their eyes and squinting</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s harder to infer like concrete blinks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll kind of have a squint the whole time.</p>
<p>And their blink is very light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tough to know what&rsquo;s an actual blink.</p>
<p>So I wanted to.</p>
<p>Then you got those baseball cap wearing guys.</p>
<p>There are certain people that go on podcasts</p>
<p>and wear baseball caps and don&rsquo;t reveal their,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they realize it or not until it comes out,</p>
<p>but their face is completely obscured from vision.</p>
<p>And from a computer vision perspective,</p>
<p>people that wear makeup and usually women on their eyes,</p>
<p>it complicates things.</p>
<p>Like eyelashes all complicate things.</p>
<p>So you can clean stuff up</p>
<p>just so you have really crisp signal.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, you can deal with issues,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many hours of Joe Rogan video.</p>
<p>Anyway, I say all that because I was searching</p>
<p>for an interesting personal experiment for me</p>
<p>because I saw in drivers when I was looking</p>
<p>at eye movement in drivers, it seemed to indicate,</p>
<p>there seemed to be quite a lot of signal there</p>
<p>that indicates amount of cognitive load,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not clear if there&rsquo;s something conclusive,</p>
<p>but if there is some signal, that&rsquo;s a really powerful one</p>
<p>because eye movement can be detected in the wild.</p>
<p>Like you and I sitting here,</p>
<p>I can detect eye movement really well.</p>
<p>Pupil dilation is a really crappy indicator.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s luminance dependent.</p>
<p>Like if I turn toward a light, it&rsquo;s a route.</p>
<p>People change size depending on level of alertness,</p>
<p>arouse autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>but also overall levels of luminance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very hard, but there are,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re sitting on a gold mine</p>
<p>because there is a lot of interest right now</p>
<p>in measuring state through noncontact sensing.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability through changes in skin tone,</p>
<p>just off a camera.</p>
<p>Can you imagine that at the point where</p>
<p>you just look at some video and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;re getting more stressed or worked up</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not based on a heat map</p>
<p>of some little patch on their face.</p>
<p>Cause everyone&rsquo;s going to have this slight,</p>
<p>sort of compartmentalize it slightly differently,</p>
<p>but you can learn it pretty quickly.</p>
<p>We know this when someone&rsquo;s like giving a talk</p>
<p>and we see them starting to blotching on their neck.</p>
<p>This is like the thesis defense response, right?</p>
<p>We know it and it&rsquo;s a stressful situation</p>
<p>because not passing your thesis defense is rough.</p>
<p>And we can see that,</p>
<p>but cameras can pick that up really easily</p>
<p>at much lower levels than the blatant blotching</p>
<p>kind of effect.</p>
<p>And eye movements certainly are powerful indications</p>
<p>of the state of the autonomic system.</p>
<p>So do you think there are things from a high level</p>
<p>that you can pick up from eye movement and blinking?</p>
<p>Well, blink frequency is going to increase</p>
<p>as people get tired, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been teased a lot online</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t blink much when I&rsquo;ll do a post.</p>
<p>And so I did a whole post about blinking,</p>
<p>about the science of blinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some data, very strong data, not from my lab</p>
<p>that show that every time you blink,</p>
<p>it resets your perception of time.</p>
<p>They have people do these kind of track</p>
<p>a kind of a Doppler like thing.</p>
<p>And anyway, blinking resets your perception of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dopaminergic mechanism</p>
<p>in the blink related circuitry of the brain.</p>
<p>When people are very alert,</p>
<p>they tend to not blink very much.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re sleepy, we tend to blink more</p>
<p>and our eyes tend to close.</p>
<p>Now, some people are more hooded</p>
<p>in the way their eyes sit.</p>
<p>Some people are like this all the time.</p>
<p>There are some very famous people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna name them</p>
<p>because I might run into them at some point</p>
<p>who were like accused of being sociopaths</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t blink very often.</p>
<p>But they might just have high levels of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t blink very much.</p>
<p>Also depends on how lubricated the eyes are.</p>
<p>So I think within individual,</p>
<p>you can get a lot of information.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can say this person&rsquo;s blinking a lot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re lying, this person or they&rsquo;re tired.</p>
<p>This person doesn&rsquo;t blink, they&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<p>I think if you understand that person&rsquo;s baseline,</p>
<p>you can get it.</p>
<p>And presumably, well, having been</p>
<p>on the Joe Rogan Experience,</p>
<p>I can say when you first sit down there,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve never been in there before.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in my data set by the way.</p>
<p>Oh my.</p>
<p>Well, I bet you I will admit to being,</p>
<p>first time sitting down there.</p>
<p>I mean, Joe was incredibly gracious,</p>
<p>made me feel very comfortable there.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s an intense experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small space too.</p>
<p>Anytime you enter a small space from a big space</p>
<p>in his old studio, you&rsquo;re familiar with,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a breaking in period</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re getting to know somebody.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m sure my levels of autonomic arousal</p>
<p>front of the podcast were higher than later.</p>
<p>But once you have a baseline established,</p>
<p>you can get a lot of data on somebody simply from blinks.</p>
<p>Some people averting gaze too.</p>
<p>If you have both people, that&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>This is the holy grail, another holy grail of neuroscience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mainly looked at subjects in isolation.</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been much brain imaging</p>
<p>of two people interacting</p>
<p>or even in animal models of two mice</p>
<p>or two monkeys interacting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all like person scanner, bite bar.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;ve ever been in one of these scanners,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like in a bite bar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very medieval.</p>
<p>And so you think in the interaction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually, you can almost study them</p>
<p>as a single brain or as a single system.</p>
<p>The two brains are a single system.</p>
<p>I think with AI.</p>
<p>Highly correlated.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe are your blinks triggering my blinks?</p>
<p>Are your non blink epochs extending my non blink epochs?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating space to explore there</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s done it.</p>
<p>And because everyone let the Joe Rogan experience archive</p>
<p>disappear, except for you.</p>
<p>You grabbed, did you get the comments too?</p>
<p>Because I think the comments were almost as entertaining</p>
<p>as the conversation.</p>
<p>You know what you just made me realize with the couplings,</p>
<p>I have a better data set than the Joe Rogan podcast</p>
<p>with high resolution video,</p>
<p>which is the raw video for this podcast.</p>
<p>So for example, both cameras right now are recording</p>
<p>you and I full feed.</p>
<p>The final result will switch cameras back and forth,</p>
<p>but I have the full feed.</p>
<p>So I can have the blinking for both you and I</p>
<p>the whole time.</p>
<p>I bet you people trigger blinks and in one another,</p>
<p>you know, and there&rsquo;s also like the simplest way</p>
<p>to think about the blinks and the attentional thing</p>
<p>and the alertness is two fighters in the standoff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole lore around who blinks first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they blink first.</p>
<p>Well, what are we really asking?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking whether or not one person can maintain focus</p>
<p>longer than the other person,</p>
<p>which is an important parameter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only parameter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an important parameter.</p>
<p>And so that blinking contest,</p>
<p>even though they don&rsquo;t square off as a blinking contest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s well known that the first to blink</p>
<p>is revealing something about their capacity</p>
<p>to hold attention.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve started an amazing podcast</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve mentioned a few times.</p>
<p>People should definitely check it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>It does your, it&rsquo;s basically,</p>
<p>it embodies the personality of Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>which is like make science accessible,</p>
<p>but also fascinating and giving it,</p>
<p>like what do you call it?</p>
<p>You give tools for everyday life,</p>
<p>meaning it kind of grounds it like,</p>
<p>what the hell does this mean for my life?</p>
<p>But then also does the beauty of science at the same time.</p>
<p>So I love both the rigor and the openness</p>
<p>of the whole thing,</p>
<p>plus the whole corrections things that we mentioned.</p>
<p>Anyway, what&rsquo;s been the hardest part of this whole process?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of, already one of the only,</p>
<p>and one of the best science broadcasters out there.</p>
<p>So in that process, what&rsquo;s been the hardest,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s been the most exciting part?</p>
<p>Wow, well, first of all,</p>
<p>thanks for the kind words about the podcast.</p>
<p>It was inspired by you.</p>
<p>I absolutely, that&rsquo;s no BS.</p>
<p>The last time we met to do an interview for your podcast,</p>
<p>we talked a little bit about it</p>
<p>and you gave me the subtle nudge</p>
<p>that maybe there was a podcast there</p>
<p>and I thought about it and I laughed</p>
<p>and I was just like, I gotta do this thing.</p>
<p>And you really gave me the encouragement to do it.</p>
<p>And your podcast, this podcast has really forged the way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been tip of the spear on serious scientific,</p>
<p>intellectual, yet fun, accessible conversation.</p>
<p>And so I, as your colleague and friend,</p>
<p>but just even if those things weren&rsquo;t true,</p>
<p>like this podcast was and is the inspiration.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really, like 100%.</p>
<p>And when I decided to do the podcast,</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>I thought really long and hard about what would work best</p>
<p>and would be most beneficial.</p>
<p>It turned out to be the hardest thing,</p>
<p>which is to stay on a single topic</p>
<p>for three or four or more episodes</p>
<p>before switching to a new topic.</p>
<p>Because I know from the experience of university</p>
<p>and teaching in university, as you know as well,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s always the temptation</p>
<p>to pivot to something else,</p>
<p>but the drilling into something really deeply</p>
<p>is where the gems reside.</p>
<p>And the challenge has been how to make it interesting,</p>
<p>how to keep people on board,</p>
<p>how to give people tools along the way,</p>
<p>but also stay close to the scientific data.</p>
<p>I like to think that we&rsquo;re headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>It still needs to evolve, but that&rsquo;s been a challenge.</p>
<p>I think I also am challenged by the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a tremendous range of backgrounds of listeners.</p>
<p>So some people have asked for more names,</p>
<p>like more bits and parts of the nervous system</p>
<p>and cellular molecular mechanisms</p>
<p>and all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And other people have said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand any of that stuff,</p>
<p>but I think I&rsquo;m keeping up.</p>
<p>And so unlike a university course</p>
<p>where there are prerequisites</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s coming to the table</p>
<p>with more or less the same knowledge,</p>
<p>I have a very limited sense of what the audience knows</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I incorporated the feature</p>
<p>of the comment section on YouTube,</p>
<p>being a source of feedback.</p>
<p>And I do kind of an office hours like episode</p>
<p>every third or fourth episode</p>
<p>where I address common questions.</p>
<p>And I think that the podcast space in my mind,</p>
<p>at least for the sort of podcasts I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>needed a venue for the listeners</p>
<p>to be a more integral part of the experience</p>
<p>as opposed to just commenting</p>
<p>on what they liked or didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So while I like to hear what people liked and didn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I also really like to hear about,</p>
<p>hey, tell me more about temperature minimums</p>
<p>and how they can be used to phase shifts</p>
<p>or cadient rhythms or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And I realized that I&rsquo;m probably losing</p>
<p>some people along the way,</p>
<p>but hopefully at the end of each month,</p>
<p>and because of the way that the episodes are archived,</p>
<p>people will come away feeling as if they&rsquo;ve learned a ton</p>
<p>and they have tools that they can implement.</p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re starting to think scientifically</p>
<p>about the tons of other stuff that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been the challenge and it&rsquo;s still really early</p>
<p>days, but, and of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also an intentional challenge.</p>
<p>I realize that people are busy.</p>
<p>Not everyone has two hours to listen to a podcast</p>
<p>about jet lag and shift work and raising kids</p>
<p>and sleep and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not raising kids,</p>
<p>but I did a whole thing about babies and sleep with,</p>
<p>you know, and how parents can manage their sleep</p>
<p>when kids aren&rsquo;t sleeping.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been, I&rsquo;m hacking through the jungle</p>
<p>of all this stuff, but, and I&rsquo;ll come right back to it.</p>
<p>My inspiration and my North star on this is getting</p>
<p>to a point where the audience that listens to this feels</p>
<p>the same way that I do when I listen to your podcast.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Like when I turn into your podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to embarrass you a little bit more</p>
<p>by complimenting you a little bit more,</p>
<p>but not out of a sadistic thing,</p>
<p>but just because when I tune into your podcast</p>
<p>or Joe&rsquo;s podcast, I have the same sensation</p>
<p>that other people have.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like I&rsquo;m home of sorts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m familiar with the space</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like people to feel comfortable in the space</p>
<p>that is the Huber and Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>whatever that ends up being.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the magic of podcasting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I feel like I&rsquo;m part of your life now</p>
<p>in a way that, as a fan, that I wouldn&rsquo;t be otherwise.</p>
<p>And, you know, like I never was able to have that</p>
<p>with Carl Sagan, for example, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a whole nother level of connection</p>
<p>with a human being that gets you excited.</p>
<p>And then I share your excitement</p>
<p>about different topics in neuroscience</p>
<p>or just biology in general.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t have to actually understand</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;re saying to really enjoy it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the magic of podcasting is like,</p>
<p>you can go through like 10 minutes</p>
<p>and not understanding what the hell a person is saying,</p>
<p>and then you enjoy the excitement</p>
<p>and then you reconnect to a thing</p>
<p>that you do understand what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s, that personal coupled</p>
<p>with the scientific rigor is magic.</p>
<p>And finding the right, it&rsquo;s exploration.</p>
<p>Like Joe found something that works for comedians,</p>
<p>which is like, you know, having a good laugh,</p>
<p>but also every once in a while talking seriously</p>
<p>about difficult topics.</p>
<p>The scientific space, it was unclear.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t had guests on.</p>
<p>Not yet, but maybe you&rsquo;ll come on as our first guest.</p>
<p>I was gonna invite my,</p>
<p>I was gonna try to force myself in there.</p>
<p>I am, I&rsquo;m officially inviting you now.</p>
<p>Will you come on the podcast?</p>
<p>I would love to, I would love to.</p>
<p>But it was hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a little bit difficult to tell people</p>
<p>that no, you don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna talk for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna talk for three or four hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different, for scientists,</p>
<p>for like, they&rsquo;re like, what are we gonna talk about?</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s like the NPR interview.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t realize, first of all,</p>
<p>I think at his best, if you&rsquo;re like at the level</p>
<p>of Joe Rogan, who I think is an excellent conversationalist,</p>
<p>you just lose track of time.</p>
<p>It can be three, four, five hours</p>
<p>and you lose track of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not there.</p>
<p>I find that it&rsquo;s still painful.</p>
<p>Like the conversation is still challenging sometimes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t lose quite as much of track of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still an intellectual effort.</p>
<p>And I think it might always be as it would be with you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re talking about difficult topics,</p>
<p>maybe that require more brain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just shooting the shit with like a Brian Red Band</p>
<p>or somebody like comedians or just joking.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like, remember those shows,</p>
<p>like where those shows where someone would come out</p>
<p>and like spin plates and they&rsquo;re running back and forth.</p>
<p>Really good scientific discussion is like that.</p>
<p>You have to be maintaining three or four</p>
<p>different logical arguments and jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s occasionally get into like a real streak of linearity.</p>
<p>But as we found today that typically there&rsquo;s three</p>
<p>or four different things that we&rsquo;re bouncing back</p>
<p>and forth from.</p>
<p>And that requires a lot of updating of these,</p>
<p>you know, forebrain circuits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a passive listening experience.</p>
<p>But I like to think that the brain likes that.</p>
<p>I do want to ask just cause we all,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to forget the question came up to me</p>
<p>is your podcast has the same kind of rigor</p>
<p>that I think like a Dan Carlin podcast has</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a history podcaster.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a definitely a compliment.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s way, you know, he&rsquo;s something for me to aspire to.</p>
<p>He goes through hell to prepare.</p>
<p>He spends months preparing.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;ve had to really prepare for your podcast.</p>
<p>I definitely prepare hard.</p>
<p>How does that?</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, how much effort does that take?</p>
<p>It feels like a conference presentation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we record once a week and in the intervening time,</p>
<p>I listened to many university level lectures.</p>
<p>So NIH has a bank of lectures.</p>
<p>I have some sources of recorded university seminars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find the points of intersection.</p>
<p>So like for four episodes on sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to just regurgitate a popular book</p>
<p>or take one lecture and just poach the content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find the overlap in the different elements.</p>
<p>I also, so what I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll generally read 10</p>
<p>or 15 papers and generally those are good reviews,</p>
<p>annual reviews, any review of neuroscience,</p>
<p>annual review of physiology, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll chase a few references.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to some YouTube videos,</p>
<p>but of university level lectures.</p>
<p>And then I throw all that on a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Usually while I work out in the morning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just be working out.</p>
<p>I have a gym in my house</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just put up all these random ideas.</p>
<p>I want to cover that dreams, hallucination.</p>
<p>And then I take that and I start to eliminate,</p>
<p>I draw lines between the common points of intersection.</p>
<p>And then from that, I distill out an outline.</p>
<p>And then I basically think about what I want to say</p>
<p>on my walks with my dog.</p>
<p>And I bother a couple of people and blab to them.</p>
<p>So I would say each podcast, yeah,</p>
<p>I put in 10 to 15 hours at least</p>
<p>of passive listening preparation</p>
<p>and maybe five or six of active preparation.</p>
<p>So I do prepare quite a lot,</p>
<p>but it has a certain reward component for me.</p>
<p>To come up at the end with something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somewhat crystallized for me is just so satisfying.</p>
<p>It feel like there&rsquo;s something about my dopamine circuits</p>
<p>that just love that.</p>
<p>And the only pain is that a year later</p>
<p>after I&rsquo;ve talked about the stuff a bunch of times,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much more succinct, but that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>At some point you got to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know what you think,</p>
<p>but for me, YouTube is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sad that Joe left YouTube.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a archival nature to YouTube that&rsquo;s kind of magical.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m really glad you&rsquo;re now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a lot of educational content on Instagram</p>
<p>and Instagram before,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m doing this podcasting on YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like Feynman lectures.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not saying every podcast,</p>
<p>but there will be, you will have some,</p>
<p>I could already tell there&rsquo;ll be some lectures</p>
<p>which are like definitive, like really special ones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hope.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some aspect that&rsquo;s archival to YouTube</p>
<p>where at least I hope like 20 years from now,</p>
<p>some kid is gonna watch a lecture of yours</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll create the next Nobel prize, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll create another dream that then becomes a reality.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s a special thing that YouTube provides.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really excited that you&rsquo;re on YouTube.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see where this thing goes</p>
<p>because it seems like change is the cliche thing,</p>
<p>that change is the only constant in these times</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re paving with this podcast,</p>
<p>with this creativity, what you were doing on Instagram</p>
<p>as well, you&rsquo;re paving the new era</p>
<p>of what it means to do science.</p>
<p>So actively doing research</p>
<p>and actively explaining that research in new media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely inspired by you.</p>
<p>We had this discussion last time</p>
<p>after the podcast recording,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear that communication of science</p>
<p>cannot be left to the existing institutions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about universities.</p>
<p>I just mean that the science section of newspapers is,</p>
<p>sometimes there&rsquo;s some gems there,</p>
<p>but generally it goes, you know?</p>
<p>And I think you really have to know a field</p>
<p>in order to extract the best things from that field.</p>
<p>And my hope is that other practicing scientists</p>
<p>and people finishing their PhD and postdoc</p>
<p>and people who are running labs or working at companies</p>
<p>will start to do this.</p>
<p>I mean, how amazing would it be, for instance,</p>
<p>if someone at Neuralink was giving us hints</p>
<p>about not necessarily what they&rsquo;re developing</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s complicated for all sorts of reasons,</p>
<p>but would talk to us about what the real challenges</p>
<p>of building futuristic brain machine interface are like</p>
<p>and what it means to understand a clinical problem</p>
<p>and address it.</p>
<p>I mean, my hope is somebody there might eventually do that,</p>
<p>that somebody in the world of chemistry</p>
<p>or synthetic materials or whatever it is</p>
<p>will do this in a way that I could understand</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have expertise in those.</p>
<p>I think it would be marvelous.</p>
<p>And you were tip of the spear, you were out first,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just happily trying to move along</p>
<p>in the direction I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>But I think the future of science education is online.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s gonna be scary</p>
<p>to a lot of existing institutions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not about disrupting anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about trying to do things better.</p>
<p>Yeah, some of the best interviews,</p>
<p>some of the best investigative journalism</p>
<p>is done by people inside the field.</p>
<p>Comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk,</p>
<p>who I love the possibility that he gets a Pulitzer</p>
<p>for that interview.</p>
<p>But he grilled the crap out of Vlad,</p>
<p>the CEO of Robinhood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar.</p>
<p>Oh, on Clubhouse the other night.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw you guys in there.</p>
<p>I was kept out, I wasn&rsquo;t quick enough.</p>
<p>My thumbs don&rsquo;t go fast enough.</p>
<p>So I was, and I wasn&rsquo;t about to sit in the waiting room.</p>
<p>Have you tried that social network,</p>
<p>by the way, the Clubhouse?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone in there a few times and checked some things out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there, I have a few questions about it</p>
<p>that like if I&rsquo;m in there,</p>
<p>how one can participate or not participate.</p>
<p>I like being a fly on the wall for those conversations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very curious as to what&rsquo;s going on in there.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s quite, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s useful to comment.</p>
<p>I also have a Discord server</p>
<p>that has a few tens of thousands of people on it.</p>
<p>And then they have also a voice chat capability.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these get togethers.</p>
<p>And I was using it in the spring and summer,</p>
<p>like actively on those voice discussions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s anywhere from 10 to like 1,000 people</p>
<p>all together in voice.</p>
<p>Like anyone can speak anytime, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this weird dynamic that people stay quiet.</p>
<p>Only one person speaks at a time</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all like respectful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a community of like fundamentally</p>
<p>respectful people, even though they&rsquo;re all anonymous.</p>
<p>So like, except like me and a few others,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all anonymous people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting and it works.</p>
<p>But the magical thing to me about that community</p>
<p>was how intimate voice only communication can be.</p>
<p>It felt as intimate as like a small get together</p>
<p>at a home with close friends.</p>
<p>It felt like there&rsquo;s a calmness to it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re revealing things about, you know,</p>
<p>somebody suffering from depression or being suicidal.</p>
<p>So those are the dark things or being super excited,</p>
<p>getting a new girlfriend or boyfriend.</p>
<p>Like just the depth of human experience shared on voice</p>
<p>without video is, I was really surprised</p>
<p>how intimate that is for human connection,</p>
<p>especially in this time of COVID, it replaced that.</p>
<p>So just to give you some context, there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely something there.</p>
<p>One thing that comes to mind is when like in Clubhouse,</p>
<p>you have your little icon.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t actually, you don&rsquo;t see your face moving.</p>
<p>I think when people see their own image,</p>
<p>it puts them in a state of self consciousness</p>
<p>that is eliminated by just having an icon or an avatar.</p>
<p>So like Zoom is dreadful because if I&rsquo;m not used</p>
<p>to talking to people and seeing a little image of myself</p>
<p>staring back at me in the mirror.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, I know there are ways</p>
<p>that you can adjust that, but it&rsquo;s really awful.</p>
<p>And I think that when I get on Zooms now,</p>
<p>I say hello and then I shut down the video component.</p>
<p>And then I just talk in the end.</p>
<p>I come back on just to show that still there, it&rsquo;s still me.</p>
<p>But I think that voice only is really interesting.</p>
<p>Eddie Chang would be an interesting person</p>
<p>to talk to about this because he understands so much</p>
<p>about how inflection communicates</p>
<p>emotionality in deeper state.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a balance between, I think,</p>
<p>just like you said, this is the privacy</p>
<p>somehow allows for the intimacy.</p>
<p>So like being able to, as opposed to putting on an act,</p>
<p>which I realize we do when we&rsquo;re visually</p>
<p>presenting ourselves in remote communication.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s so few places</p>
<p>where people can actually communicate</p>
<p>without the fear of penalty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s woefully absent these days.</p>
<p>And so maybe people are just relieved to be in a place</p>
<p>where they feel like I can say what I want</p>
<p>or not say anything and it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And so Clubhouse, to answer your kind of question is,</p>
<p>there was a big improvement to me over Discord,</p>
<p>which is it has tiers, it has a stage where people,</p>
<p>the person that created the room can invite people up</p>
<p>that would like to speak potentially,</p>
<p>have the opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bigger audience</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t get a chance to speak unless they</p>
<p>click raise their hand and they get called on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a tier system that allows</p>
<p>for there to be a group of like five, 10, 20, 30 people</p>
<p>talking and a lot larger amount in the audience,</p>
<p>which in Discord was the problems that everybody could talk.</p>
<p>And the other thing about Clubhouse is everybody</p>
<p>is strongly encouraged to represent themselves.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re using your real name, it&rsquo;s not anonymous.</p>
<p>And how many people were in that GameStop discussion</p>
<p>the other day?</p>
<p>They currently limit rooms to 5,000.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure maxed out at 5,000.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of overflow rooms.</p>
<p>This is the cool thing about Clubhouse,</p>
<p>really big people were on there all tuned in</p>
<p>and having a conversation, having all from,</p>
<p>all these different worlds being able to connect,</p>
<p>even though without the niceties of like arranging</p>
<p>the meeting, you could just show up and leave,</p>
<p>which is really nice.</p>
<p>But the reason for my lessons from Discord,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to mostly stay away from Clubhouse.</p>
<p>And I think.</p>
<p>Or go in there under another name.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pretend I know the actual, your actual name.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve learned, it&rsquo;s quite addicting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time sink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, the intimacy of it is you find yourself</p>
<p>wasting quite a bit of time on there.</p>
<p>It pulls you in.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>They would in sort of going back to the podcast</p>
<p>or earlier, we&rsquo;re talking about books</p>
<p>or creating a technology.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s absolutely clear is that anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easy to reproduce is probably not worth</p>
<p>much effort and time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, most posts could be easily reproduced.</p>
<p>You just repost them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So now there are some original posts that for which</p>
<p>the attribution goes to the original person</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear it came from you.</p>
<p>But anything that can be easily reproduced is,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really expand us very much as individuals</p>
<p>or as groups.</p>
<p>And most of what I see on social media is stuff</p>
<p>that is purely reproduced.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I think Clubhouse, I mean, it could be</p>
<p>that some real magic emerges on there.</p>
<p>So in moderation could be good.</p>
<p>The magic is, this is another thing that I&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>through COVID that maybe you can think about is live.</p>
<p>I used to be, not understand the appeal of live video</p>
<p>or live connection or like in this Clubhouse live events.</p>
<p>Because Clubhouse is technically, for the most part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not supposed to be recorded.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t record most conversations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one time live event.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a magic to that.</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not captured by like your podcast</p>
<p>or my podcast produced video that&rsquo;s like recorded,</p>
<p>like packaged up.</p>
<p>Well, anything can happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that anything can happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of thing like live concerts.</p>
<p>I definitely, I love live music.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the idea that,</p>
<p>cause you can always listen to the album.</p>
<p>Actually the album usually sounds cleaner and better,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just this idea that anything can happen.</p>
<p>And then you listen to like the parts, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you like a Costello did something weird.</p>
<p>Your dog did something weird.</p>
<p>And then you have to go, God damn it.</p>
<p>You have to go to the kitchen or something to get something.</p>
<p>And then you come back and it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I watched live video like that of people</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be there for the whole time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wait for them to go to the kitchen and come back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I tune out.</p>
<p>And that makes it like a richer experience for some reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Well, it humanizes it.</p>
<p>Yeah, humanizes it.</p>
<p>And I think there is this weird effect of whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a podcast, Instagram or Twitter or anything else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of like two people shouting into a tunnel</p>
<p>and then a bunch of people with ears at the other end</p>
<p>of those tunnels and shouting some things back.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s kind of the format we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll check out Clubhouse again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone in there a few times during the day</p>
<p>and I was surprised to see how many people were in there</p>
<p>in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>I was like, aren&rsquo;t these people supposed to be working?</p>
<p>But maybe that is their work.</p>
<p>Well, be very careful about the time sink of it.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you want to, you and I go together,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a conversation on there.</p>
<p>But one of the things you have to figure out,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t still know how to do it, but how to exit.</p>
<p>Which is like.</p>
<p>And you just do the, isn&rsquo;t there the leave quietly button?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, but like when you and I are on stage</p>
<p>having a conversation, okay, you and I is harder.</p>
<p>But like you really, if it&rsquo;s just you and I,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s the usual human communication of like,</p>
<p>all right, I gotta go.</p>
<p>Like, but when it&rsquo;s like four people,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to interrupt everyone</p>
<p>and announce you&rsquo;re leaving.</p>
<p>You just have to, I mean, there&rsquo;s a weird dynamic</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t quite figured out of.</p>
<p>The etiquette isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>The etiquette is not clear.</p>
<p>Well, the etiquette on different platforms</p>
<p>and how that changes is really interesting.</p>
<p>You know, how YouTube has one etiquette,</p>
<p>which is kind of, it&rsquo;s a lot of harshness is tolerated</p>
<p>on YouTube video comments.</p>
<p>Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram.</p>
<p>Instagram, there&rsquo;s kind of, it seems to be a little.</p>
<p>People are nice.</p>
<p>People are really nice.</p>
<p>People are really nice on Instagram for the most part,</p>
<p>except for those phishing things.</p>
<p>I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account</p>
<p>poached by those copyright.</p>
<p>They come in with those like,</p>
<p>you violated copyright thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of harshness in there</p>
<p>that if you think about it in the real world,</p>
<p>I like to think about Instagram as if it was the real world.</p>
<p>Someone comes over and is basically saying like,</p>
<p>hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get some money out for you?</p>
<p>And like, but there&rsquo;s this trust</p>
<p>based on the format it comes in</p>
<p>that it can almost get past your radar</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re suspicious.</p>
<p>If you took comments, like, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re posting a lot of comments and you said,</p>
<p>you just walk past 500 random people on the street</p>
<p>and just listen to what they say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time for that.</p>
<p>But the comments somehow take on this importance</p>
<p>and this relevance.</p>
<p>And you feel, we feel obligated to give them value, right?</p>
<p>And so the online communities,</p>
<p>the rules really are different.</p>
<p>And they evolve with time, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>With Clubhouse, it&rsquo;s a new social network,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s evolving and people are figuring it out as you go.</p>
<p>And the same thing with podcasting on video</p>
<p>and like scientific podcasting.</p>
<p>This is the cool thing when I look at what you&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning, I&rsquo;m thinking like,</p>
<p>hmm, that&rsquo;s interesting to do it this way.</p>
<p>Because like, I have nobody to copy.</p>
<p>Not many people to copy, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Well, you threw out an idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna put it out here now,</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t wanna,</p>
<p>cause knowing you, you&rsquo;ll hold yourself to it</p>
<p>no matter what.</p>
<p>But when we talked about this issue of the challenge</p>
<p>of staying on a particular topic for a while,</p>
<p>I mean, you do have some cool stuff brewing in there.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s separate from this format.</p>
<p>And I love your interview format,</p>
<p>but when you told me about that,</p>
<p>I got really excited that you might go forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna tell your audience what it is,</p>
<p>but I will say this, it is super cool.</p>
<p>I would have never thought about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distinctly different than what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>or what Lex is currently doing.</p>
<p>And if you decide to do that podcast,</p>
<p>I will be your first and your number one fan.</p>
<p>And I know there are gonna be millions of other people</p>
<p>interested in that.</p>
<p>It would be amazing.</p>
<p>So if you decide to go forward with the idea,</p>
<p>that would be awesome.</p>
<p>I was gonna say what it is,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m not going to because,</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s even more interesting.</p>
<p>I brought up the clubhouse thing actually in Elon,</p>
<p>because I just wanted to get your thoughts</p>
<p>about something he&rsquo;s said a few times to me and in general,</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s under a huge amount of stress.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a startup now</p>
<p>and kind of thinking about all of this.</p>
<p>Cause I enjoy podcasts, I enjoy science,</p>
<p>but he says that his life is basically hell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>He looks happy, but he&rsquo;s probably very good at.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fulfilled.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fulfilled, but the stress levels,</p>
<p>the constant fires that he has to put out.</p>
<p>And he says that most people wouldn&rsquo;t want to be me.</p>
<p>And that basically the reason he does what he does</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s probably something wrong with him.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not, he can&rsquo;t help it, but do that.</p>
<p>Kind of beautiful in a kind of Russian masochistic way.</p>
<p>Well, I just wonder the stress.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine the kind of stress</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s under because, so it&rsquo;s running three plus companies</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s constant, he says that every single meeting</p>
<p>is not about like, should we install a coffee maker</p>
<p>in the kitchen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this rocket is going to blow up</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all fucked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And we have to, you have to fix,</p>
<p>you have to fix real like big problems there.</p>
<p>And like, how do you deal with that?</p>
<p>What do you think about that kind of life?</p>
<p>One, is there a way to walk through that fire?</p>
<p>And two, should you walk through that fire?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, without knowing I&rsquo;ve never met Elon,</p>
<p>but certainly we have common friends in you</p>
<p>and in other people that he worked with long ago</p>
<p>in the PayPal days, all of whom speak very highly of him</p>
<p>and show, express immense admiration</p>
<p>for the number of things that he can maintain.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that he accomplishes more</p>
<p>before 9 a.m. than most people do in a decade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>And that what he does would dissolve most people</p>
<p>into a puddle of tears.</p>
<p>Mostly because of this whole thing</p>
<p>about the brain working hard equates</p>
<p>to thinking about duration path and outcome</p>
<p>and anticipating outcomes given A, B, C, or D,</p>
<p>a lot of very scripted linear thinking and prediction.</p>
<p>And that is hard, it&rsquo;s stressful.</p>
<p>It requires intense neurochemical output.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s doing that for multiple projects.</p>
<p>So presumably he&rsquo;s buffered himself</p>
<p>from the coffee maker issues and the little tiny issues,</p>
<p>but he is himself, unless there&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s walking around in a biological system.</p>
<p>He is.</p>
<p>Yes, allegedly, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, allegedly.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t wanna reveal too much here,</p>
<p>but I have a common coworker and colleague</p>
<p>through some contract work I do that what I can tell you</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s accessing the best resources</p>
<p>in terms of how to optimize his biology.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s thinking about that, not just for himself,</p>
<p>but for all of Neuralink.</p>
<p>Because I think, I&rsquo;m not trying to dodge the question,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s the scale of the individual,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the companies that he&rsquo;s creating.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got people there that you could imagine</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re working at 10% better capacity</p>
<p>or can focus 5% better for 20% of the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at a enormous increase in productivity</p>
<p>and a reduction in the time to reach goals,</p>
<p>which will reduce the amount of stress presumably on Elon,</p>
<p>unless he goes and starts another endeavor.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s certainly not healthy for most people.</p>
<p>It seems to be where he gets his dopamine hits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also really struck by the fact that he has a family</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got kids growing up and a relationship</p>
<p>and all that, so it&rsquo;s super impressive.</p>
<p>I think that, I don&rsquo;t know, how old is Elon?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 40, I mean, pushing 50, I think 48.</p>
<p>Even more impressive.</p>
<p>Because many people who&rsquo;ve been at exceedingly high output</p>
<p>for a decade or more don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>Their system breaks down.</p>
<p>Well, this is what he was saying.</p>
<p>Actually, I mean, I don&rsquo;t listen to all of his interviews,</p>
<p>but on that live on the clubhouse,</p>
<p>he mentioned that he was kind of worried,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting, he was worried that sometimes,</p>
<p>what I think he said is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried that at some point my brain is just going to fail</p>
<p>because of the amount of load it&rsquo;s under,</p>
<p>like how much I have to think through throughout the day,</p>
<p>like how many problems you have to think through.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like puzzles, it&rsquo;s constant puzzle solving.</p>
<p>I would be concerned about taking somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in that regime and suddenly putting them</p>
<p>into a regime where they don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>to bite down into.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my bulldog, Costello,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s happiest when chewing and tugging</p>
<p>at that big old neck of his,</p>
<p>and he is just not going to become a retriever,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not going to, he does well</p>
<p>and gets his dopamine hits from chewing and pulling.</p>
<p>And it seems like Elon has ended up where he is</p>
<p>by way of his natural leanings.</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s a backstory that&rsquo;s trauma based or something,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even begin to think that there is,</p>
<p>it seems that he has,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of those rare individuals in history</p>
<p>that has an immense drive to create</p>
<p>in all these different domains.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying the obvious here,</p>
<p>but it seems like that&rsquo;s what makes him tick.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re doing an awful lot too.</p>
<p>Well, the problem is not really,</p>
<p>the problem is I&rsquo;ve been on the verge</p>
<p>of pulling the trigger on starting a company,</p>
<p>which will increase the workload significantly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m attracted to that because of a dream I have,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit scary</p>
<p>because it can destroy you in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two sources of destruction.</p>
<p>So one source is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, for the first time in my life,</p>
<p>a few months ago, I think,</p>
<p>have gotten, this feels like such a noob thing to say it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve gotten some hate on the internet.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But like, I am such an idiot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so naive to, it was,</p>
<p>I had the question that I guess a lot of people have</p>
<p>when they get hate on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, mom, why are these people</p>
<p>making up stuff about me?</p>
<p>That kind of feeling of like, why are you saying that?</p>
<p>And the reason I mentioned that is like,</p>
<p>well, if you wanna go and start a business</p>
<p>and do, as I think people should</p>
<p>when they start a big, ambitious business,</p>
<p>really try to go big.</p>
<p>Like, what does success look like</p>
<p>in terms of your emotional journey?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a lot of people</p>
<p>who make up stuff about you,</p>
<p>who say negative things.</p>
<p>I mean, majority, hopefully, if you do a good job,</p>
<p>will be supportive and,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still going to be this army of people there.</p>
<p>And like, that was scary to me</p>
<p>because of how much emotional impact that had on me.</p>
<p>Well, and I also know a little bit,</p>
<p>I have some glimpse into the fact</p>
<p>that you put your heart and soul into everything you do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a, you&rsquo;re lighthearted about certain things,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re even lighthearted</p>
<p>about being full gas pedal 24 seven.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of this,</p>
<p>Laird Hamilton always says,</p>
<p>the big wave surfers, he always says,</p>
<p>bright light, dark shadow.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s that intensity.</p>
<p>And when you do that,</p>
<p>and then suddenly people are starting to like,</p>
<p>throw some paint on your picture,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, wait, hold on, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going max capacity.</p>
<p>But I think the company is interesting one</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve talked about doing this company before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been afraid.</p>
<p>I just not been pulling the trigger out of fear</p>
<p>because I enjoy this life.</p>
<p>This is, it&rsquo;s starting to interrupt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately this question of taking a leap is like,</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re in academia, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re at MIT,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, I really love doing research at MIT.</p>
<p>I really love that life.</p>
<p>Why take a leap out?</p>
<p>You know, but I did because it&rsquo;s been a dream,</p>
<p>but now accidentally along the way,</p>
<p>I found this podcasting thing,</p>
<p>which is also really fulfilling.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s like, why take a leap?</p>
<p>Cause you have a huge lust for life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes when I&rsquo;m on the internet</p>
<p>and I think, is this, you hear about it like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s addicting, you know, YouTube&rsquo;s addicting all that.</p>
<p>Actually, sometimes I think maybe that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but a lot of times I just think there&rsquo;s so much here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of garbage,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many gems out there in the world now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, sure how you allocate time is key,</p>
<p>but I think you can do it all.</p>
<p>Not, maybe not five more things, but all.</p>
<p>And one thing, I just had this idea</p>
<p>and this is not grounded in any scientific paper,</p>
<p>but I think the answer might come to you</p>
<p>during this torture that you&rsquo;re about to get yourself</p>
<p>through with David, because in those mental states,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really asking the question, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking the question, where is my capacity?</p>
<p>And am I even close to my capacity?</p>
<p>And if I am, what&rsquo;s of the most value?</p>
<p>I think we find the answers to those things</p>
<p>in those nonverbal, nonanalytic states.</p>
<p>It just comes to us.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right, and I hope it&rsquo;s a profoundly</p>
<p>fulfilling experience as opposed to one</p>
<p>that leads to my demise, but.</p>
<p>You have a will, right?</p>
<p>It all goes to the hedgehog.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, to the hedgehog.</p>
<p>Now it all makes sense.</p>
<p>Andrew, like we talked about offline and on this podcast,</p>
<p>I do hope we write some stuff together,</p>
<p>do some research together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the most inspiring scientists,</p>
<p>speaking of communicating to the world.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do with the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already a huge fan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been telling everybody about it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see you talk to Joe as well soon.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t wait to see what kind of paper</p>
<p>we write together.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you, that project&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait, and thanks again for having me on.</p>
<p>Appreciate you, brother.</p>
