    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 18, Keeping Time with the Romans.</p>
<p>The last time we looked at the emergence of the ancient Celts who once dominated much</p>
<p>of Central and Western Europe, and we looked at the defeat of those same Celts by the Romans</p>
<p>in the region known as Gaul, which is basically modern day France.</p>
<p>And the Latin dialect spoken in that region eventually evolved into an early form of French</p>
<p>known as Old French, and it was this version of French which the Normans brought with them</p>
<p>to England in 1066 and which radically transformed English into the language we have today.</p>
<p>Now this time I want to talk about time, or at least the Roman concept of time, because</p>
<p>not only do many of our time-related terms come from Latin, but also because it helps</p>
<p>to illustrate how the language of the Romans permeates modern English, and it also makes</p>
<p>for some good etymology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s return to where we left off last time, with Roman Gaul, the region that would</p>
<p>eventually become known as France.</p>
<p>And at this point in our story, Gaul was a newly conquered Roman territory, and the conqueror</p>
<p>was Julius Caesar, and Caesar was also now the dictator of what would soon become the</p>
<p>Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Now Julius Caesar was an historical figure who has impacted the English language in many</p>
<p>ways.</p>
<p>His name exists in modern English as the medical procedure known as the Caesarean section,</p>
<p>or C-section, and this is supposedly because Caesar himself was born by this method.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s probably a myth, because during the time of Caesar, babies were only</p>
<p>surgically removed from the womb when the mother died in childbirth.</p>
<p>And Roman medicine wasn&rsquo;t capable of surgically removing a baby the way modern medicine can,</p>
<p>so it was basically a last-ditch effort to save a baby when the mother died or was destined</p>
<p>to die in childbirth.</p>
<p>But Caesar&rsquo;s mother was alive during Caesar&rsquo;s lifetime, according to recorded sources.</p>
<p>So Caesar himself was apparently not born by that method.</p>
<p>Now some historians have noted that Caesar had a somewhat prominent relative who was</p>
<p>also named Julius Caesar, and this other Julius Caesar was apparently born by that method.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some speculation that the similarity of the names caused the confusion, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why the Caesarean has generally been attributed to the more famous Caesar.</p>
<p>Now I should note that the modern English pronunciation of Julius Caesar is quite different</p>
<p>from the way the name would have been pronounced in Latin during the time of Caesar.</p>
<p>And I mention this in part because a few listeners with a background in Latin have asked me about</p>
<p>the name of the god Jupiter.</p>
<p>In an earlier episode, I noted that the name of the god Jupiter developed from an original</p>
<p>Indo-European word meaning Sky Father.</p>
<p>Now technically, classical Latin didn&rsquo;t have the J sound.</p>
<p>So Jupiter was pronounced Jupiter during the period of Latin.</p>
<p>And the Y sound in Jupiter was represented by the letter I.</p>
<p>And the same was true of the name Julius.</p>
<p>It was actually pronounced Julius during the period of classical Latin, and again it was</p>
<p>spelled I-U-L-I-U-S.</p>
<p>The J sound actually developed in very late Latin, beyond the classical Latin period.</p>
<p>And one place where it developed was in Gaul.</p>
<p>Now many parts of the Roman Empire had a local Latin dialect, which are sometimes called</p>
<p>vulgar Latin dialects because they were the dialects of the common people of that region.</p>
<p>And those dialects weren&rsquo;t the standard Latin dialect of the classical period.</p>
<p>And in Gaul, the Latin dialect developed several new sounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already discussed in an earlier episode how the K sound began to shift to an S sound</p>
<p>before certain letters.</p>
<p>And the H sound also began to disappear from the language, which is why we still sometimes</p>
<p>have silent H&rsquo;s in words borrowed from Latin.</p>
<p>And the Y sound began to shift to a brand new J sound in many words.</p>
<p>So Jupiter became Jupiter.</p>
<p>And Julius became Julius.</p>
<p>Now these changes were part of the transition from late Latin into a very early form of</p>
<p>French called Old French.</p>
<p>And these changes would be further impacted by the arrival of a Germanic tribe called</p>
<p>the Franks, who would eventually oversee the transition of Gaul into the Frankish Kingdom</p>
<p>and then eventually into the nation we know today as France.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all much later in our story.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how Julius became Julius.</p>
<p>But what about Caesar?</p>
<p>Well, during the period of classical Latin, Caesar was actually pronounced Kaiser.</p>
<p>Remember that the C always had the K sound in Latin.</p>
<p>And as I just noted, the K sound shifted to an S sound before an E and an I in Old French.</p>
<p>So from Julius Kaiser to Julius Caesar, we can hear the impact of sound changes in late</p>
<p>Latin and early French.</p>
<p>And we can see how those changes impacted modern English.</p>
<p>Modern English may not sound like French, but the way many English words are pronounced</p>
<p>is a direct inheritance from French.</p>
<p>And it also starts to explain why many English spellings can seem so random and complicated.</p>
<p>Now after Caesar&rsquo;s assassination, the name Caesar was adopted as a general name for Roman</p>
<p>emperors.</p>
<p>So Rome actually had many Caesars after Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And because of the heavy influence of the Romans, the term Caesar passed into German</p>
<p>and Russian as well, where it also meant the top military or political leader.</p>
<p>Remember Caesar was pronounced Kaiser in classical Latin.</p>
<p>So the term passed into German as Kaiser.</p>
<p>And it was still in use in the Austro-Hungarian Empire until World War I.</p>
<p>And the term passed into Russian as Tsar.</p>
<p>And it too was in use in Russia as late as the 20th century.</p>
<p>Now the term Tsar has also been borrowed into English as a term for certain top political</p>
<p>leaders.</p>
<p>So the drug Tsar in the United States is the person responsible for enforcing U.S. drug</p>
<p>laws.</p>
<p>Again, drug Tsar literally means drug Caesar in its original sense.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s something else that we typically associate with Julius Caesar, and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Julian calendar.</p>
<p>This calendar was developed at the instruction of Caesar, and it&rsquo;s the direct ancestor of</p>
<p>the calendar we use today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about time and how the ancients measured it.</p>
<p>Last time I discussed the ancient Celts, and I explained how Caesar conquered the Celtic</p>
<p>territory of Gaul.</p>
<p>And I mentioned that the ancient Celts didn&rsquo;t have a written language, and that&rsquo;s generally</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>But as the Celts began to encounter other literate people, like the Greeks and the Romans,</p>
<p>it does appear that they began to adopt some very early limited writing, like for inscriptions.</p>
<p>And this occurred around the same time the Romans invaded Gaul.</p>
<p>Now Caesar actually noted that the Celtic tribes had adopted some very limited writing</p>
<p>for inscriptions.</p>
<p>And this was all confirmed about 150 years ago when the remains of a Celtic calendar</p>
<p>dating from the 1st century B.C. was discovered in France, which, as we now know, was once</p>
<p>the Roman territory of Gaul.</p>
<p>So given that date, the 1st century B.C., it means the calendar was being used by Celts</p>
<p>in Gaul around the same time Caesar invaded the territory.</p>
<p>And the writing on the calendar used Roman lettering and numerals, but it was written</p>
<p>entirely in a Celtic dialect.</p>
<p>The calendar highlights several dates which were important to the Celts for ceremonial</p>
<p>or agricultural purposes, or perhaps for both.</p>
<p>And that makes it the oldest surviving document in a Celtic language.</p>
<p>And it confirms that the Celts were not the barbarians the Romans considered them to be.</p>
<p>And as I said, the calendar predates the Roman occupation, and it shows a sophisticated series</p>
<p>of astronomical calculations, which is completely independent of the calendar developed by the</p>
<p>Romans.</p>
<p>Now, I mention this Celtic calendar for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, to make the point that shortly before the languages of the continental Celts died</p>
<p>out, they had begun to adopt some limited writing for inscriptions and notations.</p>
<p>But the other reason is to talk about the importance of ancient calendars and timekeeping.</p>
<p>Many of our modern English words related to dates and timekeeping come from the Romans.</p>
<p>In fact, many of them come directly from Julius Caesar himself.</p>
<p>For example, the name of the month of July comes directly from the name Julius in Julius</p>
<p>Caesar.</p>
<p>And as I said earlier, the so-called Julian calendar comes from certain reforms to the</p>
<p>calendar implemented by Caesar himself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look at that ancient Roman calendar.</p>
<p>Now in ancient times, the most important measurements of time were days, months, and years.</p>
<p>I mean, today we spend a lot of time focusing on hours and seconds and minutes, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>largely a product of modern technology and our fast-paced culture.</p>
<p>But to the ancients, it was much more important to keep track of days and months and years.</p>
<p>Seasonal measurements were essential to an agricultural society.</p>
<p>Determining when to plant and when to harvest was essential for survival in these ancient</p>
<p>societies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why ancient monuments like Stonehenge, which predate both the ancient Celts and the</p>
<p>Romans by many centuries, it probably had an astrological function, at least in part.</p>
<p>And seasonal measurements were also important for military purposes.</p>
<p>Military campaigns were avoided in the colder climates of Europe during the winter months.</p>
<p>So the three basic forms of time measurement for ancient people, again, were days, months,</p>
<p>and years.</p>
<p>Now, a day is very simple.</p>
<p>As we know, that&rsquo;s the length of time it takes for the earth to make one complete rotation</p>
<p>on its axis.</p>
<p>Or as the ancients would have viewed it, the length of time it takes for the sun to make</p>
<p>one complete revolution around the earth.</p>
<p>So since the day was measured by the perceived movement of the sun, the sun was closely associated</p>
<p>with the concept of a day.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European word for sky was something like dyu.</p>
<p>This word also meant to shine, like sunshine.</p>
<p>So it came to be associated with the concept of a day.</p>
<p>And you may remember this word as part of the original Indo-European word for God, which</p>
<p>was sky-father.</p>
<p>It produced the Sanskrit word dƒÅyaspitƒÅr.</p>
<p>It also produced the Greek word zuspetr, which was later shortened to Zeus.</p>
<p>And it also produced the name of the Anglo-Saxon god Teu, which gave us Tuesday, another time-related</p>
<p>term, but more on that later.</p>
<p>And that same original Indo-European word produced the Latin word diupatr, which became</p>
<p>Jupiter, and then Jupiter in Late Latin and Early French, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Well, this Indo-European word for sky or shine, dyu, it ultimately produced two other words</p>
<p>in Latin.</p>
<p>One word was deus, which came to be a generic term for God.</p>
<p>And we see that word in modern English, in words borrowed from Latin, for example in</p>
<p>words like deity and divine, and even in the French word adieu, which literally meant to</p>
<p>God and came to mean, God be with you, as a standard way of saying goodbye.</p>
<p>The other word which developed in Latin from that original Indo-European word dyu was deus.</p>
<p>And that word meant day in Latin.</p>
<p>So there you can see how the original Indo-European word for sky or shine developed the Latin</p>
<p>words for both God and day.</p>
<p>Now with regard to the Latin word for day, which remember was deus, it produced modern</p>
<p>English words like diary, which was a journal of the day&rsquo;s events.</p>
<p>And it produced a word like dial, as in part of a sundial that marks the daylight hours.</p>
<p>And it produced the word diet, which is how much you ate each day.</p>
<p>And it also produced the word adjourn, which meant to put off to another day.</p>
<p>Now during the Middle Ages, it was common for calendars to set aside two days of each</p>
<p>month, so 24 days total for the year, as evil days or unlucky days.</p>
<p>In Latin, the term evil day was dies malus, combining the Latin word dies for day and</p>
<p>malus for evil.</p>
<p>Well an evil day, or dies malus, became anglicized during the period of Middle English and it</p>
<p>became known as the dismal days.</p>
<p>And from this we get the modern English adjective dismal, meaning dreary or unfortunate.</p>
<p>So the Latin word deus meant day.</p>
<p>So did the modern English word day come from this Latin word deus?</p>
<p>Well according to most modern linguists, the answer is actually no.</p>
<p>The English word day comes from an old English word, deia, which had a different Indo-European</p>
<p>root.</p>
<p>And you may think there&rsquo;s a connection between the English word day and the word date, but</p>
<p>again linguists tell us that each of those words are not actually cognate.</p>
<p>The word date comes from a Latin word unrelated to those I&rsquo;ve already mentioned and having</p>
<p>an altogether different Indo-European root.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve discussed the ancient concept of a day, which was directly connected to the concept</p>
<p>of the sun and the sky and sunshine or daylight.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider the concept of a month.</p>
<p>And as you might suspect, just as a day is connected to the sun, a month is connected</p>
<p>to the moon.</p>
<p>A month was based on the movement of the moon around the earth.</p>
<p>Specifically, one complete orbit of the moon around the earth represented a month.</p>
<p>And for the ancients, this cycle was based on observing the changing phases of the moon.</p>
<p>So from one new moon to the next, you had a month.</p>
<p>Now we can easily see the connection of moon and month in modern English because both words</p>
<p>come to us from Old English and they both ultimately come from the same Indo-European</p>
<p>root.</p>
<p>The Indo-European root word was mensis and it produced the original Germanic word menin</p>
<p>for moon and meneth for month.</p>
<p>And that Germanic language gave us the Old English word muna for moon and munath for</p>
<p>month.</p>
<p>So moon and month have a direct lineage and they still closely resemble each other because</p>
<p>they both come to us via the same sources, Indo-European to Germanic to Old English to</p>
<p>Middle English and then to Modern English.</p>
<p>Words that do that tend to maintain a close resemblance over time.</p>
<p>And we still see that in those two words, month and moon.</p>
<p>Now Latin also developed a word from that same original Indo-European root word mensis</p>
<p>and the Latin word was very similar, pronounced mensis.</p>
<p>And this word is the root of menstruate and menstrual in Modern English, again referring</p>
<p>to a monthly cycle.</p>
<p>The Romans also used this word mensis to represent a period of six months.</p>
<p>They combined the Latin word for six, which was sex, with the word mensis to create the</p>
<p>word semester, which originally meant a period of six months or half a year.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s evolved in Modern English to mean half of a school year.</p>
<p>So month, moon, menstrual, and semester are all cognate.</p>
<p>All relate back to the original Indo-European word for moon.</p>
<p>But Latin also developed a separate word for moon.</p>
<p>And that other word is actually the more familiar Latin word in Modern English.</p>
<p>That word was luna, which gives us the Modern English word lunar, as in lunar eclipse or</p>
<p>lunar phase or, as we&rsquo;ll see shortly, lunar calendar.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a direct connection between the Latin words mensis and luna, both meaning</p>
<p>moon.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the ancient Romans had a moon goddess named Luna.</p>
<p>So the Romans eventually associated the term luna with the moon itself.</p>
<p>And so luna came to refer to the moon and things associated with the moon.</p>
<p>Now this Latin word also came from an original Indo-European word, which was something like</p>
<p>leuc, and meant light or brightness.</p>
<p>And this Indo-European root word gave us a Germanic word, which came into Old English</p>
<p>as leut.</p>
<p>And that is the original version of the word light.</p>
<p>So light came from the same root word, which produced luna in Latin.</p>
<p>And this Indo-European root word, leuc, actually produced several words in Latin.</p>
<p>And from those Latin words we get Modern English words like luster, referring to the way certain</p>
<p>bright things look.</p>
<p>We get lucid, which originally meant shining.</p>
<p>We get illustrate and elucidate, which meant to shine a light on something.</p>
<p>We get translucent, which is something that light can shine through.</p>
<p>We get luminous and illuminate, which again refers to the brightness of something.</p>
<p>And as I said earlier, we get the Latin word luna, which produced both lunar and lunatic.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the connection between lunar and lunatic, you ask?</p>
<p>Well, since the Roman goddess Luna was the goddess of the sphere which was closest to</p>
<p>the earth, the Romans thought that she had a great deal of power.</p>
<p>The phases of the moon were thought to reflect changes in her mood.</p>
<p>And they also thought that her changing mood was responsible for many mental conditions.</p>
<p>So people who acted abnormally or crazy were thought to be under the influence of Luna.</p>
<p>And again, this was thought to be connected to the moon in some way.</p>
<p>So this condition has come to be known as lunacy, and a person who suffers from it is</p>
<p>called a lunatic.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea that the moon makes people a little crazy, it&rsquo;s passed into our modern</p>
<p>culture as well.</p>
<p>We still speak of people acting a little strange on a full moon.</p>
<p>And some of this is an inheritance from the Germanic culture, which had notions which</p>
<p>were very similar to the Romans.</p>
<p>The Germanic culture developed the concept of a werewolf, which was a human who turned</p>
<p>into a wolf on a full moon.</p>
<p>Remember from an earlier episode that the Old English word for man was wer, and a man-wolf</p>
<p>was a werwolf.</p>
<p>And we still have notions of someone going crazy and howling at the moon.</p>
<p>Again, it was a common belief in ancient cultures that the moon affected the mental and psychological</p>
<p>conditions of people.</p>
<p>So we see that reflected in modern English as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked about the connection of a day to the sun and the sky and sunlight.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve discussed the connection of a month to the moon and moonlight.</p>
<p>So what about a year?</p>
<p>Well like a day and a month, a year was based around astronomy.</p>
<p>A year was the length of time it took for the seasons to complete a full cycle.</p>
<p>So in modern astronomical terms, it&rsquo;s the length of time it takes for the earth to make</p>
<p>one complete orbit around the sun.</p>
<p>Now ancient people didn&rsquo;t really understand that the earth moved around the sun.</p>
<p>But they did understand the concept of seasons, like summer, autumn, winter, and spring.</p>
<p>And they understood that those seasons came in regular cycles.</p>
<p>And they were able to measure those cycles by the trajectory of the sun&rsquo;s movement across</p>
<p>the sky at various points during the year.</p>
<p>And also by measuring the length of the days and the nights.</p>
<p>Long days meant more heat and therefore good conditions for planting.</p>
<p>Long nights meant more cold and a time for harvesting and storing food.</p>
<p>And of course the sun&rsquo;s trajectory and the length of the days and nights, they all vary</p>
<p>because the earth is tilted on its axis.</p>
<p>When the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, we get longer days, and thus spring</p>
<p>and summer.</p>
<p>And when the earth moves around the sun as part of its natural orbit, eventually the</p>
<p>earth is located on the opposite side of the sun.</p>
<p>And now the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.</p>
<p>So the days become shorter and we get autumn and winter.</p>
<p>But twice a year, the nine in the day are the exact same length, or almost the exact</p>
<p>same length if you want to be technical.</p>
<p>Now this occurs when the earth reaches the two transition points in its movement around</p>
<p>the sun.</p>
<p>And the Romans called these two dates the equal night, since the night was equal to</p>
<p>the day on those two dates.</p>
<p>The Latin term for equal was equus, and the term for night was nox.</p>
<p>So when those two words were combined, they gave us the word equinox.</p>
<p>Now one equinox occurs in March, and it&rsquo;s called the vernal equinox from the Latin word</p>
<p>ver, which meant spring.</p>
<p>And this marks the point when the days start to become longer than the nights.</p>
<p>So it marks the beginning of spring.</p>
<p>And the other equinox occurs in September, and it marks the transition point at which</p>
<p>the days start to become shorter than the nights.</p>
<p>So in other words, it marks the beginning of autumn.</p>
<p>And this was called the autumnal equinox by the Romans from the Latin word autumnus, meaning</p>
<p>autumn.</p>
<p>Now similar in concept to the equinox was the solstice.</p>
<p>The solstice also occurs twice a year, and it&rsquo;s basically the opposite of an equinox.</p>
<p>The first solstice is the day when the daylight is at its longest, and the night is at its</p>
<p>shortest.</p>
<p>So this longest day of the year occurs in June, and it&rsquo;s called the summer solstice,</p>
<p>and it marks the beginning of summer.</p>
<p>And the other solstice is the day when the daylight is at its shortest, and the night</p>
<p>is at its longest.</p>
<p>And this shortest day of the year is the winter solstice, and it marks the beginning of winter.</p>
<p>Now the trajectory of the sun through the sky, that trajectory moves over the course</p>
<p>of the year.</p>
<p>And on the summer solstice the sun reaches its highest trajectory, and on the winter</p>
<p>solstice the sun reaches its lowest trajectory.</p>
<p>Ancient people could very easily measure the beginning of summer and winter by keeping</p>
<p>track of the sun&rsquo;s trajectory.</p>
<p>And when it reached its height it was summer, and when it reached its lowest it was winter.</p>
<p>On the two dates when it appeared to stop for the day before changing directions, it</p>
<p>was called a solstice, which combined the Latin terms for sun, which was sol, and to</p>
<p>stand still, which was sistera.</p>
<p>Thus since the trajectory of the sun appeared to stand still on those two days before it</p>
<p>changed directions, those days were called a solstice.</p>
<p>So by keeping track of the sun&rsquo;s movement in the sky, and by keeping track of the length</p>
<p>of the days and nights, ancient people could predict the seasons.</p>
<p>So these transition dates were easy to measure, and they were very important.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, for agricultural purposes alone, it told the people when to plant and</p>
<p>when to harvest and when to begin storing food for the winter.</p>
<p>Remember even the Stone Age people who built Stonehenge understood these concepts because</p>
<p>the stones at Stonehenge are arranged in a way that they actually measure the movements</p>
<p>of the sun for these purposes.</p>
<p>And like the Romans who associated the sun with God, the builders of Stonehenge also</p>
<p>apparently used the monument for both astronomical and religious purposes.</p>
<p>And the Celtic Druids who eventually migrated to Britain also recognized this purpose because</p>
<p>they too used Stonehenge for both astronomical and religious purposes.</p>
<p>So we can really see the connections here between the heavens and the ancient concept</p>
<p>of heaven.</p>
<p>Now, even though ancient peoples may not have understood that the earth revolves around</p>
<p>the sun, they did understand how to measure the movement of the sun&rsquo;s trajectory in</p>
<p>the sky, and how to measure the relative length of the days and nights.</p>
<p>And they understood these events occurred at fixed intervals, and that they marked the</p>
<p>changing of the seasons.</p>
<p>So they had a definite concept of a year.</p>
<p>Now the English word year comes from Old English and it actually goes back to the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The Indo-European root word bears a remarkable similarity to the modern English word.</p>
<p>It was something like yer, and it meant year or season in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>It also produced a Greek word hora, which originally meant season in Greek, and it produced</p>
<p>the word horoscope in modern English.</p>
<p>Now the Greek word hora later came to be used to refer to a part of the day, like the</p>
<p>morning or noon or night.</p>
<p>And it eventually evolved into our modern word hour.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>The Greeks had encountered the Babylonians, who were using sundials.</p>
<p>And the sundials were divided into twelve segments.</p>
<p>You might remember from an earlier episode that I mentioned that the Indo-Europeans tended</p>
<p>to count in increments of ten, as is reflected in our modern numbers.</p>
<p>But the Babylonians tended to count in terms of twelves and sixties.</p>
<p>And that tendency was reflected in the Babylonian sundials.</p>
<p>So the daytime was divided into these twelve equal segments on the sundial.</p>
<p>Since these were sundials, they didn&rsquo;t really measure the night time.</p>
<p>So initially it was only the daytime that was divided into twelve segments.</p>
<p>Now the sundial began measuring time at dawn, so that was the first hour.</p>
<p>And that meant that the darkness came at the twelfth hour.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in this sense that we have the term the eleventh hour in modern English, to mean</p>
<p>near the very end or the last opportunity before time runs out.</p>
<p>Now the Greeks had encountered the Babylonians and had borrowed their sundials, and thus</p>
<p>their concept of dividing the day into twelve segments.</p>
<p>And the phrase eleventh hour is actually a phrase used in the book of Matthew in the</p>
<p>New Testament of the Bible.</p>
<p>Remember that the New Testament was written in Greek, and it borrowed the Greek concept</p>
<p>of time, with the twelfth hour being the onset of darkness at night.</p>
<p>So the eleventh hour was nearly at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the origin of the term the eleventh hour in modern English.</p>
<p>Now the Greeks had borrowed the concept of time from the Babylonians, and the Romans</p>
<p>borrowed this same concept from the Greeks.</p>
<p>They also borrowed that Greek word hora, which, remember, came from the same original</p>
<p>Indo-European root word as the modern English word year.</p>
<p>By this point, though, the Romans no longer pronounced the initial h in the word hora,</p>
<p>so it became ora, and eventually, in modern English, became hour.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that Latin eventually lost the h sound, and we see that here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the word hour has that silent h at the beginning, because it was originally</p>
<p>pronounced by the Greeks in the original Greek version of the word.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve already mentioned that the amount of daylight varies throughout the year.</p>
<p>So a Roman hour was merely one twelfth of the daylight, ever how long that was on a</p>
<p>given day.</p>
<p>So an hour was longer in the summer months, since a day was longer then.</p>
<p>And by the same token, an hour was shorter in the winter months, when a day was shorter.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the Middle Ages that the hour was given a precise measurement by allocating</p>
<p>twelve segments to the day, and a corresponding twelve segments to the night.</p>
<p>And these twelve segments thus created twenty-four total segments in the day.</p>
<p>And this created our modern concept of an hour.</p>
<p>This also reflects the movement away from using the sun to measure hours.</p>
<p>As early mechanical watches began to be developed, the sun was no longer needed to measure time.</p>
<p>And this begins the movement toward measuring time more in terms of hours and minutes, rather</p>
<p>than days, years, and months.</p>
<p>So based on the information I just presented, the words year and horoscope and hour are</p>
<p>all cognate, having evolved from the same Indo-European root word.</p>
<p>But again, they get to us in various ways, year coming from the Germanic languages, and</p>
<p>horoscope and hour coming from Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>But again, just like with the word month, which I discussed earlier, the Roman word</p>
<p>for year didn&rsquo;t come from the same root as the English word year.</p>
<p>The Roman word came from a separate Indo-European word, which was at, which meant to go, or</p>
<p>a period gone through, in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>This word at later evolved into the word atnos in an early form of Latin, and then</p>
<p>evolved into the word anus in Classical Latin, and that&rsquo;s the word which the Romans used</p>
<p>for year.</p>
<p>Of course, we get that word in English as annual and anniversary, meaning once a year,</p>
<p>and annuity, which originally meant a sum that was paid yearly.</p>
<p>And in finance, we sometimes calculate interest per annum, which again means per year.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a breather for a second and consider where we are.</p>
<p>So far in this episode, I&rsquo;ve discussed some words which came from the name of Julius Caesar,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve explored the etymology of words which we have related to hours, days, months, and</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>Now I want to put those two together, because as I&rsquo;ve noted earlier, it was Julius Caesar</p>
<p>who oversaw the revision of the Roman calendar, and gave us the roots of the calendar which</p>
<p>we use every day.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion in recent months about the Mayan calendar and the purported</p>
<p>end of the world.</p>
<p>So even if you don&rsquo;t know a lot about keeping time in the ancient past, you probably know</p>
<p>that ancient peoples had many different calendars and many different ways of measuring months</p>
<p>and years.</p>
<p>And I mentioned a Celtic calendar from Gaul earlier in this episode, which had its own</p>
<p>methodology.</p>
<p>So you may wonder why this was all so complicated in ancient times.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t everybody just figure out how to keep track of time?</p>
<p>After all, everybody was measuring time based on these same basic principles.</p>
<p>A day was the period from sunrise to sunrise.</p>
<p>A month was the period from one new moon to the next.</p>
<p>A year was the period from one summer solstice to the next.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone used these same celestial events to keep track of time, so why couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they all get on the same page?</p>
<p>The same calendar page in this case.</p>
<p>Well part of the answer is because these three celestial events, an astronomical day, an</p>
<p>astronomical month, and an astronomical year, they don&rsquo;t divide evenly into each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re three events which we just happen to use to measure time, but none of them fit</p>
<p>neatly and evenly into the others.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most basic form of measurement.</p>
<p>And even in ancient times, everybody generally agreed on what a day was, from sunrise to</p>
<p>sunrise.</p>
<p>But the first problem is that you can&rsquo;t divide an astronomical month into an even number</p>
<p>of days.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no perfect division for a month.</p>
<p>The amount of time it takes the moon to orbit the earth, in other words to experience a</p>
<p>complete moon cycle from new moon to new moon, it&rsquo;s about twenty-nine and a half days.</p>
<p>Now as a practical matter, there was no way ancient people could keep track of a precise</p>
<p>measurement of twenty-nine and a half days.</p>
<p>So they had to round it off to the nearest day.</p>
<p>And that meant if they were counting strictly by days, over a period of many months, the</p>
<p>moon cycles were out of phase.</p>
<p>So they had to readjust from time to time.</p>
<p>And we encounter the same problem when we look at a year.</p>
<p>A year is based on the amount of time it takes the earth to orbit the sun.</p>
<p>But based solely on this factor, one orbit equals three hundred and sixty-five and one</p>
<p>quarter days.</p>
<p>Again, if you round this off to three hundred and sixty-five days, as we do today, then</p>
<p>every four years you have to readjust by adding a day, which we call leap day.</p>
<p>The point here is that the three astronomical events, which were the basis of days, months</p>
<p>and years, are three completely different things, and you can&rsquo;t use one to measure</p>
<p>the others without using complicated fractions, which were impractical in ancient times.</p>
<p>And if you round off to the nearest number, then the measurements soon fall out of line</p>
<p>without constant readjustments.</p>
<p>So these constant fractions and leftover hours and days confounded these early calendar makers.</p>
<p>Yet, as I&rsquo;ve noted, these calculations were very important to people during ancient times.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t plant and harvest crops at the right times, it was often a matter of</p>
<p>life and death.</p>
<p>So early people struggled with the proper calculations for these activities, and they</p>
<p>devised all sorts of calendars to make the necessary adjustments, which were required</p>
<p>to make these numbers reconcile and balance out over time.</p>
<p>So how did the Romans handle this problem?</p>
<p>Well, if we go back to the very beginning of Rome, around the time Rome was founded,</p>
<p>the Romans used a ten lunar month year with an additional winter period that was not even</p>
<p>part of the calendar, so they didn&rsquo;t measure a year by a certain number of days like we</p>
<p>do today.</p>
<p>Instead it was based on a certain number of months, and that&rsquo;s why we call it a lunar</p>
<p>calendar.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at how the Romans did this.</p>
<p>Like many ancient peoples, the Romans kept track of the length of the days, and they</p>
<p>could determine the vernal equinox in spring when the length of the day and the length</p>
<p>of the night were the same.</p>
<p>This marks the beginning of spring, and it was an indicator of the planting season.</p>
<p>So when the vernal equinox occurred, the Romans began counting.</p>
<p>This was the date when their ten-month lunar calendar would begin.</p>
<p>So it ran from modern-day March until around modern-day January.</p>
<p>Then they waited through the undefined winter period, where they were basically off the</p>
<p>grid, until the vernal equinox occurred again, and then they began counting the ten months</p>
<p>all over again.</p>
<p>Now this original ten-month calendar also explains some of the names of the months.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with Latin or any of the Romance languages, you probably recognize</p>
<p>the Latin prefixes of septum for seven, and octo for eight, and novum for nine, and decum</p>
<p>for ten.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve discussed some of those prefixes in earlier episodes, and we see them all the</p>
<p>time in English in words like octopus, for a sea animal with eight legs, and decade,</p>
<p>for a period of ten years.</p>
<p>But September is not the seventh month, it&rsquo;s the ninth month.</p>
<p>And October is not the eighth month, it&rsquo;s the tenth month.</p>
<p>And November is not the ninth month, it&rsquo;s the eleventh.</p>
<p>And December, which is based on the Latin root decum, well, it&rsquo;s not the tenth month,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the twelfth month.</p>
<p>Now part of the reason why these month names seem out of sorts is because the original</p>
<p>Roman calendar only had ten months.</p>
<p>And the names of the last four months were based on the Roman numerals, septum for seven,</p>
<p>octo for eight, novum for nine, and decum for ten.</p>
<p>And those month names became September, October, November, and December.</p>
<p>And those were months seven through ten, and just as today, they were the final four months</p>
<p>of the year.</p>
<p>So in the original Roman calendar, those numbers matched.</p>
<p>But what about the first six months, beginning with the vernal equinox in spring?</p>
<p>Well, the very first month was called Martius, after the Roman god Mars.</p>
<p>Now Mars was originally a god of agriculture before becoming a god of war.</p>
<p>And since the first month came at the beginning of spring, it meant the time for planting</p>
<p>crops and preparing to plant crops.</p>
<p>It was also the month in which military campaigns were often initiated, since the cold weather</p>
<p>was starting to break.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the spring month was named after Mars, since he was the god of both agriculture</p>
<p>and war.</p>
<p>The name of the month became Marsh in Old French, and English took the name from French</p>
<p>after the Norman invasion.</p>
<p>The second month was called Apollos.</p>
<p>Now historians are not certain where this name originated.</p>
<p>Some have suggested an Etruscan origin, with the Greek goddess Aphrodite, or from Apollo,</p>
<p>who also had Etruscan origins.</p>
<p>It became Avril in Old French, and again English took the name from the French after the Norman</p>
<p>invasion and eventually converted it into April.</p>
<p>The third month was called Maias, after the goddess Maia, who was the mother of Mercury</p>
<p>by Jupiter.</p>
<p>It became Mai in Old French, and again English took the name from the French after the Norman</p>
<p>invasion, eventually converting it into May.</p>
<p>The fourth month was called Junius, probably after the god Juno, which eventually became</p>
<p>Juno in late Gallic Latin and early French.</p>
<p>Remember this was the same change that made Julius into Julius and Jupiter into Jupiter,</p>
<p>and the month Junius became Junius.</p>
<p>The name later evolved into June during the Middle English period, again after the Norman</p>
<p>invasion.</p>
<p>So the first four months we still have in Modern English, March, April, May, and June.</p>
<p>And the last four months we also have September, October, November, and December.</p>
<p>But what about the two months in the middle of the original ten-month Roman calendar,</p>
<p>months five and six?</p>
<p>Well those two months used the same Roman numbering system, which was also the basis</p>
<p>of September, October, November, and December.</p>
<p>The fifth month was Quintilis, which was based on the Latin adjective for fifth, which was</p>
<p>quintus, since this was the fifth month at the time.</p>
<p>And the sixth month was Sextilis, which was based on the Latin adjective for sixth, which</p>
<p>was sextus, since again that was the sixth month at the time.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ll see, the names of these two months were eventually replaced.</p>
<p>So today we just pick up the Latin numbering of the months with September.</p>
<p>So that was the original ten-month calendar.</p>
<p>Remember that the Romans basically went off the grid after December when winter kicked</p>
<p>in, and they just waited for the next vernal equinox in spring, and then they just started</p>
<p>counting all over again.</p>
<p>And also remember that these months were based strictly on the cycle of the moon, from one</p>
<p>new moon to the next new moon was a month, so it wasn&rsquo;t really based on a set number</p>
<p>of days.</p>
<p>It was strictly a lunar calendar.</p>
<p>Well, at some point during the Etruscan period, the Romans filled in that winter period with</p>
<p>two additional months.</p>
<p>The first was named Januarius after the god Janus, which at this very early date was the</p>
<p>most important god in the early Roman culture.</p>
<p>Again, thanks to that French J sound, we know the god as Janus today, and the month as January.</p>
<p>Janus was actually much more important than Jupiter, or Jupiter, early on.</p>
<p>But as the Romans encountered the Greeks and they began to align their Roman gods with</p>
<p>the Greek gods, they came to realize that the Greek god Zeus was the preeminent god</p>
<p>in Greece, and the corresponding sky god in Rome, remember, was Jupiter.</p>
<p>So Jupiter got an upgrade thanks to his association with the Greek god Zeus.</p>
<p>But prior to that, Janus, or Janus, was the preeminent Roman god.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why this new winter month was named after him.</p>
<p>The second winter month was named Februarius, and this month was either named for the Roman</p>
<p>god Februs, or a feast of spiritual cleansing called Februa, which was held during this</p>
<p>same period of time each year.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was named after both, but in either case, the name comes to us eventually</p>
<p>as February in modern English.</p>
<p>Now remember that these early Roman months were still based on lunar months, which required</p>
<p>constant revisions to be kept accurate.</p>
<p>This was a lunar calendar, which meant that each month changed when the moon cycles changed.</p>
<p>But that meant that the Romans needed to make constant adjustments by adding days or subtracting</p>
<p>days to keep these lunar months in sequence with the seasons.</p>
<p>Remember that the movement of the moon around the earth is not tied to the movement of the</p>
<p>earth around the sun.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re counting months based on moon cycles, you have to readjust to keep it in</p>
<p>line with the seasons, which are based on the sun.</p>
<p>Now this wasn&rsquo;t a problem originally with that 10-month calendar when the Romans began</p>
<p>each season with the vernal equinox.</p>
<p>At that point, the calendar year was pretty much always in alignment with the seasons.</p>
<p>You just started each year on that date, the vernal equinox.</p>
<p>But now the Romans had filled in that winter gap with two new months.</p>
<p>They were no longer off the grid in winter and allowed to readjust when spring kicked</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>They were now on the grid all year, but they were using moon cycles to determine when the</p>
<p>month changed, not the equinox or solstice.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t making regular adjustments to account for this discrepancy.</p>
<p>Occasionally they did make an adjustment when things were really out of sorts, and since</p>
<p>February was the last month of this early Roman calendar, which began in the spring,</p>
<p>this last month of February was used for adding days to resolve the discrepancies, which is</p>
<p>why we still use it today for adding the leap year every four years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also partially why it has an odd number of days of 28, while the other months have</p>
<p>30 or 31.</p>
<p>Now in 153 BC, the Romans decided to shake things up a bit, and they decided to use January</p>
<p>as the official beginning of the year, since that was when they installed their consuls.</p>
<p>So just as modern businesses can have a fiscal year, which is often different from the calendar</p>
<p>year, the Romans had an official period, which began with the installation of consuls,</p>
<p>and they had this separate calendar year, which began in basically modern day March</p>
<p>in the spring.</p>
<p>So they decided to readjust and just make January the first month since that corresponded</p>
<p>with the beginning of their official or political year.</p>
<p>But this meant that all of those months, which were named after Roman numbers, were now out</p>
<p>of phase.</p>
<p>The fifth month, Quintilis, was now the seventh month, and the sixth month, Sextilis, became</p>
<p>the eighth month, and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how September, October, November, and December went from being months 7, 8,</p>
<p>9, and 10 to months 9, 10, 11, and 12.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s skip forward about a century to the time of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>Remember that the Romans were not making the regular adjustments to the calendar that they</p>
<p>should have been making, and as a result, by the time of Caesar, the whole calendar</p>
<p>was completely out of phase with the seasons.</p>
<p>It was actually an entire season off, so everything was a mess.</p>
<p>So Caesar employed the Greek astronomer, Sicygianus, to come up with a plan to revamp the calendar.</p>
<p>And Sicygianus proposed that they completely abandon the idea of using lunar months, in</p>
<p>other words, the 29 and a half day moon cycles to measure time.</p>
<p>And they decided instead to just convert to a lunar year.</p>
<p>And the lunar year would be 365 days, with a leap year added every four years to account</p>
<p>for the extra six hours which accrued each year.</p>
<p>And keeping with tradition, the extra day would be added to February.</p>
<p>The lunar phases of the moon would cycle through the year, but they would no longer be tied</p>
<p>to any particular month.</p>
<p>And this is the calendar which Caesar adopted on January 1st, 45 BC, and which we still</p>
<p>know today as the Julian calendar.</p>
<p>But two more revisions were later made to the calendar.</p>
<p>In 44 BC, shortly after the assassination of Caesar, the Roman Senate renamed the seventh</p>
<p>month, Quintilis, as Julius, to honor Julius Caesar, who was born in that month.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll recall, Julius became Julius, and it eventually passed into English as July.</p>
<p>And lastly, the eighth month, Sextilis, was renamed as Augustus, in favor of Augustus</p>
<p>Caesar, Julius Caesar&rsquo;s successor and the first emperor of Rome.</p>
<p>Augustus also made its way into modern English as August.</p>
<p>Now a few other minor adjustments were made to the calendar by Pope Gregory VIII in the</p>
<p>1500s, thereby giving us the modern Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>But most of what we know and recognize as the modern calendar came from the reforms</p>
<p>commissioned by Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;ve discussed the names of the months, let me conclude this episode on time</p>
<p>by looking at the days of the week.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve repeatedly expressed the idea that modern English is, at its core, a blend of</p>
<p>Germanic Old English and Latin.</p>
<p>And the way we keep track of time is a perfect example of that blend.</p>
<p>Whereas the names of our months come from Latin, via French, after the Norman invasion,</p>
<p>the names of our days of the week are rooted in the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>But even so, the days were still not immune from Latin influences.</p>
<p>Four days are named after Germanic gods.</p>
<p>One is named after a Roman god, and the other two have origins in Latin but were modified</p>
<p>by the later Germanic Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin with the Greco-Roman astronomer and mathematician Ptolemy.</p>
<p>Now according to Ptolemy, there were seven planets which revolved around the earth.</p>
<p>And those planets were the sun, the moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn.</p>
<p>So the sun and the moon were considered planets at this time.</p>
<p>The idea also probably dates back to the Babylonians.</p>
<p>And during this pre-Christian era, the Romans adopted the seven-day week, and they decided</p>
<p>to name the seven days after these seven planets.</p>
<p>The first day was the sun&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Since sun in Latin was sol, the Latin name for the day was solis deus.</p>
<p>The Germanic tribes took the name, but they substituted the Germanic words for sun and</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>And thus we get Sunday.</p>
<p>The same thing happened for the next day.</p>
<p>The next day was the moon&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>So in Latin, it was lunae deus.</p>
<p>Again, the Germanic tribes simply substituted the Germanic words for the Latin words, thereby</p>
<p>yielding moon&rsquo;s day, or Monday.</p>
<p>Now these two translations were easy, because the Germanic tribes had their own words for</p>
<p>sun and moon.</p>
<p>But the other days were named for planets which were named after Roman gods.</p>
<p>So the Germanic tribes just substituted their own gods.</p>
<p>The next day was named for the planet and Roman god Mars.</p>
<p>We know it in modern French as Mardi, as in Mardi Gras, meaning Fat Tuesday.</p>
<p>Well the Germanic tribes substituted the Roman god Mars with the Germanic god Tyr, or as</p>
<p>the English Saxons knew him, Tew, and we thereby get Tuesday.</p>
<p>The following day was named for the planet and Roman god Mercury, and we know it in modern</p>
<p>French as Mercredi.</p>
<p>But the Germanic tribes substituted Mercury with the Germanic god Odin, or as the English</p>
<p>Saxons knew him, Woden.</p>
<p>So Mercury&rsquo;s day became Woden&rsquo;s day in Old English, and Wednesday today.</p>
<p>And Woden was one of the most important Germanic gods.</p>
<p>When a soldier died in battle, it was believed that they went to Woden&rsquo;s Valhalla in the</p>
<p>afterlife.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk more about Woden and these other Germanic gods when we get to the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>Now the next day of the week was named after the planet and Roman god Jupiter.</p>
<p>In modern French, it is Gerd√©.</p>
<p>The Germanic tribes substituted Jupiter with their god Thor, long before he became a comic</p>
<p>book and movie hero, and the day became Thor&rsquo;s day, hence now known as Thursday.</p>
<p>The next day of the week was named after the planet and Roman goddess Venus.</p>
<p>And being a female god, the Germanic tribes substituted her with Woden&rsquo;s wife, Frigga,</p>
<p>thereby creating the modern Friday.</p>
<p>Frigga was closely associated with another female Germanic goddess, named Freyja.</p>
<p>And it appears that some of the Germanic tribes named the day after her instead.</p>
<p>In Icelandic, for example, Freyja may be the source of the name for their version of Friday.</p>
<p>Some historians believe that these two goddesses may have originally been a single goddess</p>
<p>at some very early point, and that there was a later evolution that divided them into two</p>
<p>separate goddesses.</p>
<p>And this might also account for some of the confusion as to which goddess was used as</p>
<p>the source for the name of Friday in the various Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And that leaves us with the final day, which the Romans named after the planet and god</p>
<p>Saturn.</p>
<p>Now, apparently the Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t have an equivalent god for Saturn, or at least</p>
<p>not one that they wanted to use to make this substitution, so they kept the Roman god Saturn</p>
<p>and we ended up with Saturn&rsquo;s day, or as we know it today, Saturday.</p>
<p>The important point with respect to the names of the week is that these names were adopted</p>
<p>before the Anglo-Saxons migrated to Britain, because names or versions of these names are</p>
<p>found throughout the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So these names were adopted by the Germanic tribes while the Romans were still in control</p>
<p>of Gaul and before the Roman Empire began to collapse.</p>
<p>So these are very old Germanic words which predate Old English.</p>
<p>So I hope you found this discussion of time-related terms interesting.</p>
<p>Not only does it make for some interesting etymology, but it also illustrates how Modern</p>
<p>English is a blend of Germanic and Latin roots.</p>
<p>Now next time, I&rsquo;m going to take a look at the period of the Roman Empire in Western</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explore the Roman invasion of Britain and the growing contact with the Celtic tribes</p>
<p>in Britain.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll also look at the growing Roman contact with the Germanic tribes in Northern and Eastern</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll continue to look at Latin words which have found their way into Modern English.</p>
<p>And after that, I&rsquo;m going to turn our attention to the Germanic tribes themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore the emergence of the Germanic tribes in Northern Europe, and the nature</p>
<p>of the original Germanic language, and the spread of those Germanic tribes into Western</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>And the story of the Germanic tribes will culminate with the migration of the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>into Britain in the 5th century AD.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll bring us to Volume 2 of this podcast series, which will be dedicated to Old English.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
