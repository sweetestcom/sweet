<p>﻿Hey, guys.
Stalling for a minute or so till everyone
logs on.</p>
<p>If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind just letting me know
if you can hear me, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>Can you hear me?</p>
<p>See if that works.</p>
<p>Oh, awesome.</p>
<p>Oh, some people are saying no.</p>
<p>A lot of people are saying yes and no, so
my mic shows that I&rsquo;m on, so you should be</p>
<p>able to hear me.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, if you can&rsquo;t hear me,
what I will do is, this is prerecorded, so,</p>
<p>not prerecorded so we&rsquo;ll upload it and you
can watch it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to give it a couple more minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just playing around with these buttons
here, I see people logging in.</p>
<p>We have about 2500 attendees today.</p>
<p>For some reason, I saw this new button, it
says &lsquo;Request&rsquo; so I&rsquo;m going to upload, it</p>
<p>says &lsquo;Invite as a speaker,&rsquo; so I&rsquo;m just going
to press it and see if I can invite some of</p>
<p>my attendees as speakers.</p>
<p>If you get an invitation, we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>Maybe I could pop you in and we can talk to
you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if that works.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll just give it about 30 more seconds.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>That worked.</p>
<p>Hey, Judy.</p>
<p>Judy: Hi.</p>
<p>Eric Berg: I just pulled you right into my
webinar here, so maybe you could help me,</p>
<p>you can answer any questions as we go through
this, okay?</p>
<p>Judy: Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Eric Berg: Sometimes it&rsquo;s a little difficult
to do a seminar by yourself because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see anyone but at least I see one person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other people here too, that I&rsquo;m
going to invite in.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Welcome to the webinar, everyone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get started.</p>
<p>This is a very vital webinar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on fat burning, and exactly how fat burning
works, so you might want to take some notes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of questions.</p>
<p>I will be more than happy to answer the questions
you&rsquo;re going to have as we go, but try to</p>
<p>make them brief.</p>
<p>It looks like Judy, Judy, could you mute your
microphone for a little bit until I pop you</p>
<p>in?</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Everyone able to do, because there&rsquo;s so many
people I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to affect</p>
<p>the pausing or not, but let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>A lot of you got my emails on my recent webinar
on ketosis, and I really want to cover that</p>
<p>in depth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit complex but I&rsquo;m going to
make it as simple as possible, then I&rsquo;ll answer</p>
<p>any questions that you have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing ketosis for quite a while,
and I use it on clients that have tried everything</p>
<p>and nothing&rsquo;s worked, because a lot of people
are carb-sensitive.</p>
<p>I want to get into the difference paleo and
ketosis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some big differences.</p>
<p>I also want to get into what do you eat long
term.</p>
<p>I think the biggest thing that comes up as
a problem is that it&rsquo;s a red flag, are fats</p>
<p>eating fats okay to eat, are they dangerous
to eat, I want to cover that as well.</p>
<p>I think the worst recommendation that we&rsquo;ve
ever heard is the concept of everything in</p>
<p>moderation, because it allows everything in
moderation, a balance, which you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>get into fat burning if you do that.</p>
<p>That is the worst advice to tell someone,
to have a balanced diet, because that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>Some of the anti-ketosis practitioners out
there, almost every single one of them have</p>
<p>never practiced before in an actual clinical
setting.</p>
<p>They might do research on rats, but they don&rsquo;t
actually practice.</p>
<p>When you work with actual people, over and
over and over, over years and years, you will</p>
<p>find that the whole calorie in, calorie out
model does not work.</p>
<p>Eating less calories than you&rsquo;re burning does
not work, so you have to think outside the</p>
<p>box.</p>
<p>I am totally convinced that the majority of
information being put out by conventional</p>
<p>means is the exact opposite of what you want
to do.</p>
<p>I can prove that, and it just happens over
and over and over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pull up some slides, see if I
can do a screen share here, hopefully I can</p>
<p>do my screen share.</p>
<p>I have all these slides.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me that I can&rsquo;t pull up my &hellip; Well,
that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hang in there for a second.</p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if I can do my screen share.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t that working?</p>
<p>I have all these great slides that I want
to cover.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re just going to keep going here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to, I&rsquo;m going to have to describe
some of these slides.</p>
<p>The first question I want to talk about is,
is ketosis safe?</p>
<p>Is it healthy?</p>
<p>I really think it&rsquo;s one of the healthiest
things you can do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some serious research being done,
or has been done, on ketosis for all sorts</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest thing is for brain and
neural protection of your brain.</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Parkinson&rsquo;s, seizures, things
like that.</p>
<p>So the brain loves this type of fuel called
ketones, which we&rsquo;ll get into describing what</p>
<p>that is.</p>
<p>The state of ketosis is very good for any
type of blood sugar issues.</p>
<p>Diabetes, heart related issues, neurological,
cancer.</p>
<p>The reason why it&rsquo;s good for cancer is because
the cancer cell lives on sugar.</p>
<p>PET scans basically scan the body for certain
parts of your body that are eating up a lot</p>
<p>of sugar.</p>
<p>A cancer cell loves sugar, and if I had cancer
I would completely and utterly eliminate all</p>
<p>my sugars and I would have a much better chance
of surviving.</p>
<p>Respiratory issues, asthma, allergies, acne,
polycystic ovarian syndrome, and especially</p>
<p>weight loss, those are some of the health
benefits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to probably send everyone access
to the slides so you can get all the slides.</p>
<p>I have research studies if you want to look
at, especially ones on cardiovascular that</p>
<p>basically state that when you consume dietary
saturative fats it does not in any way shape</p>
<p>or form increase risk of cardiovascular accidents,
or heart attacks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty powerful stuff because that
goes exactly against what we&rsquo;ve been brainwashed</p>
<p>to think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good for cognitive function and
brain function.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to kind of describe some of these
images that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re dealing with excess stubborn fat,
we&rsquo;re dealing with the problem of stuck energy</p>
<p>in the fat cell.</p>
<p>That is the biggest problem that we have.</p>
<p>I want to move beyond the conventional viewpoint
that all you have to do is balance your calories</p>
<p>and eat less than you&rsquo;re burning and you&rsquo;ll
lose weight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely not true.</p>
<p>Maybe if you&rsquo;re 18 years old, but when you
get 20, 30, 40, you don&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really two fuel sources.</p>
<p>You have the sugar fuel, and we have the fat
fuel.</p>
<p>Fat fuel, you really can only tap into that
when you&rsquo;re in ketosis.</p>
<p>Ketosis is a condition that the body is burning
fat, and it&rsquo;s actually using ketones as a</p>
<p>by-product of fat burning, so ketones are
a fuel source that&rsquo;s very similar function</p>
<p>to glucose, but it&rsquo;s a much cleaner fuel that
has three times as much energy as glucose.</p>
<p>The problem with running on glucose, or sugar,
is that you get high blood sugar and you get</p>
<p>low blood sugar.</p>
<p>The only, the total amount of sugar in your
blood is basically two teaspoons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>If you ever get your blood tested and they
say you have diabetes, or you don&rsquo;t have diabetes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to look at these numbers.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re higher than 100, it&rsquo;s hyper-glycemia
or diabetes, if it&rsquo;s lower than 100 it&rsquo;s hypo-glycemia,</p>
<p>so you want to be 100.</p>
<p>What that 100 means is two teaspoons of sugar
in your blood at any one time.</p>
<p>As you do ketosis, the blood sugars will come
down a little bit, but it won&rsquo;t create a hypo-glycemic</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p>A lot of people oscillate from high sugars
to low sugars, all day long.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what are some of the symptoms
of high blood sugar?</p>
<p>Can you tell me?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I just clicked on a button that someone sent
me.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me, just go ahead and type
in, what symptoms do you get when you everything</p>
<p>high sugar in your blood?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>You get brain fog.</p>
<p>You get tired.</p>
<p>Blurred vision.</p>
<p>You get thirsty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Cold sweats.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>So those are some of the symptoms with hyper-glycemia.</p>
<p>Basically, thirsty, need to urinate often,
dry skin, hungry, blurred vision, fatigue,</p>
<p>brain fog.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s with high sugar.</p>
<p>Now what are the symptoms with low blood sugar?</p>
<p>Does anyone know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called hypo-glycemia.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Shaky, sweating, dizziness, anxiety, irritability,
psychosis, craving for sugar, vision problems,</p>
<p>weak, so they really affect your cognitive
function.</p>
<p>Any time that sugar goes high or low, it just
messes with your physical and mental capacities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why running on ketosis is very therapeutic
for your mood, for your sense of calmness.</p>
<p>For your overall stress.</p>
<p>Because the brain is very greedy.</p>
<p>It basically sucks up &hellip; It&rsquo;s only two percent
of your whole body, but it sucks up 20 percent</p>
<p>of the energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly wanting that sugar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably hear from some people that
the brain only runs on sugar.</p>
<p>Well, it only runs on sugar until you don&rsquo;t
give it sugar.</p>
<p>Then it can switch to ketosis.</p>
<p>So what happens is that your body will not
feed the brain ketones unless there is no</p>
<p>sugar in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>It does convert.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You have a storage of sugar.</p>
<p>Your sugar&rsquo;s mainly stored in the liver and
the muscles.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the muscles first.</p>
<p>The muscle has stored sugar, but it only is
used for the muscles.</p>
<p>The muscle will not give up any of its stored
sugar to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>It will keep it self-contained, so you really
can&rsquo;t use the stored sugar for your muscles</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there to feed your muscles as its sole
purpose.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re left with the liver.</p>
<p>The liver is storing about seven tablespoons
of sugar, enough to last for about 72 hours.</p>
<p>If you ate nothing or no sugar, you would
be dead in 72 hours unless there was a backup</p>
<p>fuel system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your fat.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s cool about this eating plan
is that it really fixes a lot of symptoms</p>
<p>that people have with their cognitive function,
with their memory, with their mood, with anxiety.</p>
<p>Because when these sugars come up and down,
up and down, when you&rsquo;re craving and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungry, that is not the way to live.</p>
<p>In fact there&rsquo;s even a stage three, Type III
diabetes, which affects the brain or memory.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I better define what I mean by diabetes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two types.</p>
<p>Type I is where you don&rsquo;t have enough insulin
from that pancreas, and so the sugar goes</p>
<p>higher and higher, because the purpose of
insulin is to control sugar by lowering sugars,</p>
<p>storing in the fat.</p>
<p>The Type II is that insulin is being produced
but it&rsquo;s not being received into the receptors,</p>
<p>into the liver.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not being listened to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another problem with storage of sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, insulin.</p>
<p>What happens is that the sugars go high, because
the insulin&rsquo;s there but it&rsquo;s not available</p>
<p>to the cells.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both a similar problem, but one&rsquo;s
more advanced.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting some interesting comments here,
that people feel great and lose a lot of weight</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in ketosis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Again, I will send all of you these slides.</p>
<p>I will just send this, because I have your
emails.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Unless you don&rsquo;t have any stored sugar for
over 72 hours, unless you have a good amount</p>
<p>of fat reserves and you know how to do this,
you won&rsquo;t be able to tap into fat.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the big questions, and I want to
see if you guys can get this right.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if what the purpose of fat
is?</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me?</p>
<p>I want to see if anyone can get this correct.</p>
<p>This is a key question.</p>
<p>See if anyone knows the purpose of fat.</p>
<p>And Judy, why don&rsquo;t you put on your mike?</p>
<p>I can see the top of your head, Judy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of fat over there?</p>
<p>Judy: To protect yourself.</p>
<p>Eric Berg: Very close.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely to protect something.</p>
<p>A lot of people say it&rsquo;s like a cushion or
an insulator and that type of thing.</p>
<p>Judy: Yeah.</p>
<p>Eric Berg: Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s not the primary
purpose but thank you for answering that.</p>
<p>If you can put your thing back on mute and
I&rsquo;ll come back to you in a second.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Energy storage, energy&rsquo;s protective fuel,
energy, wow, when you&rsquo;re doing a seminar this</p>
<p>big you have a lot of answers that scroll
pretty fast.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Storage of energy.</p>
<p>Okay, so I have not seen one person get this
correct.</p>
<p>No, and this leads me to my point.</p>
<p>The biggest misunderstood word or subject
is basically what the purpose of fat is.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the primary purpose of fat.</p>
<p>You guys ready for this?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re quite ready.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll have to do this next month, Judy,
what do you think?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just playing with you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a survival gland that protects against
the starvation of, what?</p>
<p>Does anyone know?</p>
<p>Sugar.</p>
<p>Let me say that again.</p>
<p>Fat&rsquo;s primary purpose is to protect against
the starvation of sugar.</p>
<p>It protects you against sugar starvation.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>That means that fat is a backup organ to sugar.</p>
<p>It backs up storage, it&rsquo;s a backup to sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, because you wouldn&rsquo;t last for
more than 72 hours, especially your brain,</p>
<p>your body gains fat in case it needs to do
that.</p>
<p>What does this tell us?</p>
<p>How does this relate to what we have to do
to get this fat off our bodies?</p>
<p>It means that you have to starve your body
of sugar.</p>
<p>Most of you already have done this, some of
you are trying to do this, a lot of people</p>
<p>have questions, so basically the most important
thing to know is that it&rsquo;s a backup organ</p>
<p>to sugar.</p>
<p>Knowing this data will now tell you what diet
would be best to be on, and if we look at</p>
<p>this compared to the conventional reduce your
calories and exercise more, well yeah, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to reduce your calories but according
to the government you&rsquo;re still going to consume</p>
<p>65 percent of your calories in carbohydrates.</p>
<p>You will never tap into your fat.</p>
<p>Weight Watchers.</p>
<p>A lot of Slim Fast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to burn fat.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re lowering calories, you might
lose water weight, but I guarantee you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to lose much fat.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>We must starve the body of sugar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bad news.</p>
<p>The good news is we can replace it with more
healthy fats, which is going to be very satisfying</p>
<p>to your body.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into exactly what that means in
a bit.</p>
<p>We must bring down the carbohydrates to about
five percent of our overall calories, which</p>
<p>comes out to about no more than 50 grams of
net carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Now, Judy, can you pop your mike back on?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Judy, tell me, do you know what a net carbohydrate
is?</p>
<p>Judy: Not really, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Eric Berg: It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>You basically look on the back of the label
and you get the total carbohydrates, then</p>
<p>you minus the fiber.</p>
<p>You minus that.</p>
<p>Thank you for answering me there, you can
put it back on mute.</p>
<p>We just take the total carbohydrates and we
minus the dietary fiber.</p>
<p>I want to just, I wish you could see this
slide but I&rsquo;ll send it to you.</p>
<p>I want to take broccoli, for example.</p>
<p>Broccoli has about 10 grams of carbohydrate,
but it has 3.8 grams of fiber.</p>
<p>So if you minus those two, you end up with
6.2 grams of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Not that much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have any problems with
eating broccoli, I&rsquo;ll tell you that right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an apple.</p>
<p>An apple has 25 grams of sugar and it has
4.4 grams of fiber.</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s 20.6 grams of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>So really, you could only get away with, if
you only ate that as your carbohydrate, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only going to get away with maybe two and
a half apples a day.</p>
<p>A lot of people, because they eat other things,
and there&rsquo;s a little bit of carbohydrate in</p>
<p>cheese and nuts and things like that, the
apples are going to blow them way out of ketosis.</p>
<p>I know I recommend apples in my book, so again,
I am very willing to change my ideas when</p>
<p>I test out new theories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending apples any more, especially
if you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight.</p>
<p>Maybe if you&rsquo;re maintaining weight, you can
definitely have them.</p>
<p>One thing I want to talk about apples, is
that it has just a tiny bit of fiber, so that</p>
<p>means that 19 grams of the total 25 grams
are completely sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of sugar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to celery.</p>
<p>Check how many carbohydrates are in celery.</p>
<p>1.2 grams, and there&rsquo;s .6 grams of fiber,
so we&rsquo;re left with .6 grams of total carbohydrates,</p>
<p>net carbohydrates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like half a gram of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>In other words, you can eat a lot of celery
and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about anything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually no dietary sugar in celery.</p>
<p>All right, good.</p>
<p>You guys are responsive.</p>
<p>You have a lot of good comments here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to those.</p>
<p>Hang in there.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s sour apples and there&rsquo;s
sweet apples but I think, I didn&rsquo;t check on</p>
<p>the amount of sugar in the sour apples, but
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not that low compared to where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going with this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>We must starve the body of sugar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a constant.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to keep our carbs very low.</p>
<p>The next topic we&rsquo;re going to talk about is
protein.</p>
<p>Protein is needed for the raw material for
ligaments, muscles, tendons, enzymes, hormones,</p>
<p>bones, cholesterol transportation, like good
and better cholesterol.</p>
<p>You have high density lipo proteins.</p>
<p>Basically, cholesterol has a protein shuttle
that moves it around.</p>
<p>The problem with protein is we need some,
but we don&rsquo;t want too much.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that too much can trigger
insulin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t shed off that much protein
each day.</p>
<p>Protein is used mainly for structural type
things, to replace the damaged parts.</p>
<p>I know people that when they try to beef up
and get bigger at the gym, they eat more protein,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen, they&rsquo;re going to strain
their livers and their kidneys, so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good advice.</p>
<p>We want to adjust the protein to the person.</p>
<p>To their size, and to their adrenal health.</p>
<p>The adrenal puts a person in, called a counterblock
state.</p>
<p>It breaks down protein a lot faster, especially
in the quadriceps muscles in your legs and</p>
<p>your gluteus maximus, which is your butt muscle.</p>
<p>Both of those muscles can break down if you
have adrenal stress, so you need a little</p>
<p>bit more protein, but overall we&rsquo;re not doing
a lot of protein.</p>
<p>I would say anywhere between three and six
ounces of protein per meal is perfect.</p>
<p>When you talk about the Atkins diet, they&rsquo;re
talking about doing a lot more protein.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about, ketosis is not a
lot of protein.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a moderate amount of protein.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to keep that as a constant.</p>
<p>We keep our carbs down and our proteins at
a constant.</p>
<p>So now, what&rsquo;s the last variable?</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Fat.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;ve been taught that if you eat fat,
you get fat, it&rsquo;s very bad, blah blah blah</p>
<p>blah blah.</p>
<p>Let me just give you some date on what fat
really will do when you consume the right</p>
<p>amount.</p>
<p>The first thing that it won&rsquo;t do is it will
not raise your insulin, because fat is neutral</p>
<p>with insulin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>The second thing is that when you start consuming
the right type of fats, you&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>that to satisfy the brain for the fat-soluble
vitamins that most vegetarians and other people</p>
<p>are deficient in.</p>
<p>When you eat your vegetables, even kale, people
will say, I eat spinach and I eat kale and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s loaded with vitamin A, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a precursor to vitamin A. It&rsquo;s not
the active form.</p>
<p>You need animal fats to get the active, available
form of the fats out of the vitamins, like</p>
<p>vitamin A. Where do you get vitamin A?</p>
<p>In butter.</p>
<p>Grass-fed butter.</p>
<p>Kerrygold butter is the best.</p>
<p>Carrots provide the precursor that convert
into the active form, but you really, if your</p>
<p>system is good, you only convert about five
percent of that so you&rsquo;d have to eat a lot</p>
<p>of vegetables to get your fats out of vitamins
and so people that are eating a lot of vegetables</p>
<p>and hardly any fat, they dry out.</p>
<p>The skin dries out.</p>
<p>We need those fats out of vitamins.</p>
<p>One thing to help you when you eat vegetables
to get more fats out of vitamins, out of that</p>
<p>vegetable, is to consume fat with your vegetables,
like butter.</p>
<p>Very smart thing to do.</p>
<p>The goal of ketosis goes beyond just weight
loss, but here&rsquo;s what we want to do when you</p>
<p>get on the ketosis.</p>
<p>We want you to not just burn the fat that
you&rsquo;re eating, which you will, but we want</p>
<p>you to tap into your reserves.</p>
<p>That is the only way you&rsquo;re going to do it,
is if you cut the carbs down.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>You will have to adjust the amount of fats
to your activity level.</p>
<p>There is something of, certain people burn
more calories than others and some people</p>
<p>are going to need a little bit more fat.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sedentary and you have a very poor
metabolism, you might not be able to have</p>
<p>the amount of fats of someone 18.</p>
<p>But you can definitely have some to satisfy
your body and run the machine a lot better.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another variable that we have to
adjust as we go through this.</p>
<p>Why do we need fat to burn fat?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>First of all, the body considers fat as the
last-stored ditch effort of survival, and</p>
<p>so if you cut the fat away your body will
start holding on to fat more dearly.</p>
<p>When you start putting that fat back, it will
feel a lot safer to be able to let some of</p>
<p>it go, because again it&rsquo;s a survival mechanism.</p>
<p>If you have no dietary fats, you starve the
body of not only the ketones but the structural</p>
<p>types of fats that you need to surround all
the cells of your body, to surround all the</p>
<p>nerve endings, because all your nerves are
surrounded with myelin sheath, that&rsquo;s fat,</p>
<p>and your brain is mostly fat, so you actually
starve some of the structural fats and you</p>
<p>end up having a lot of health problems with
the immune system.</p>
<p>I think it was Pritikin, he had a lot of health
problems, I think he committed suicide, I</p>
<p>think it probably affected his whole mood
when you cut your fats was down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very dangerous to have a very low-fat
diet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much healthier to have the healthy fats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing the fats forever, and I consume
a tremendous amount of fats.</p>
<p>If you do a low-carb, low-fat and high-protein
diet, you will then spike that insulin because</p>
<p>high protein stimulates insulin.</p>
<p>It stresses the kidneys and liver.</p>
<p>So the person will start feeling more bloated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get back pain a little bit higher
up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the stress on the kidney.</p>
<p>If you do a low-carb, low-fat, low protein,
there&rsquo;s not enough fats to stimulate the ketosis</p>
<p>and so your body because of the low protein,
low fat, will have a tendency to go after</p>
<p>structural proteins of your body, so it starts
to break down more protein.</p>
<p>Really, the ideal, when you look at it from
all different sides, the ideal situation is</p>
<p>to have about five percent of the total calories
being carbohydrate, 20 to 25 percent being</p>
<p>protein, and the rest being fat.</p>
<p>Then you just have adjust the quantities.</p>
<p>Really eating fat keeps the body out of stress.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have those danger signals.</p>
<p>In fact, think about what sugar metabolism
is.</p>
<p>Eating sugar puts your body in the state of
fight or flight mode, all the time, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sudden burst of quick energy that keeps
dropping blood sugars up and down, up and</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to activate cortisol, that&rsquo;s that
stress hormone.</p>
<p>Where do you get your vitamin A, vitamin D,
vitamin E, K2?</p>
<p>You get vitamin A from the grass-fed butter.</p>
<p>You also will get it from the cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Vitamin D from the sun, cod liver oil again,
fish oils, grass-fed butter and egg yolks</p>
<p>are loaded with vitamin D. Vitamin E you can
get from butter again, but you can also get</p>
<p>it from nuts and seeds and certain oils.</p>
<p>The other one I want to talk about is vitamin
K2.</p>
<p>Vitamin K2 is one of the most important vitamins
for a lot of health problems, specifically</p>
<p>making your arteries elastic, so it&rsquo;s really
good for blood pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to clean out the calcium buildup
in your arteries and your joints.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in grass-fed beef, butter and cheese.</p>
<p>So you want that grass-fed cow.</p>
<p>Very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a recently discovered vitamin,
but it makes sense now that putting your body</p>
<p>in ketosis would naturally have you gravitate
to more of these fatty foods that have the</p>
<p>vitamins that you&rsquo;ve been missing this whole
time.</p>
<p>I always ask people that are vegetarians,
I says, &ldquo;Where do you get your vitamin K2?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You could get it from a vegetarian source,
it&rsquo;s called natto.</p>
<p>But where do you get all your vitamin A?</p>
<p>And where do you get your other fats out of
the vitamins?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something to consider.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to get into ketosis if
you&rsquo;re vegetarian.</p>
<p>I have nothing against trying to do that,
but most vegetarians are grainaterians.</p>
<p>They do the grains and the breads and the
pastas.</p>
<p>Now, what types of fats are healthy?</p>
<p>That is the question.</p>
<p>The types of fats that are low stress to the
liver and don&rsquo;t stress the gall bladder are</p>
<p>the medium chain fats, medium chain triglycerides.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>That means that those fats that you would
consume, like grass-fed butter, that&rsquo;s a medium</p>
<p>chain triglyceride.</p>
<p>Coconut butter is a, called MCT, medium chain
triglyceride.</p>
<p>Olive oil is good, grass-fed cheese, pasture
raised eggs, where chickens go out there and</p>
<p>can go and eat grass.</p>
<p>Grass-fed beef, pasture raised chickens, those
are the ones that you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>eat.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, grass-fed beef has a really
good type of fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a mono-unsaturated fat, that bypasses
your liver and it&rsquo;s used just for energy.</p>
<p>I feel really good when I do that, but you
don&rsquo;t want to consume the lean beef.</p>
<p>You want to have the fattier beef.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to have the chicken with the
skin off.</p>
<p>You want that skin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly opposite of what we&rsquo;ve been taught.</p>
<p>Ketones provide three times as much energy,
so you&rsquo;ll find that your brain just has more</p>
<p>energy.</p>
<p>You actually need a little bit less sleep
if you do this and it&rsquo;s very stable on your</p>
<p>blood sugar so you don&rsquo;t get so moody.</p>
<p>So many people have anxiety.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just their blood sugar.</p>
<p>Especially if they&rsquo;re waking up in the middle
of the night having anxiety.</p>
<p>Ketones are only made, and I&rsquo;m not talking
about diabetes, but ketones, called nutritional</p>
<p>ketosis, only occurs when the body is starving
of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you have to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other benefits too that I want
to talk about with your gut.</p>
<p>A lot of people get swelling in their gut
when they have just a little bit of fruit</p>
<p>and beans and some other grains, it just tears
them up.</p>
<p>When they start going more fat, their entire
digestive system does wonderful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget, I was living on grains,
trying to be a vegetarian when I was 28, and</p>
<p>then one day I was in California, I was driving
down the street, and I see this huge building.</p>
<p>It says, The Health House.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this yellow building.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Honey, let&rsquo;s go in there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what they have.</p>
<p>Maybe they can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This old-time weight lifter guy was selling
vitamins and things, and he brought me in</p>
<p>the back and he gave me some raw milk and
he said here, eat this beef, whatever, and</p>
<p>that was in the morning and I ate that and
I felt so amazingly good.</p>
<p>So I started having that for breakfast, and
I do much much better and I cut the cereal</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>I used to be the epitome of the junk-food
junkie.</p>
<p>I used to eat the muffins, huge muffins, Life
cereal, I would do that.</p>
<p>I would live on sugar.</p>
<p>But coming back to my point was that your
gut could do very well on fats.</p>
<p>In fact, the microbes in your gut primarily
live on something called butyric acid, and</p>
<p>yes, that does come from the breakdown of
eating vegetables, but it also comes from</p>
<p>butter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main source to feed your microbes.</p>
<p>The other source, smaller source of something
that feeds your microbes would be acetic acid,</p>
<p>and that is in apple cider vinegar.</p>
<p>Apple cider vinegar is a really good thing.</p>
<p>A teaspoon in some water and as you drink
that with your lemon, forget the cranberry,</p>
<p>but just drink that through the day, that
will really help you in shrinking your stomach.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about beef, for example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a hamburger without the bun.</p>
<p>How much carbohydrate is in the hamburger?</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>How much fat is in there?</p>
<p>24 percent of that hamburger is fat.</p>
<p>Guess how much protein?</p>
<p>30 percent.</p>
<p>So we got, it&rsquo;s almost half fat and half protein.</p>
<p>When I say you need 60 percent of your diet
fat, I&rsquo;m talking about a lot of the protein</p>
<p>sources that you&rsquo;re eating have a tremendous
amount of fat already.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about thinking that piece
of meat, for example, is pure protein and</p>
<p>you have to eat all this lard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about that.</p>
<p>A lot of the proteins that you already eat
are loaded with a certain percentage of fat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study that I&rsquo;m going to send you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the long term effects of a ketogenic
diet in obese patients.</p>
<p>This is what it says.</p>
<p>This is experimental clinical cardiology.</p>
<p>Says, &ldquo;The administration of a ketogenic diet
for relatively longer periods of time did</p>
<p>not produce any significant side effects in
patients.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to use for longer periods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re not going to admit this
because who wants to be wrong, right?</p>
<p>All right, so, I also, I wish I could show
you this picture.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can do that now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if that screen share &hellip; No.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I have these new keto bombs I want to share
with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing recipe.</p>
<p>In fact, I will send, let me see if I can
send that right now.</p>
<p>Some of you have already clicked on and went
to drberg.com fat burning diets.</p>
<p>Let me just see if I can send that to you
here.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe I can.</p>
<p>I think that went to everyone.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can, oh, to everyone.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>To everyone.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll paste it in there, boom.</p>
<p>Now everyone should get this link, and you
could look at this later, not right now, but</p>
<p>if you go in there, a lot of you already went
in there but I added some new things.</p>
<p>I added these new keto bombs that are just
amazingly delicious.</p>
<p>I give you the recipe and you can make them
as a base and you can put all sorts of things</p>
<p>in there to make them interesting with nuts
and they&rsquo;re delicious and they&rsquo;re very healthy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the best treats that you can eat,
and I&rsquo;m going through quite a few of those</p>
<p>little guys.</p>
<p>I also have in here kind of a general eating
plan that I&rsquo;m going to recommend for you,</p>
<p>but the other thing I want to mention is that
&hellip; Yes.</p>
<p>I want to answer a question.</p>
<p>Yes, it will be later available on YouTube.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that I wanted to mention.</p>
<p>That the kale recipe, the kale shake recipe
that I&rsquo;ve been recommending, I&rsquo;m changing</p>
<p>that recipe and I&rsquo;m actually going to put
it in a booklet and just get it out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be on my website, but here&rsquo;s the thing
that I wanted to mention about that, is that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking out the fruit and I&rsquo;m putting in
there something called liquid stevia.</p>
<p>Very flavored, with two tablespoons of coconut
oil.</p>
<p>You blend it up, I swear, it tastes just like
a kale shake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, and you don&rsquo;t really need the
berries.</p>
<p>That would be something you can do on a regular
basis.</p>
<p>I have a whole week of foods that I&rsquo;m going
to get to your guys, and then I have the new</p>
<p>kale shake recipe and how to make it, and
there&rsquo;s a couple other things that you need</p>
<p>to think about when you to this ketosis eating
plan.</p>
<p>One is that some people are going to have
to adapt to ketosis, and that adaptation takes</p>
<p>anywhere between three days to two weeks but
think about, it could probably take you more</p>
<p>than two weeks to get into a good state.</p>
<p>Your body has to adapt to it, it has to make
new enzymes, it has to produce more bile,</p>
<p>and if you have any liver or gall bladder
issues you may need to add bile in there.</p>
<p>A lot of you are taking my gall bladder formula,
but I want to let you know I changed the formula</p>
<p>just recently.</p>
<p>The new formula, I added something called
pancreatin to the gall bladder formula.</p>
<p>Not only does it have the bile for the gall
bladder support and the stomach enzymes, but</p>
<p>now we have the ultimate pancreatic enzymes,
especially lipase.</p>
<p>Lipase is the main enzymes to digest lipids
or fats, so the reason I put that in there</p>
<p>is because I realized that when people take
the bile and it breaks down the fat, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break it all the way down to the smallest
level.</p>
<p>They need the lipase to take it all the way
down to complete, full digestion so the new</p>
<p>gall bladder formula has all three main component
parts so it handles all parts of the digestion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of something that a lot of people
take when they are doing more fats.</p>
<p>The other thing you want to think about when
you do this is that you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>increase your sea salt when you do this, because
carbohydrates store so much sugar and when</p>
<p>you actually eating them, you dump all the
sugar and you dump some of the electrolytes,</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t add the sea salt back into
the diet you might be a little dizzy, headachy,</p>
<p>lethargy, fatigue, all those symptoms.</p>
<p>I also recommend doing a calcium/magnesium
before bed.</p>
<p>You can get calcium citrate, magnesium citrate
and just take it before bed, because calcium/magnesium</p>
<p>is going to be a little bit more important
now if you&rsquo;re doing more fat and low carbs.</p>
<p>Unless you have too much calcium, which is
probably not the case.</p>
<p>We want to look at several things.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that the minerals are
in there, that we can digest some of these</p>
<p>fats, we want to keep the constant low carbohydrate,
moderate protein, and higher fats.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to adjust the fats for your
tolerance, for your digestion and for your</p>
<p>weight loss.</p>
<p>If you are not active, obviously you&rsquo;re not
going to have as many fats as I do.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re exercising, you can get away
with more fats.</p>
<p>Now that your body is getting more in ketosis,
you&rsquo;re not going to crave anything anymore,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be as hungry, so you&rsquo;re
not going to have the appetite you had before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be much better to do this and
let&rsquo;s say, before you go to bed just take</p>
<p>one of those keto snacks and you&rsquo;re good to
go.</p>
<p>What I want to do, I want to answer some questions.</p>
<p>Someone asked about milk.</p>
<p>Milk is high in protein, but it has lactose.</p>
<p>You might want to look on the label and see
how many net carbohydrates, because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a lot of fiber in that milk,
so you want to end up with no more than 50</p>
<p>net carbohydrates per day, so you might want
to do a little calculation on that.</p>
<p>What are the optimum numbers for ketosis?</p>
<p>As far as what numbers?</p>
<p>When you test your urine for ketosis?</p>
<p>You can get a keto strip and urinate and see
if you&rsquo;re in strong ketosis or not, but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be discouraged if you don&rsquo;t get into ketosis
right away.</p>
<p>It might take two weeks, or four weeks.</p>
<p>Some people get constipation.</p>
<p>They might need a little bit of bile support,
and that&rsquo;s in the gall bladder formula.</p>
<p>That lubricates the colon and add a little
more sea salt to add more fluid and water</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t dry out.</p>
<p>That should handle those symptoms.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a gall bladder, you definitely
need some support in that area, because where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the bile coming from?</p>
<p>Strictly down your liver.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to take bile as extract
with each meal because you don&rsquo;t have enough,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t be able to pull in the fats
out of vitamins that you need, you&rsquo;ll end</p>
<p>up with dry skin.</p>
<p>Someone asked about alcohol.</p>
<p>Alcohol is out.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do alcohol, I&rsquo;m sorry, because it&rsquo;s
going to bump you out of ketosis for probably</p>
<p>a good week.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to do that, you can do it.</p>
<p>Someone asked about kefir.</p>
<p>There is a type of kefir that you can use
that is non-lactate, so that&rsquo;s no sugar.</p>
<p>Lactate is milk sugar, so I think you can
get away with that.</p>
<p>One of the great ingredients in this keto
bomb is cream cheese, organic cream cheese.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, it makes the cookies so amazing.</p>
<p>Eggs, that depends on your size.</p>
<p>I do four eggs and cheese in the morning every
single morning.</p>
<p>My wife can&rsquo;t do more than two eggs, she can&rsquo;t
do it.</p>
<p>So it really depends on how many that you,
how big you are and your appetite.</p>
<p>Turkey bacon?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend it because it&rsquo;s too lean.</p>
<p>You actually need a good source of bacon that
has no nitrates and hormone free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to recommend.</p>
<p>Unless you want the turkey bacon just for
your protein.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of questions coming in here.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re pregnant and nursing, that&rsquo;s something
I&rsquo;m not going to recommend on line here because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take responsibility.</p>
<p>I think what I would do is I would check with
your doctor and see if it&rsquo;s okay, but just</p>
<p>make sure that &hellip; If you take an infant,
breast milk is the ultimate ketose diet because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting all these fats.</p>
<p>An infant used ketones in a developing brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they use.</p>
<p>Diet soda?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s better than sugar but it&rsquo;s not
the greatest.</p>
<p>What I do is I take Pellegrino, this stuff
right here, Pellegrino, I go through tons</p>
<p>of them.</p>
<p>I put about five drops of flavored root beer
or cola stevia, and it tastes like a soda.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Pam asked, can I skip a meal if I&rsquo;m not hungry?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>See, this is the thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to find that your appetite&rsquo;s
going to go down, you&rsquo;re not going to be as</p>
<p>hungry, then don&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to actually help you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll do fine, because you&rsquo;re actually
eating denser calorie foods and you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have enough nutrients and you can tap into
more fat if you do that.</p>
<p>Someone asked about avocados.</p>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
<p>Wonderful fat, I love it.</p>
<p>Someone asked about xylitol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my sugar, that I have.</p>
<p>Xylitol is a great birchbark type of sweetener,
it&rsquo;s way better than the other ones.</p>
<p>Some of the vegetarian chocolate chips use
maltitol.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy them with maltitol.</p>
<p>You can do with mannitol if you want.</p>
<p>I like the stevia.</p>
<p>But maltitol, I don&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend honey, either.</p>
<p>Coffee, if you have a small amount of coffee
with xylitol, not any more of that, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be a big problem.</p>
<p>Kidney disease.</p>
<p>If you have kidney disease, that&rsquo;s another,
I&rsquo;m not going to answer that online because</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s going to say, &ldquo;Oh, yeah, Dr. Berg
&hellip;&rdquo; That&rsquo;s something like a one on one question,</p>
<p>but I will say that people with kidney disease
do not do well with a lot of protein, but</p>
<p>they do really well on some fats.</p>
<p>They do very well.</p>
<p>In fact, I would love to do a research project,
go down to the local dialysis unit and just</p>
<p>put everyone on the right eating plan.</p>
<p>I bet you I would see incredible things.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not going to let me do that.</p>
<p>What about the adrenal?</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s asking about the adrenal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good program for the adrenal,
but you just have to have a little bit more</p>
<p>protein.</p>
<p>More protein.</p>
<p>The problem with some people, if they&rsquo;re real,
have severe blood sugar issues, have severe</p>
<p>hypoglycemic, they might have the transition
phase that&rsquo;s a little more gradual, so you</p>
<p>may have to add maybe some fruit into that
mix for a little bit.</p>
<p>Out of all, oh, you might want to mute your
mike, Judy.</p>
<p>Out of all the sweet things, there&rsquo;s level
of damaging sweet fruits.</p>
<p>If we have potatoes and things like that versus
fruit, fruit is much better even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweet, and the reason for that, the fructose
has a different pathway than starches.</p>
<p>Fructose does not necessarily spike insulin.</p>
<p>It does create fat in the liver, but it doesn&rsquo;t
jack up insulin as much as some of these starches.</p>
<p>So if someone was a diabetic and they had
low blood sugar, don&rsquo;t take the glucose tablets,</p>
<p>take some fruit.</p>
<p>Not orange juice, but actual fruit.</p>
<p>Does the diet affect hypo-thyroidism and adrenal
fatigue?</p>
<p>It probably would improve both conditions,
but hypo-thyroid is usually coming secondary</p>
<p>from estrogen dominance or a gall bladder/liver
problem.</p>
<p>You can watch that video that I created on
that.</p>
<p>Nutritional yeast is totally fine, because
that&rsquo;ll give you the B vitamins that you need.</p>
<p>Type I diabetics need to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take the stress off the pancreas and
really help them stabilize the blood sugars.</p>
<p>The only thing you have to do is you have
to make sure your greens are very high.</p>
<p>So in this eating plan, where I get all my
vitamins and minerals is from the greens.</p>
<p>My salads are huge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going a lot of green vegetable, but I
eat the fiber.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just juice everything.</p>
<p>I want the nutrients, I want some of the fiber
in there.</p>
<p>These are coming through.</p>
<p>It says Dr. Gregg doesn&rsquo;t agree with extracting
fiber from the carbs.</p>
<p>He says carbs are carbs.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to just look at the net carb.</p>
<p>You want to see if there&rsquo;s actual sugars in
there and you want to use judgment.</p>
<p>Obviously if it&rsquo;s a vegetable, you don&rsquo;t really
have to worry about it so much.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s some box food, you do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things that you know that
are high glycemic, you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>avoid them.</p>
<p>Make sure that your xylitol, that&rsquo;s a good
point, Lynn, is from birchbark, not from corn.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wheat grass juice powder is totally fine to
consume because it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>sugar in that and it&rsquo;s a tremendous amount
of concentrated green juice that will give</p>
<p>you a lot of nutrition.</p>
<p>Almond butter is good, unsweetened peanut
butter is good unless you have allergies.</p>
<p>Someone says, will I ever be able to eat fruit
again?</p>
<p>Yeah, you will.</p>
<p>Once you lose the weight, then you can stick
in the fruits more as a maintenance because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be able to get away with more
carbohydrate the more you do this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically fixing your pancreas, you&rsquo;re
fixing your liver when you do this, because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking all the stress off the pancreas
that&rsquo;s been working so hard, so it starts</p>
<p>to come back and recover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful thing to do for your body.</p>
<p>Kombucha tea?</p>
<p>You want to get the one with two grams of
sugar and make sure that you don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>more than that.</p>
<p>Some of them have a lot more sugar.</p>
<p>You just have to look at labels.</p>
<p>Cruciferous vegetables, if you can&rsquo;t do those,
that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Do spinach.</p>
<p>Do leafy greens.</p>
<p>Totally fine.</p>
<p>Let me just grab this right here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s four more minutes.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned ketosis for polycystic ovarian
syndrome, absolutely.</p>
<p>It would be the thing that I think would help
you more than anything.</p>
<p>Boy, you guys ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p>These flowing through so fast.</p>
<p>How do you gain muscle on ketosis?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re going to get leaner, you&rsquo;re going
to burn fat, you don&rsquo;t need a lot of protein</p>
<p>to build muscle.</p>
<p>You need exercise, but you need to keep the
insulin low so you don&rsquo;t get that conversion</p>
<p>to the fatty tissue.</p>
<p>I have lots of people who lost tremendous
amount of weight doing this, and they were</p>
<p>very stubborn before, this is what they really
needed.</p>
<p>You have to take it one step further.</p>
<p>I want to send everyone a link to something
that I want to ask you.</p>
<p>A lot of you are on my email list, a lot of
you watch my videos and you know that I give</p>
<p>a lot of free stuff out.</p>
<p>I hope you appreciate that.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m going to ask from you in exchange
tonight is to give me an unbiased review.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I want in exchange, I want a review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to send you a link to this review
site, you just type in a review, tell me what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your experience with my information, what
you think about me, whatever.</p>
<p>Be honest and say whatever you want to say,
but then you&rsquo;ll get an email, probably tomorrow</p>
<p>morning, that will tell you to cut and paste
that review onto either Google Plus or another</p>
<p>site, and I&rsquo;d really appreciate that is you
would do that for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to continue to give you guys a lot
of good content but in exchange I would really</p>
<p>appreciate it if you could give me a review.</p>
<p>I sent you the link, and you can do that after
we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>I want to thank you in advance for that.</p>
<p>Someone just asked me a question, I got to
go back, I just quickly saw that, oh, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Neuropathy.</p>
<p>Peripheral neuropathy is purely high sugar
in the blood, so when you do this eating plan,</p>
<p>your sugars will be so much better it&rsquo;ll take
the pressure off the destruction of the myelin</p>
<p>sheath and it will greatly improve the peripheral
neuropathy.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re going to have to add nutritional
yeast to add those B vitamins to be able to</p>
<p>feed the deficiencies that you&rsquo;re creating
by all this insulin.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Someone said, but I can&rsquo;t buy and afford everything
in the world.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to spend a lot of money on
a ketosis diet.</p>
<p>You could make these keto bombs in bulk.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not eating as much food.</p>
<p>You can make the most incredible ice cream,
I&rsquo;m going to create some videos on how to</p>
<p>make some ice cream that is totally legal,
and you can do that, and it&rsquo;s not expensive.</p>
<p>You make a whole bunch and you freeze it.</p>
<p>There is a way to do it.</p>
<p>How many carbs can I have per day?</p>
<p>I would say no more than 50 carbs a day, but
don&rsquo;t worry about salads.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get a lot of carbs from
them.</p>
<p>But even &hellip; I&rsquo;m 50, and my skin keeps getting
better and better the more I do this.</p>
<p>I do take a lot of fat-soluble vitamins, I
use the gall bladder formula to emulsify,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m constantly pushing fats into my system
and I don&rsquo;t have dry skin or anything like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Okay, if you didn&rsquo;t get the email that I sent
to everyone, I&rsquo;ll send it one more time, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just send it to your email right now,
actually.</p>
<p>It should be going right now, so if you don&rsquo;t
get an email, I sent it to you, and if you</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t get an email, do me a favor.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, go to my Google Plus page and do
a review on Google Plus.</p>
<p>I would appreciate that very much.</p>
<p>I want to keep it to an hour, I do these monthly,
I&rsquo;m going to be asking for more ideas to talk</p>
<p>about, but I hope you got some tips.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing more seminars.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the attention and all
the questions, and yes, I will send you that</p>
<p>recipe, George, for ice cream and the keto
bombs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be checking out now, so I want
to thank you guys for coming out and thank</p>
<p>you, Judy, for being there, to be someone
I could relay stuff back and forth.</p>
<p>This video will be recorded on my YouTube
channel, which is, you could find that by</p>
<p>typing in Dr. Berg, and I know you guys are
just downloaded all these questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be able to get to all of
them but I want to thank you guys and have</p>
<p>a great evening.</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>
