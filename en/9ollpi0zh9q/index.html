we didn&rsquo;t see</p><p>most location I just just on the road</p><p>for a few days</p><p>yeah I like it oh there we go that&rsquo;s</p><p>yeah good we got five people on this is</p><p>exciting</p><p>okay and I&rsquo;m trying to get on anything</p><p>that we say is not meant to diagnose you</p><p>I&rsquo;m here to answer your questions</p><p>and yeah it&rsquo;s just for information for</p><p>you to research with your doc got Connie</p><p>Connie is on hi Connie</p><p>alright guys we&rsquo;re up to 12 people</p><p>that&rsquo;s exciting who put me out if you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna only put my nose on you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>have it to hear all right we&rsquo;ll just</p><p>wait a second here and see if we can</p><p>hold up a couple things let&rsquo;s say go</p><p>press here that&rsquo;s here press videos</p><p>alright it should be coming up I can try</p><p>this right here okay alright so um good</p><p>morning there&rsquo;s people actually in</p><p>different time zones would we have</p><p>someone from Morocco</p><p>Jason peek is first Wow</p><p>that&rsquo;s exciting alright we have someone</p><p>from Kentucky okay so Mary says I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been trying to call you but it&rsquo;s not</p><p>going through</p><p>yeah today we&rsquo;re not gonna be able to</p><p>take calls because we&rsquo;re just using my</p><p>cell phone next week we&rsquo;ll be in the new</p><p>studio so we can take your call so we</p><p>got people from Maryland Wisconsin</p><p>what part okay can you talk about having</p><p>too many electrolytes yes go alright so</p><p>if you have too many electrolytes</p><p>potentially you could start having</p><p>loosed bowels you can have diarrhea but</p><p>generally speaking if you have too much</p><p>potassium for example your body will</p><p>release it i&rsquo;ve hip too much magnesium</p><p>you know it creates pretty much just a</p><p>lock sit laxative effect that&rsquo;s pretty</p><p>much the only side effect you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>have if you&rsquo;re doing massive amounts</p><p>over a long period of time that can</p><p>create other issues but typically it&rsquo;s</p><p>not going to be an issue now taking too</p><p>much calcium is a big problem but</p><p>typically if you&rsquo;re taking in the</p><p>electrolyte powder that I&rsquo;m right that I</p><p>recommend you&rsquo;re not gonna have an issue</p><p>all right so we have turn up the sound</p><p>okay how is that we have Rivera from</p><p>India okay is xanthan gum bad well it&rsquo;s</p><p>a fiber it&rsquo;s not too bad a lot of the</p><p>research done with fiber is using that</p><p>gum it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s considered low glycemic</p><p>because it&rsquo;s a fiber so it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>used in a lot of different things</p><p>to make the texture just right it&rsquo;s um</p><p>it&rsquo;s not toxic it&rsquo;s not going to be an</p><p>issue some people you know it might Kant</p><p>constipate them if you have too much so</p><p>some people actually get digestive</p><p>issues if they have too much but it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s rare we have some people from</p><p>Germany Libya how&rsquo;s it coming uh</p><p>pregnant I can&rsquo;t all right okay so is</p><p>the allergy is oh is it is there an</p><p>allergy outside of vinegar no what&rsquo;s</p><p>probably happening is you might detox</p><p>and oh there it is right there live Wow</p><p>how about videos did that answer the</p><p>question about allergies okay you can&rsquo;t</p><p>actually have a true ology I think what</p><p>happens is that it&rsquo;s throwing off your</p><p>your pH you could actually have some</p><p>arrays and histamines from that so</p><p>histamines can increase if that&rsquo;s the</p><p>case there could be a problem in what&rsquo;s</p><p>called fermentation and your because</p><p>what happens what the way they they make</p><p>episode of the vinegar as they ferment</p><p>apple juice and it goes through a</p><p>certain process so there could be some I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know residue from some</p><p>fermentation that you could be sensitive</p><p>to in which case you probably would be</p><p>okay with just regular vinegar but I</p><p>don&rsquo;t recommend taking it so I would</p><p>just not take it if you have some</p><p>sensitivity to it alright let&rsquo;s see can</p><p>you do keto while you&rsquo;re pregnant</p><p>absolutely yes you just might want to</p><p>just kind of be cautious</p><p>about a minute fasting ok surgery when I</p><p>was 9 now it hurts and stiff when okay</p><p>so your lung surgery now you&rsquo;re 9 and it</p><p>hurts and you have stiffness there&rsquo;s a</p><p>really good product that you can take</p><p>for improving lung function and that</p><p>would be something called new betrothing</p><p>PMG it&rsquo;s a standard process product you</p><p>can probably finally find it on Amazon</p><p>okay choline and NASA tall I take both</p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed serious belly bloating and</p><p>lately not good as I&rsquo;m a personal</p><p>trainer I totally understand could it be</p><p>the choline inositol chances are it&rsquo;s</p><p>the inositol I would just get them</p><p>individually and I think it&rsquo;ll be okay</p><p>with the choline but it also could be</p><p>the quality of the product as well I</p><p>have a question that won&rsquo;t even be seen</p><p>are there too many people right now yes</p><p>there are too many people to answer all</p><p>these questions now there&rsquo;s actually 971</p><p>people</p><p>okay thoughts on ramadan i have no</p><p>opinion because i don&rsquo;t know much about</p><p>it i was great for intermittent fasting</p><p>yeah because you have to fast if you&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to get into intermittent fasting</p><p>and you celebrate Ramadan that&rsquo;s the</p><p>perfect time just make sure that when</p><p>you come off your fasting you&rsquo;re not</p><p>eating garbage right it&rsquo;s what you eat</p><p>when you stop fasting okay how many</p><p>carbs in dr. Burgess electrolyte powder</p><p>there&rsquo;s actually zero carbohydrates</p><p>there is no carbohydrates that&rsquo;s why we</p><p>didn&rsquo;t have to list it all right adrenal</p><p>fatigue you know one of the best things</p><p>for adrenal fatigue is vitamin D but</p><p>vitamin D I think I&rsquo;m gonna bring this</p><p>up now Karen if you can grab my notes</p><p>right over there I just forgot them yeah</p><p>thank you so I have some things we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna share throughout this period of</p><p>time I want to just talk first of all</p><p>vitamin D vitamin D normal rdas are</p><p>basically like 600 I use which is</p><p>incredibly small amounts and the way</p><p>they came up with those figures is</p><p>arbitrarily using some a few studies</p><p>that show that it will prevent rickets</p><p>but it&rsquo;s not really designed to maintain</p><p>like levels to maintain health or</p><p>therapeutic levels to improve autoimmune</p><p>conditions or even issues with</p><p>depression or clinical problems they</p><p>they don&rsquo;t really take those in</p><p>consideration so it&rsquo;s really almost</p><p>impossible to create an effect with</p><p>vitamin D and a lot of body parts</p><p>unless you&rsquo;re doing close to twenty to</p><p>thirty thousand I use per day now some</p><p>people are saying wow that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot did you realize that thirty thousand</p><p>I use or let me say let me take the back</p><p>now thirty thousand I use is one</p><p>milligram of vitamin d3</p><p>so again there&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m gonna do a lot</p><p>more videos on this but it&rsquo;s a very very</p><p>hot topic right now very interesting the</p><p>vitamin D is like if you have any type</p><p>of like mood disorders or insomnia or</p><p>chronic pain you should be going up with</p><p>your vitamin D 220-thousand I used even</p><p>30,000 I use and sometimes even more and</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna see start seeing some</p><p>changed with that because you have about</p><p>35 billion mm white blood cells in your</p><p>bond those are the soldiers that</p><p>actually do the protecting and every</p><p>single one of those cells need vitamin D</p><p>to work correctly so you could imagine</p><p>if you&rsquo;re low in vitamin D your immune</p><p>system is very very weak so it&rsquo;s really</p><p>a simple thing to increase vitamin D</p><p>inexpensive and it&rsquo;s very difficult to</p><p>get from food so hope there&rsquo;s a long</p><p>long winded answer to your question</p><p>let&rsquo;s say I have so many pimples on my</p><p>face</p><p>is it my genes no no you just need to</p><p>lower your insulin and that will</p><p>actually help your antigens I have a</p><p>whole video on acne you should watch</p><p>that ok nausea please help with the keto</p><p>with died oh please with okay please</p><p>with a keto digest I&rsquo;m not sure what you</p><p>mean by that but if you have nausea when</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing keto it could be that</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing too much fat</p><p>from adaptation which you need B</p><p>vitamins so you might want to play</p><p>around with B vitamins and reducing your</p><p>fat another thing that helps nausea is</p><p>outside of vinegar or pertain how to</p><p>chloride which can improve your bile</p><p>release and help that symptoms okay so C</p><p>can anorexics reverse diet</p><p>I guess you&rsquo;re asking can that diet</p><p>reverse the condition of anorexia I</p><p>don&rsquo;t really understand the question so</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna move on because it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>make sense to me okay so you have to</p><p>clarify that because it&rsquo;s just like can</p><p>anorexic reversed diet I don&rsquo;t know what</p><p>that means let&rsquo;s say seven weeks in and</p><p>feeling fantastic awesome Karen what do</p><p>we have over there half my face here you</p><p>go yes Karen people I don&rsquo;t have to view</p><p>a video I just don&rsquo;t want to have my</p><p>face in the video you just don&rsquo;t want</p><p>half of you I just yeah okay hello</p><p>people okay so can you give K two kids</p><p>sure they need it okay but the pill yes</p><p>it&rsquo;s you can give it to kids um</p><p>you want to actually have kids eat those</p><p>foods as well you know I spit butter</p><p>press the cheese and egg yolks that</p><p>pasture-raised eggs good now someone</p><p>here I forget his name says he&rsquo;s got low</p><p>cholesterol he&rsquo;s always had super low</p><p>like too low how can you increase your</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s a problem</p><p>actually there&rsquo;s more problems with low</p><p>cholesterol than there is high</p><p>cholesterol so I would honestly start</p><p>chowing down the eggs make sure the egg</p><p>yolks starting food with a cholesterol</p><p>there are certain are you born I&rsquo;m</p><p>already Wow I gotta I gotta make this</p><p>more interesting</p><p>but yeah you need increased more</p><p>cholesterol but if you&rsquo;re actually</p><p>consuming more cholesterol and your</p><p>cholesterol still low it&rsquo;s just because</p><p>your body&rsquo;s not make</p><p>as much one way to really increase</p><p>cholesterol recommend is eat a lot of</p><p>carbs refined carbs I don&rsquo;t recommend</p><p>that so I would actually not worry about</p><p>it if your cholesterol is like if you&rsquo;re</p><p>eight if you&rsquo;re eating a good amount of</p><p>cholesterol and it&rsquo;s still though I</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>okay getting too much fat in the keto</p><p>diet am I worried about gaining weight</p><p>no what&rsquo;s going on with your carb so you</p><p>got to keep your carbs low how many you</p><p>eat but he was eating like massive</p><p>amounts I would know it wasn&rsquo;t dietary</p><p>fat that was like chowing down six or</p><p>seven keto bombs at night yeah I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know I don&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t tell if you gained</p><p>weight he just wasn&rsquo;t losing weight but</p><p>the point is that I think you did you</p><p>need to intermittent fasting that is</p><p>like the most important thing and then</p><p>adjust your fats okay now what about</p><p>love handles that&rsquo;s not a body type is</p><p>it no it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not really a specific</p><p>body type it&rsquo;s just excess fat that&rsquo;s</p><p>spilling off from your liver and</p><p>spilling off from the your your viscera</p><p>around your organs Food for Thought</p><p>I had exam sorry I get a headache</p><p>I fast I would ease into it slowly and</p><p>if you start getting a headache eat a</p><p>meal and then gradually do this over a</p><p>period of time okay so there&rsquo;s a video</p><p>feed issue</p><p>I know because we&rsquo;re in a remote</p><p>location yeah this is like this is</p><p>called cope coat this is not the fancy</p><p>professional film studio with producers</p><p>this is just called telephone</p><p>yes flat you see here lying by the seat</p><p>of thine own pants okay someone had a</p><p>question Karen PCOS you already know if</p><p>that is Dean&rsquo;s syndrome mm-hmm</p><p>they&rsquo;re having difficulty getting</p><p>pregnant and because they have PCOS what</p><p>do they do</p><p>say it again someone&rsquo;s having difficulty</p><p>getting pregnant because they have PCOS</p><p>what would you suggest that they do keto</p><p>an intermittent fasting good did I get</p><p>it right you got that right that time</p><p>okay now the thing is because then that</p><p>crib um are the veggie alternatives to</p><p>me good for me uh usually not because</p><p>they use like soy protein isolates and</p><p>processed garbage I don&rsquo;t like them</p><p>sorry don&rsquo;t you know don&rsquo;t hide feelings</p><p>dr. Burton I won&rsquo;t mince my words say</p><p>what you feel about it</p><p>okay okay um okay good</p><p>so can kedo help autistic symptoms no we</p><p>don&rsquo;t cure anything well it&rsquo;s illegal to</p><p>cure nobody can cure anything</p><p>that being said symptoms that are</p><p>sometimes also observable with people</p><p>who have that diagnosis of autism if</p><p>someone else had similar symptoms to</p><p>that would keto and intermittent fasting</p><p>have any effect whatsoever on those</p><p>symptoms here&rsquo;s what I would do I would</p><p>totally do that I would put your child</p><p>on that I would also do depending on the</p><p>age I would really try to do</p><p>a little bit longer intermittent fasting</p><p>simply because the better</p><p>huh if it said that but I&rsquo;m tired look</p><p>you should do C do some research</p><p>yourself on the cost link between</p><p>vitamin in autism and I think you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna find some fascinating data all</p><p>right</p><p>okay green hair this guy says visceral</p><p>fat and liver solution she diet should I</p><p>follow number fat and liver selection</p><p>okay let&rsquo;s ask you that let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s ask</p><p>everybody here&rsquo;s the first place house</p><p>visceral fat and a liver situation what</p><p>kind of diet should they follow yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s the first question</p><p>put your answer down below what kind of</p><p>someone has belly fat who gets it right</p><p>yeah okay</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching your videos for two</p><p>weeks unless 25 kilograms into it that&rsquo;s</p><p>amazing</p><p>immanuel immanuel you&rsquo;re doing great</p><p>good job okay everyone is saying you</p><p>know and I have you guys are so smart</p><p>now listen</p><p>oh that there&rsquo;s a bad connection this</p><p>last time we&rsquo;re gonna say it there is a</p><p>bad connection for some of you because</p><p>we only have this little telephone</p><p>though but look everybody&rsquo;s key</p><p>intermittent fasting keto i have keto i</p><p>have you guys are very smart well done</p><p>guys</p><p>yeah i want to mention when talk a</p><p>little bit about yours about skincare</p><p>not your skin just skin in general okay</p><p>I was talking about age for skin i&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna talk about sagging skin i&rsquo;m about</p><p>wrinkles does that it hasn&rsquo;t been</p><p>interested in that topic anyone let&rsquo;s</p><p>see if they&rsquo;re interested I mean I can</p><p>talk about something else</p><p>we can talk about the vitamin D receptor</p><p>does nicotine affect your insulin</p><p>nicotine you know what that&rsquo;s a very</p><p>good question</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know that answer</p><p>good question good question mark came up</p><p>with a good one mark you stumped him</p><p>okay so we got we got one person that</p><p>wants me to talk about the skin two</p><p>three yes yes yes no no yes that&rsquo;s more</p><p>yeses than the nose take it away good</p><p>all right so there&rsquo;s three things that</p><p>you guys I&rsquo;m going three little little</p><p>reasons why the skin mic aging faster it</p><p>should and what you just you know</p><p>maintain your skin as long as possible</p><p>and I&rsquo;m talking about preventing aging</p><p>skin primarily there happens to be this</p><p>thing called</p><p>a GE age that&rsquo;s involved with aging skin</p><p>I know it&rsquo;s so profound it stands for</p><p>advanced glycated and products know</p><p>advanced glycation end-products so this</p><p>basically is a term a g e&ndash;&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p><p>compound that is created in your body</p><p>not a compound but it&rsquo;s a combination of</p><p>protein in sugar or sugar and fat and</p><p>oils in the bodies so in other words</p><p>your skin if you&rsquo;re consuming sugar with</p><p>protein or sugar with those combinations</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna start developing what&rsquo;s</p><p>called 8a GES and your skin is going to</p><p>get very rigid and loose and wrinkly and</p><p>old very fast so again this aligns with</p><p>what we&rsquo;ve been recommending for ever</p><p>but the the the magnitude of what sugar</p><p>does in your skin I mean it ages the</p><p>skin is so fast so that&rsquo;s one thing you</p><p>want to definitely avoid that</p><p>combination and your collagen will be</p><p>more resilient versus you know kind of</p><p>like old okay now okay I got two more</p><p>things</p><p>the next thing that you want to do you</p><p>want to do in a minute fasting and I&rsquo;ve</p><p>already talked about this a million</p><p>times but I would recommend if you</p><p>really want to see a boost in your skin</p><p>is is to really spike that a toffee I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry</p><p>spike it by doing periodic I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about once a week prolonged fasting I</p><p>would do the first one 48 hours and then</p><p>if you could eventually get up to 72</p><p>occasion that would be even better</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna notice your skin is gonna</p><p>start to really change in a big way but</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna start replacing all the IDI</p><p>damaged cells especially the skin cells</p><p>you&rsquo;ll stimulate stem cells are just</p><p>gonna help growth you&rsquo;re gonna look a</p><p>lot younger I&rsquo;m actually 73 Karen is 84</p><p>and and we can in tribute that prolonged</p><p>fasting now the third thing and then</p><p>I&rsquo;ll zip it okay okay you definitely</p><p>want to increase your cholesterol on</p><p>your diet because the skin cell walls</p><p>the brain the nervous system is all</p><p>built with cholesterol and if you don&rsquo;t</p><p>do enough cholesterol the skin dries out</p><p>so egg yolks would be the one of the</p><p>best ways to to give you that raw</p><p>material and then of course don&rsquo;t screw</p><p>it up with any other junk food because</p><p>that&rsquo;ll mess up the liver so those three</p><p>things do that for skin all right I was</p><p>gonna say um we have two friends you</p><p>only have two friends we only have two</p><p>friends and no we&rsquo;re not brother and</p><p>sister</p><p>Sultan no no we&rsquo;re married look more</p><p>alike when you you do as you together</p><p>we&rsquo;re married almost 30 years oh look</p><p>your pets right yeah look we have to</p><p>really watch what kind of have we</p><p>right okay so anyway but the two friends</p><p>that we have a green and Maryann yeah</p><p>right they have been on keto and I have</p><p>and they have dramatic dramatic change</p><p>in their skin yeah I mean their skin</p><p>they look so much younger just saw Irene</p><p>the other day and we were both like holy</p><p>cow you look 20 years younger she</p><p>literally her her skin just looks</p><p>beautiful yeah</p><p>mr. Moni yeah okay so now let&rsquo;s see if</p><p>this went away or if I was able to keep</p><p>it</p><p>oh yeah here Janey says intermittent</p><p>fasting makes my on phenomenon worse I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna die abetik mmm and yeah I guess</p><p>maybe you don&rsquo;t tell them what donphan</p><p>Bonin is and then what happens is that</p><p>when you wake up in the morning your</p><p>blood sugars are high and you didn&rsquo;t eat</p><p>anything</p><p>so all that long you fasted and sudden</p><p>your blood Sugar&rsquo;s spike it&rsquo;s called the</p><p>dawn phenomena now there&rsquo;s a couple</p><p>reasons for that</p><p>number one is that the liver could be</p><p>making more glucose from gluco neo</p><p>Genesis or it could be the cortisol</p><p>spike which is also then breaking down</p><p>protein and turn in book goes to because</p><p>cortisol spikes at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the</p><p>morning I have videos on this I think</p><p>the best thing to do is to number one</p><p>consume some apple cider vinegar before</p><p>you go to bed number one number to</p><p>increase your B vitamins especially be</p><p>one that&rsquo;s going to help your blood</p><p>Sugar&rsquo;s take chromium</p><p>and also workout in the morning I</p><p>promise it&rsquo;s just a temporary thing it&rsquo;s</p><p>going to go away it&rsquo;s an adjustment it</p><p>needs your livers adjusting it have to</p><p>do with insulin resistance it will go</p><p>away you just stick with it</p><p>but if you do these things take these</p><p>nutrients and even potassium as well you</p><p>will see that will improve more and more</p><p>and more okay good xylitol addicting no</p><p>no now here&rsquo;s a question for you Karen</p><p>can a senior apparent to if&rsquo; who&rsquo;s frail</p><p>and thin yes okay good all right next</p><p>question well you know anybody it&rsquo;s like</p><p>a child if you have someone who&rsquo;s in a</p><p>delicate condition either super young or</p><p>super old and frail you have to be very</p><p>careful you have to make sure they&rsquo;re</p><p>getting good nutrients you said you said</p><p>the magic word right there when you put</p><p>your parents that are older or your</p><p>grandparents that are frail whatever on</p><p>keto and if&rsquo; especially you&rsquo;re gonna see</p><p>tremendous improvements in their brain</p><p>function okay but if they&rsquo;re very thin</p><p>and you&rsquo;re concerned about them losing</p><p>weight well put up on two meals a day</p><p>and make sure those meals are nice and</p><p>big and nutrient-dense I mean I</p><p>guarantee if you put your parents or</p><p>grandparents on two meals a day they&rsquo;re</p><p>not gonna wither away and you know what</p><p>I found with my parents oh I have three</p><p>because I have step dad but as they got</p><p>older they ate less anyway they very</p><p>naturally ate less they were not eating</p><p>all through the day they were not</p><p>snacking at night although my mom did a</p><p>little tiny bit but their meals were</p><p>super small can I be transparent and be</p><p>totally upfront and honest are you</p><p>running for office or something yeah</p><p>that&rsquo;s funny yes please be honest I</p><p>think both of our parents the challenge</p><p>was they they like to snack now my</p><p>parents are changing their ways</p><p>but I will say like the typical thing</p><p>that they did is they had a lot of</p><p>snacks and between meals three meals at</p><p>least there was just frequent eating a</p><p>lot and then even when your mom was in</p><p>that home they what do they feed her</p><p>frequently right well that was a</p><p>different situation and she went to</p><p>skilled nursing and she had a huge</p><p>breakfast she they fed her and it&rsquo;s moon</p><p>fed her way more food than she ever</p><p>would have eaten at home like probably</p><p>five times yeah the amount of food and</p><p>then also there was a an afternoon snack</p><p>yeah right so this is nice might have</p><p>been four or five times a day and the</p><p>meals were massive yeah I know</p><p>okay so we want to take another question</p><p>here what do we got okay so what can 48</p><p>hours of fasting do to our body what can</p><p>I consume in the 48 hours okay so</p><p>fasting means nothing fasting means</p><p>you&rsquo;re not eating anything water other</p><p>than water and electrolytes</p><p>yeah you think salt tea supplements but</p><p>nothing else no food and then you could</p><p>you should check out because I mean</p><p>we&rsquo;ve covered it a couple times now but</p><p>you should check out the videos on</p><p>YouTube dr. Berg videos and he covers</p><p>the benefits of intermittent fasting you</p><p>can really if you missed it here earlier</p><p>you can go to those videos and watch</p><p>tons of videos to explain you know very</p><p>simply the benefits of intermittent</p><p>fasting huge</p><p>so I want to mention something too</p><p>because people say to me well how I</p><p>start and I said well you know read</p><p>about the foods that you need to take</p><p>out of your diet and then do</p><p>intermittent fasting and they</p><p>immediately think oh that means I can&rsquo;t</p><p>eat for days and days the number of</p><p>people that say oh I can&rsquo;t go you know I</p><p>am terrible at fasting long term I just</p><p>said you know I get hungry or I feel</p><p>woozy or whatever beginning in Iran</p><p>fasting just means no snacking right and</p><p>so you start with three meals no snow</p><p>now some of you this might be hard to</p><p>believe I know you&rsquo;re gonna tell me that</p><p>because it&rsquo;s some of your sitting out</p><p>there and you might even have a</p><p>difficult time avoiding snacks at night</p><p>if I&rsquo;m talking to you go ahead and let</p><p>me know but if you&rsquo;re a if you want a</p><p>couple tips on you know that late-night</p><p>snack errs and I think that that&rsquo;s</p><p>really the biggest problem is the late</p><p>night snacking

that</p><p>video where we had when our kids were</p><p>and we would spray the gymnema on their</p><p>tongue and then you bought ding-dongs</p><p>and Oreos and all these things and did a</p><p>video of them tasting they were so</p><p>excited they were gonna be able to eat</p><p>the junk food and they put it in their</p><p>mouth and one-for-one the kids were</p><p>spitting it out because it&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t</p><p>realize how much the sugar is all of the</p><p>flavor it&rsquo;s all of the flavor in</p><p>anything you can do with alcohol you can</p><p>do it with anything sweet it basically</p><p>will stop your addiction to sweets</p><p>number one number two you can brush your</p><p>teeth that seems to really ruin</p><p>the urge to want to eat some you should</p><p>try that the

do with</p><p>vitamins</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s a big reveal let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been working on this for a very long</p><p>time and I&rsquo;m finally finally gonna</p><p>release it it&rsquo;s gonna be very very cool</p><p>cool information so you definitely want</p><p>to come to the summit just for that</p><p>alone yeah so the summit is August 31st</p><p>and September 1st in the DC area and you</p><p>can go to the website and find out all</p><p>about it dr. Berg comm definitely come</p><p>okay someone says you guys are awesome</p><p>your videos have had a very positive</p><p>effect in my life that&rsquo;s nice well thank</p><p>you which hour which the hour okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s great</p><p>hoarse for no reason eight hours and all</p><p>they found was low vitamin D levels of</p><p>16 blah blah guard to start of take</p><p>fifty thousand yeah okay so here&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing course I I have a video on this</p><p>what horst is how to get rid of</p><p>hoarseness in your throat</p><p>yes vitamin D is gonna be a good idea</p><p>but you want to do acupressure in fact I</p><p>did a video on doing Ellen Karen and it</p><p>was amazing so I would watch the video</p><p>it just typed dr. Bergin hoarseness and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll show you how to get rid of it okay</p><p>someone asked about psoriasis there are</p><p>two main nutrient deficiencies in</p><p>psoriasis one is vitamin d which you</p><p>need a lot of probably at least thirty</p><p>to forty thousand i use per day</p><p>don&rsquo;t forget the k2 and then secondly is</p><p>zinc nearly all cases of psoriasis are</p><p>zinc deficient so zinc and vitamin D in</p><p>a minute fasting is awesome and I just</p><p>want to say something about zinc zinc is</p><p>involved in a thousand enzymes</p><p>I mean it&rsquo;s intimately involved in so</p><p>many different things in fact it&rsquo;s</p><p>always low when you have alopecia which</p><p>is like a hairy next question yeah I</p><p>picked it up hair coming out of your</p><p>head</p><p>you know different patches it&rsquo;s</p><p>autoimmune it&rsquo;s always low and ulcers in</p><p>patches ulcers you&rsquo;re gonna see though</p><p>think acne you&rsquo;re gonna see those ink</p><p>and also if you don&rsquo;t have enough think</p><p>your thymus is gonna atrophy I bet you</p><p>didn&rsquo;t know that your thymus is a little</p><p>gland on top of the heart and that was a</p><p>training camp for your white blood your</p><p>white blood cells so zinc is like really</p><p>really important and by the way if you</p><p>have a candida candida competes and it</p><p>steals your zinc and you need same for</p><p>your immune system so if you have</p><p>Candida you better be taking zinc or</p><p>else your means this one will be weak</p><p>and can&rsquo;t and your system can&rsquo;t fight</p><p>off they can&rsquo;t either</p><p>that was that should be a video because</p><p>that was a lot of them for me I gave a</p><p>lot of information and it&rsquo;s like two</p><p>sentences you have to watch this over</p><p>again to get all that information okay</p><p>so speaking of alopecia yeah Andrew</p><p>wants to know does sugar affect the</p><p>immune system suppressing hair growth</p><p>are they related the immune system and</p><p>hair growth or is it something</p><p>completely different than suppresses</p><p>hair growth sugar suppresses the immune</p><p>system sugar suppresses the also it</p><p>increases insulin which then increases</p><p>androgens as one side effect of too much</p><p>energy would be hair loss hmm male</p><p>pattern baldness polycystic ovarian</p><p>syndrome so it&rsquo;s very very hard to you</p><p>know have your body work with with too</p><p>much sugar and especially like even like</p><p>the insulin resistance because you can&rsquo;t</p><p>absorb amino acids that well if you have</p><p>insulin resistance so yeah there&rsquo;s a</p><p>connection there for sure okay how much</p><p>zinc honestly what I would like I would</p><p>recommend is I would probably do 10</p><p>milligrams a day and I&rsquo;m going on the</p><p>low side just because you know you can</p><p>overdo it so you don&rsquo;t want to like do</p><p>too much just do a little bit of zing</p><p>without zinc all you lose the sense</p><p>in taste oh yeah so do starchy foods</p><p>like rice and potatoes become low</p><p>glycemic when refrigerated for 12 to 24</p><p>hours before eating somebody&rsquo;s really</p><p>busy looking for a way to eat rice and</p><p>potatoes no but if you actually rinse it</p><p>really well underneath water cold water</p><p>all the starch goes away and then you</p><p>can eat it he&rsquo;s joking no you have to</p><p>put it under hot water and then it on</p><p>your head yeah hop around it three times</p><p>no I&rsquo;m sorry if someone gave you that</p><p>information</p><p>don&rsquo;t listen to them in the future that</p><p>is there&rsquo;s nothing today all right</p><p>Lily&rsquo;s 1/2 a chocolate bar during you</p><p>know is okay yeah it&rsquo;s okay not a</p><p>problem</p><p>it has it&rsquo;s low sugars in that one I</p><p>have memory loss brain fog only 18 years</p><p>old</p><p>well if you have memory problems at that</p><p>age it tells me you have a serious</p><p>problem with insulin resistance and it&rsquo;s</p><p>affecting the brain already so you need</p><p>to do the healthy keto Nana fasting very</p><p>very fast because that&rsquo;s gonna switch</p><p>things around here&rsquo;s the thing that I</p><p>was gonna mention about IQ there are</p><p>certain minerals that you need to get</p><p>your to make sure your IQ is peaked out</p><p>or maximized iodine is one of them</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re pregnant you should</p><p>be having enough iodine and selenium</p><p>the infant can come out with a lower IQ</p><p>you&rsquo;re deficient the other thing you got</p><p>to be careful about is fluoride fluoride</p><p>is very toxic to a pea in a small child</p><p>it&rsquo;s not a sensual mineral that people</p><p>think about like it&rsquo;s not an essential</p><p>thing it actually can drop a child&rsquo;s IQ</p><p>Jen Janet and Traci ounce anyway here no</p><p>no it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m talking about the flooring</p><p>and the water I&rsquo;m talking about the</p><p>Florida in the toothpaste you got to be</p><p>very careful with kids taking</p><p>taking in toxic amounts can affect their</p><p>enamel but mainly by Q so I would get a</p><p>nice good filter on your water filter</p><p>system and filter it out and do fluoride</p><p>free toothpaste so your child could be</p><p>very smart Oh mad fasting with</p><p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s Wow well it&rsquo;s Oh mad what</p><p>kita</p><p>fasting one meal a day well one one is</p><p>that&rsquo;s right one meal a day is fasting</p><p>it&rsquo;s working right now and then we&rsquo;ll</p><p>just take a couple questions there&rsquo;s two</p><p>types of Hashimoto&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m sorry two types</p><p>of when does house you notice one is</p><p>just regular hypothyroidism immune in</p><p>which case yes why one day prolonged</p><p>fasting is the secret to helping that</p><p>condition a lot of antioxidants too</p><p>because that can actually improve things</p><p>take it to the next level</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna go they can it&rsquo;s gonna happen</p><p>possibly as it&rsquo;s gonna freeze again and</p><p>then we&rsquo;re this before you say goodbye</p><p>we appreciate you guys with all these</p><p>questions and next week it&rsquo;ll be a lot</p><p>better and thank you for putting up with</p><p>this not quality video alright let&rsquo;s</p><p>let&rsquo;s go through a couple more questions</p><p>[Music]</p><p>keto rash is that different than diaper</p><p>rash it&rsquo;s very different with diaper</p><p>rash you weeks</p><p>Kito rash</p><p>you just take some B vitamins and boom</p><p>go the other one zinc zinc cream that&rsquo;s</p><p>right</p><p>we love you too all right once you</p><p>recommend recommendation conferred big</p><p>ticket cute thing is basically that</p><p>vitamin D is good</p><p>intermittent fasting is really really</p><p>key Lokar moderate fiber moderate fiber</p><p>uncle crazy all right let&rsquo;s see you that</p><p>dry fasting you know I think you got it</p><p>careful you get it because you&rsquo;re now</p><p>you&rsquo;re eliminating tones you can</p><p>increase more your cat it could worsen</p><p>things but that being said some people</p><p>have experienced incredible results with</p><p>dry fasting so I think that if you&rsquo;re in</p><p>a pretty good health and you&rsquo;ve already</p><p>done the fasting for a period of time</p><p>okay so April says why do my feet swell</p><p>while on</p><p>[Music]</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t add potassium I would</p><p>actually add my electrolyte but the</p><p>potassium</p><p>it just means you need more vegetables</p><p>and you might need some more B vitamins</p><p>is 10,000 IU is I&rsquo;m gonna detox this</p><p>little teaches at 3000 I use dangerous</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a separate video on this</p><p>guys but that&rsquo;s based on an arbitrary</p><p>thing it&rsquo;s absolutely they&rsquo;re trying to</p><p>be eight on that is is really not</p><p>exactly accurate and the other thing is</p><p>like it was like one person had a major</p><p>problem by taking large amounts of</p><p>vitamin D but it wasn&rsquo;t even from cows</p><p>it was from sepsis and infection and I</p><p>want to do a whole video just to make</p><p>this very complete but no it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s</p><p>not dangerous taking</p><p>and I use you get twenty thousand I use</p><p>from from sunlight from being out there</p><p>half hour so yeah it&rsquo;s not gonna be a</p><p>problem especially if you&rsquo;re taking k2</p><p>okay here&rsquo;s one</p><p>oh man add breakfast Oh Matt if you</p><p>don&rsquo;t know is one meal a day nuts and</p><p>seeds a meal and fruits what&rsquo;s your</p><p>opinion dr. Berg what to eat first</p><p>like it just to avoid the fruit in the</p><p>oatmeal and you&rsquo;ll be good to go and</p><p>then avoid the entire meal because</p><p>breakfast is not the most important meal</p><p>of the day</p><p>if you</p><p>this cadet a flame never eat unless</p><p>you&rsquo;re hungry that&rsquo;s answer to more</p><p>questions okay make sure they&rsquo;re really</p><p>good though not me so it&rsquo;s a soy</p><p>fermented soy you could do it just me</p><p>thank you dr. Byrd we&rsquo;ve been listening</p><p>to with home you instance that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>it&rsquo;s great that&rsquo;s really good</p><p>we tried to push it but we&rsquo;re gonna have</p><p>one less question okay someone say</p><p>someone takes a diet pill you take diet</p><p>pills mm-hmm to suppress their appetite</p><p>does that interfere with intermittent</p><p>fasting absolutely yeah do that it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna you don&rsquo;t need you don&rsquo;t need the</p><p>diet pill so you absolutely don&rsquo;t you</p><p>can do this without diet pills you can</p><p>do this naturally it works you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>see the results we have tens I mean</p><p>literally tens of thousands of successes</p><p>they could just roll in they&rsquo;re just</p><p>amazed so amazing so listen guys I know</p><p>that I we&rsquo;re cutting it short but I want</p><p>to thank you your your attention yeah</p><p>interest your wonderful comments thanks</p><p>for putting up with this really awkward</p><p>fuzzy poor a video quality video but we</p><p>hope that you got some questions</p><p>answered and you&rsquo;re inspired to keep key</p><p>toeing and I f&rsquo;ing till next week yes</p><p>have a great weekend guys</p><p>we&rsquo;ll see it okay bye bye</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
