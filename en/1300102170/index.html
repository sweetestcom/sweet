<p>i got one of my dogs from a</p>
<p>breeder man i am not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with breeders people talk shit</p>
<p>about breeders but if the guy&rsquo;s a passionate</p>
<p>breeder and really</p>
<p>breeds dogs because he wants like a good be</p>
<p>my dog is awesome dude</p>
<p>and one of the reasons why he&rsquo;s awesome is because his</p>
<p>dad was awesome his dad was one of the security dogs</p>
<p>on fear factor</p>
<p>we had him bite people in these big</p>
<p>crazy bite suits</p>
<p>and his dog was so cool he was just chill</p>
<p>hanging out with everybody not douchey do the</p>
<p>other dogs he</p>
<p>was just the</p>
<p>sweetest dog come over to him man what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>meanwhile he&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>giant mastiff and i&rsquo;m like what a</p>
<p>great dog he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>friendly and like such a difference</p>
<p>genuinely affectionate like come up and rub</p>
<p>against you and love it when you rub his head</p>
<p>like how crazy</p>
<p>does his dog get this perfect personality well this guy</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t let his douchebags breed</p>
<p>he just anytime</p>
<p>he goes i love them i take care of them but no</p>
<p>breeding for you you fuck</p>
<p>and he takes them and he</p>
<p>takes all the douchebags out so he&rsquo;s done this for like</p>
<p>20 generations so his dogs are like the coolest dogs</p>
<p>like i come over his</p>
<p>house he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>these big fucking mastiffs like</p>
<p>the chicks like a buck 30 and the males like a buck 50</p>
<p>and they come up to you like okay</p>
<p>these are lions</p>
<p>these are these</p>
<p>small lions</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>assuming you have control over</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m walking in your</p>
<p>house and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trusting my balls and my legs</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trusting all my soft</p>
<p>tissue to these</p>
<p>monsters that you have</p>
<p>under your control</p>
<p>the dogs couldn&rsquo;t have been more chill</p>
<p>just like hey how you doing</p>
<p>come not not like</p>
<p>checking you out like what&rsquo;s up bitch</p>
<p>what the fuck you doing around here not</p>
<p>sniffing you all aggro</p>
<p>like some of them will disrespect you with a sniff</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like letting you know</p>
<p>bitch i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna sniff your dick right now</p>
<p>just like get it on your dick</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going aggro on you man they&rsquo;re pulling some</p>
<p>alpha male shit</p>
<p>you gotta step in and stop them from doing that</p>
<p>these dogs were nothing like that man</p>
<p>these dogs were so cool they just had this air</p>
<p>about them like hi</p>
<p>hi come on in</p>
<p>meanwhile they</p>
<p>would do bite work like he</p>
<p>would have these dudes in a suit and they</p>
<p>would hold them back and then let the dog loose</p>
<p>it was like a meat cannon</p>
<p>like you shot a side of beef with this dude&rsquo;s arm</p>
<p>that they would just</p>
<p>latch out of the guy and</p>
<p>bring him down i&rsquo;m like what a</p>
<p>crazy thing you&rsquo;ve engineered</p>
<p>this dog that will respond to your</p>
<p>every command is</p>
<p>super intelligent</p>
<p>and is gigantic</p>
<p>and can mimic</p>
<p>the primal attack mode</p>
<p>and then shut it off and shut it</p>
<p>right off and be</p>
<p>super friendly do</p>
<p>physically exactly what he&rsquo;s designed to do to kill</p>
<p>dude that impressed</p>
<p>the that was the most impressive</p>
<p>thing to me when</p>
<p>we were on fear factors what people have done with dog</p>
<p>breeding and dog training</p>
<p>like dogs that really know</p>
<p>their shit they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>impressive man that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impressive like they</p>
<p>had they have it locked down</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving them</p>
<p>treats and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>setting them up and they&rsquo;re giving them</p>
<p>their affection and they&rsquo;re giving them</p>
<p>their recognition for what they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>these dogs will</p>
<p>do anything they&rsquo;ll do whatever the fuck you say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty nuts that we figured out a way to do that</p>
<p>i always think it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>funny that people will i</p>
<p>totally love and respect people</p>
<p>rescuing animals i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>thing that people do</p>
<p>and then you know there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other people who will buy like a</p>
<p>budget animal</p>
<p>you know which is</p>
<p>definitely coming from a bad</p>
<p>place if you</p>
<p>buy like a dog for like 100 bucks</p>
<p>sometimes people</p>
<p>just fall in love too</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s sometimes people</p>
<p>see a dog like</p>
<p>a dog yeah but you you know they expect</p>
<p>great results it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>place where they had a</p>
<p>like twenty five dollar</p>
<p>tattoos you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have this for a long time like</p>
<p>make a good investment yeah but some</p>
<p>people just say but it&rsquo;s a dog what could be</p>
<p>wrong with it i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had a bunch of dogs with like i had this bulldog</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had to have a bunch</p>
<p>brian just killed my mom sorry</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a hip dysplasia</p>
<p>so he had i have to get both his arms operated</p>
<p>and it was like six</p>
<p>grand man it was like it&rsquo;s like serious</p>
<p>money so i was like eighteen thousand dollars i</p>
<p>think for both of his arms had have one operation</p>
<p>and they had have one like a</p>
<p>while later and then they were talking</p>
<p>about replacing his back hips</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like listen this dog is lazy as fuck</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to do that people</p>
<p>stuff this dog just likes to</p>
<p>chill like you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>like yeah he walks around a bit of a limp but he seems</p>
<p>happy like he</p>
<p>might be a little pain but most of the time he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>chilling you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a running dog he&rsquo;s a bulldog he&rsquo;s just gonna</p>
<p>relax you know</p>
<p>okay he&rsquo;s fucked up you don&rsquo;t have to give him</p>
<p>metal hips all right just</p>
<p>let him be fucked up</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a dog that was</p>
<p>given to me if that if that it was a situation</p>
<p>is a situation</p>
<p>if they wasn&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>would have never wanted to get a dog like that i</p>
<p>would know i</p>
<p>would look for dogs</p>
<p>that have a genetic propensity for hip dysplasia and</p>
<p>stuff like that and you</p>
<p>gotta you gotta</p>
<p>think man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wonderful to love a dog and take care of them</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re adopting a</p>
<p>giant bag of</p>
<p>fucking problems with some animals you know</p>
<p>if you get them from a good</p>
<p>breeder you know what the fuck you&rsquo;re getting</p>

<p>just haunts it</p>
<p>it sits there it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>stock it and</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;ll just pounce and then i&rsquo;ll grab it in its</p>
<p>mouth and throw it up in the air</p>

<p>you know one</p>
<p>generation removed so it&rsquo;s a serval</p>

<p>breeder i got it from they</p>
<p>keep they&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>it so long it&rsquo;s mostly savannah to savannah made what</p>
<p>exactly is a serval</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this wild looking mini cheetah</p>
<p>with really long legs it&rsquo;s a wild animal</p>
<p>fully wild so</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t train</p>
<p>those at all</p>
<p>no those are</p>
<p>those are just</p>
<p>those are just gone</p>
<p>i mean they live</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pictures from the</p>
<p>breeder the servals with the children and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>they hang out all</p>
<p>right there was a fear factor</p>
<p>show that we did once</p>
<p>and it was in this</p>
<p>really rural area really rural</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>these people were like</p>
<p>living outward there was no one out there</p>
<p>and one woman</p>
<p>had a dog that got fucked by a coyote</p>
<p>and how is half coyote</p>
<p>half dog puppies it was a trip</p>
<p>dude it was a trip</p>
<p>they were all huddled together because it was</p>
<p>freezing cold a</p>
<p>bunch of the cast or the crew rather took them home</p>
<p>as pets because everybody was so</p>
<p>heartbroken</p>
<p>because it was</p>
<p>really cold outside we were filming in the winter</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re up in like this really</p>
<p>high altitude area it&rsquo;s cold as fuck</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these puppies all huddled up together</p>
<p>like shaking and they&rsquo;re half coyote man</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>some dog got fucked by some murderous</p>
<p>beast from the woods</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>when a dog gets fucked by a coyote that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be some</p>
<p>trippy shit</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s crazy about</p>
<p>those hyenas</p>
<p>that people use</p>
<p>those dogs you</p>
<p>know i wonder if though i wonder if a dog fucks coyote</p>
<p>if a coyote</p>
<p>fucks a dog</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it is usually probably</p>
<p>i bet it&rsquo;s not dogs fucking coyote i don&rsquo;t know one of</p>
<p>those big i bet it&rsquo;s a man</p>
<p>do you think so no i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;d kill it i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;d kill it yeah</p>
<p>i think they have a war they</p>
<p>would go to</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but a male gets to fuck a dog</p>
<p>the males can fuck the dogs right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so creepy man yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i wonder if the dogs can go back to regular dogs</p>
<p>after that or</p>
<p>they just get</p>
<p>used the most</p>
<p>coyote fucked</p>
<p>have you ever seen a coyote&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mouth when they open their jaws</p>
<p>dude there&rsquo;s like rows of</p>
<p>teeth like a crocodile that shit goes back</p>
<p>like the first time i saw a coyote yawn</p>
<p>i was like whoa hold on like</p>
<p>you start thinking they&rsquo;re dogs</p>
<p>and then you see a coyote</p>
<p>yawn you like you&rsquo;ve got like 20</p>
<p>extra teeth you fuck yeah</p>
<p>those are scary creepy fucking murderers</p>
<p>sneaking in and fucking your dog</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dude that runs down lake in austin</p>
<p>which is a big</p>
<p>big jogging</p>
<p>trail he has</p>
<p>three wolves four</p>
<p>wolves and he just pretends that they&rsquo;re not wolves but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re beautiful</p>
<p>creatures but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little iffy</p>
<p>yeah i have a friend who has one</p>
<p>he has one and</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>thing got out and killed a gang of goats</p>
<p>killed like got out of his he has like a</p>
<p>ranch and he got from his</p>
<p>ranch and went into the neighbors</p>
<p>ranch and just</p>
<p>started jacking</p>
<p>their animals</p>
<p>just fucking up</p>
<p>everything a little too much</p>
<p>well had a blood orgy</p>
<p>just went over there that he</p>
<p>found a pen that was filled with goats</p>
<p>so he jumped into this pen and</p>
<p>started just</p>
<p>tearing these goats</p>
<p>apart it was big</p>
<p>hundred and</p>
<p>sixty hundred and</p>
<p>seventy pounds</p>
<p>just ripping them apart</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like bro you don&rsquo;t have control of this fucking</p>
<p>thing man like you</p>
<p>gotta be careful</p>
<p>so what does he do</p>
<p>he moves to hollywood</p>
<p>brings his wolf</p>
<p>three of them</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got three of them this douchebag</p>
<p>living in the fucking hollywood hills this</p>
<p>thing&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>killing deer and shit</p>
<p>i heard wolves aren&rsquo;t even good</p>
<p>for home invasion</p>
<p>either well it&rsquo;s like if you come into home</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not territorially protected because</p>
<p>they have those</p>
<p>wide ranges not like</p>
<p>other dogs so</p>
<p>i mean a burglar</p>
<p>murder can come</p>
<p>in your home and do whatever and it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but if it threatens you apparently</p>
<p>then the wolf will</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll protect you it&rsquo;ll protect you yeah</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re his buddy</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not his dad</p>
<p>yeah okay that&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re his buddy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>know if your roommate is getting attacked you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna jump in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>if your son was getting attacked okay</p>
<p>you know or</p>
<p>you know if your father was getting attacked rather</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how dogs are dogs look at you like your dad</p>
<p>with a wolf you just like what&rsquo;s up man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got fucking with you</p>
<p>and the wolf like yo yo yo get that shit out of here</p>

<p>population so</p>
<p>small now they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel it the strength to fuck with people right yeah</p>
<p>they will fuck up your crops or your cattle though</p>
<p>if you have cows</p>
<p>or if you have any animals they will fuck them up man</p>
<p>them and mountain lions</p>
<p>i was a kid once and i was reading this</p>
<p>comic book and it was i used to read a lot of creepy</p>
<p>and eerie do you remember those comic books</p>
<p>do you remember those at all</p>
<p>creepy and eerie were these</p>
<p>really cool</p>
<p>comic books that were like</p>
<p>black and white</p>
<p>really cool illustrations and it was all like</p>
<p>monster stories</p>
<p>and one of them was</p>
<p>about this werewolf</p>
<p>that was sneaking into these</p>
<p>people had sheep and they were</p>
<p>living in the old west or some shit and they had sheep</p>
<p>and the werewolf</p>
<p>would sneak into</p>
<p>their pen and kill all the sheep</p>
<p>and then the guy</p>
<p>goes out there and he gets attacked by this werewolf</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like wow how</p>
<p>crazy would that be if a werewolf was out there</p>
<p>sneaking into people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pens and killing all</p>
<p>their animals and i thought about it</p>
<p>just cheetahs</p>
<p>cheetahs do do that</p>
<p>mountain lions do do that all the time</p>
<p>they got a real</p>
<p>if you live anywhere</p>
<p>near mountain lion and you have animals in your yard</p>
<p>you got a that</p>
<p>those are that&rsquo;s game yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna just hop over</p>
<p>that fence and kill them and drag them in the woods</p>
<p>why is it any</p>
<p>why is a wolfman any scarier than that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe because it can</p>
<p>have sex with you</p>
<p>yeah the wolfman</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t all the twilight</p>
<p>movies that&rsquo;s for sure</p>
<p>oh yeah are</p>
<p>those guys technically werewolf so</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know because they just become</p>
<p>wolves metro</p>
<p>wolves you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying they don&rsquo;t become a werewolf they become a wolf</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s kind of gay</p>
<p>that is like you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take the time to</p>
<p>morph be something cool and new</p>
<p>you know be</p>
<p>some american werewolf in london type hybrid shit</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just be a dog team wolf killed that</p>
<p>whole thing now</p>
<p>after team wolf to me like oh it&rsquo;s a werewolf</p>
<p>guy you know</p>
<p>teen wolf killed him for yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fucking michael j fox is not</p>
<p>scary or that did twilight kill it for you for</p>
<p>vampires no</p>
<p>vampires were</p>
<p>already killed for me a long time ago dude</p>
<p>if you think</p>
<p>vampires are killed</p>
<p>go watch gary oldman and do dracula</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying though but then also</p>
<p>watch the million</p>
<p>other tv shows and fucking knock offs</p>
<p>totally but if gary oldman came out</p>
<p>today with a new dracula</p>
<p>he could rock that shit and you&rsquo;d be believing in</p>
<p>vampires again but now</p>
<p>wolfman not too much wolfman&rsquo;s done i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s done i</p>
<p>think that last one with</p>
<p>benicio del toro that killed it for me i&rsquo;m a wolf man</p>
<p>fan bro and i couldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked</p>

<p>many times on the podcast i have wolfman fetishes</p>
<p>i have some</p>
<p>crazy fucking werewolf</p>
<p>thing man i don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>ever since i was a little kid</p>
<p>loved werewolf</p>
<p>movies yeah</p>
<p>just like the idea that showed some</p>
<p>sketches you were drawing werewolves yeah yeah yeah</p>

<p>school a lot</p>
<p>of them are like from when i was like 12 and 13</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucked up</p>
<p>they tap into something primal and</p>
<p>joe rogan some fucking part of me like that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>moved to the woods man there&rsquo;s some part of me that</p>
<p>wants to be out</p>
<p>with animals has anybody seen joe rogan on a full moon</p>
<p>right it ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that why is he</p>
<p>tweeting at 6am</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because i can&rsquo;t live in the jungle</p>
<p>if i could live in the jungle i&rsquo;d live in the jungle</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no jungle in america so i choose the woods</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i really</p>
<p>would like to</p>
<p>be just living around animals and shit well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got to represent some primal part of all of us you know</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s something there&rsquo;s some energy i</p>
<p>think that you get this</p>
<p>sounds so hippy faggy bullshit</p>
<p>ever so true man</p>
<p>just like certain</p>
<p>energy cat when you&rsquo;re around</p>
<p>these animals like</p>
<p>one of the people that i</p>
<p>lived near up there was this</p>
<p>crazy yoga lady very nice lady but</p>
<p>crazy yoga lady</p>
<p>and i was talking to her</p>
<p>about like mountain lions i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>listen then</p>
<p>how do you guys deal with the fact</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s mountain lions because there&rsquo;s a fucking corner</p>
<p>store up there</p>
<p>that had a sign</p>
<p>that if you get attacked by a bear</p>
<p>you should play dead</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re attacked by a mountain lion you</p>
<p>should fight back i&rsquo;m like what the fuck</p>
<p>you have strategies to deal with</p>
<p>different monsters jacking you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna play dead</p>
<p>by a bear is biting the fuck out of you really that</p>
<p>stuff you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>gonna do that</p>
<p>are you gonna be able to do that holy shit</p>
<p>so i said how do you deal</p>
<p>with this how do you deal with the fact that you around</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>beasts she was</p>
<p>i just let them all in</p>
<p>when i walk through the woods i let them know</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>among you i&rsquo;m no threat i love</p>
<p>i love you and i love them and i just walk through</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve never had a problem like</p>
<p>bitch you&rsquo;ve been so lucky</p>
<p>you zigged when you could have</p>
<p>zagged and you</p>
<p>could have walked</p>
<p>right onto a</p>
<p>mother cougar</p>
<p>protected or young</p>
<p>you could have</p>
<p>fucked up and</p>
<p>walked into a fucking grizzly bear</p>
<p>and it could have been with its cobs and</p>
<p>freaked out decide to eat your face</p>
<p>you got lucky</p>
<p>yeah you see well you see all</p>
<p>those documentaries</p>
<p>who hang out with</p>
<p>these predators long enough</p>
<p>why do people</p>
<p>think that they are better than deer why do you</p>
<p>think that if there&rsquo;s love in nature why does</p>
<p>there really it&rsquo;s all love</p>
<p>why does nature let this murderous cougar</p>
<p>snap this deer&rsquo;s fucking neck and suck the</p>
<p>blood out and then eat its guts first</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s what they do they go guts</p>
<p>first cause they don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>grass they get</p>
<p>their vegetation by eating the guts of the</p>
<p>things they kill</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t happen to you</p>
<p>why would it happen to the deer not to you</p>
<p>does that you really get</p>
<p>think the universe gives a fuck</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re around a predator</p>
<p>and it wants to eat and it looks at you and says</p>
<p>i think i ate one of</p>
<p>these back in the nineties</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll try it</p>
<p>again it was good yeah i only get a hiker once</p>
<p>every ten years</p>
<p>but fuck it</p>
<p>yeah they got that muesli in their</p>
<p>system yeah dude</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll jack you</p>
<p>especially when they get used to it like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an area i talked</p>
<p>about in my act</p>
<p>an area in india called the</p>
<p>sunder bands</p>
<p>and they have a real problem with</p>
<p>tigers there because the</p>
<p>tigers have gotten used to eating people</p>
<p>the tsunamis or the typhoons rather</p>
<p>they wash a lot of</p>
<p>bodies into the river</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>drown these are the fucking villagers man</p>
<p>these people are really poor</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>shacks on the</p>
<p>river in india</p>
<p>and the tigers eat the</p>
<p>bodies that drown</p>
<p>and so they get a</p>
<p>taste of human</p>
<p>flash and they just</p>
<p>start jacking people</p>
<p>just jacking people</p>
<p>ghost in the dark you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go anywhere yeah</p>
<p>bro there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>videos on youtube and look this up</p>
<p>folks if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at home or when you get home you</p>
<p>gotta check out</p>
<p>sunder bands</p>
<p>tigers there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of cool documentaries online and one of them</p>
<p>these poor fucks</p>
<p>these guys are census takers</p>
<p>so they have to find out how many</p>
<p>these murderous</p>
<p>monsters are out there in the tall grass</p>
<p>in the fucking tall grass</p>
<p>out on a boat</p>
<p>so what this guy this guy has a rifle</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a helmet on okay</p>
<p>and the helmet has a mask on the back of the head</p>
<p>because tigers like to</p>
<p>sneak up behind you and jack you</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you to see them come on they just want to jack you</p>
<p>so these guys are wearing helmets to protect themselves</p>
<p>from getting jacked by</p>
<p>monsters and they</p>
<p>have a mask with a fucking face on the back of the head</p>
<p>where the tigers figured it out</p>
<p>after a while that it was just a face</p>
<p>so he started jacking guys from the back anyway</p>
<p>even though they have</p>
<p>these face on a</p>
<p>bunch of dudes the census</p>
<p>takers get killed by</p>
<p>tigers with fucking masks on</p>
<p>so now they&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>these things can swim</p>
<p>so they have to make sure</p>
<p>their boat has an engine</p>
<p>so they can swim faster than the tiger can</p>
<p>they can run 50</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve killed</p>
<p>300 000 people in the last 200 years that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d think that someone</p>
<p>would take up the challenge and be like all</p>
<p>right tigers</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re smarter</p>
<p>oh fucking dude people</p>
<p>are like you know hey they&rsquo;re a part of nature yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re part of nature in some regards are</p>
<p>right i mean what makes us that much better i mean</p>
<p>because we have the guns this is</p>
<p>ridiculous we don&rsquo;t need them around it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>stupid kill them all what are you crazy</p>
<p>the people in india</p>
<p>should be we are</p>
<p>worried about the extinction of the tigers</p>
<p>you should be</p>
<p>worried you</p>
<p>should be worried</p>
<p>about your fucking</p>
<p>your murderous master</p>
<p>that lives in the jungle yeah you got to keep it</p>
<p>alive it&rsquo;s your god</p>
<p>are you crazy</p>
<p>are you fucking that attached</p>
<p>these animals</p>
<p>that want to kill people good just gun them down man</p>
<p>gun them or put</p>
<p>human masks on the back of the</p>
<p>tigers and really confuse everything</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>gonna do brian you</p>
<p>gonna find the</p>
<p>tiger and put a mask on it you fuck</p>
<p>how dare you just</p>
<p>did you try to</p>
<p>trick the tigers out</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m saying it would confuse everything you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be people with</p>
<p>tiger mass on the back of their heads and</p>
<p>tigers with human mass if you could transfer</p>
<p>human consciousness into anything if you could transfer</p>
<p>human consciousness into</p>
<p>like an animal just to see what it&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>how dope would it be</p>
<p>to be able to download your fucking</p>
<p>brain into a tiger&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>and just live it moving that shit around</p>
<p>and running on the train</p>
<p>for sure how</p>
<p>fucking insane would that be man</p>
<p>if you could just control the body of a</p>
<p>tiger with a human mind and fuck other tigers</p>
<p>oh shit tiger shit</p>
<p>god damn how crazy</p>
<p>would that be you totally feel</p>
<p>right you know oh my god it feel perfect</p>
<p>fuck this and even when she freaks out you</p>
<p>like bitch i got this</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;ll allow her to intimidate you</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tiger and you&rsquo;ve got your dick inside of her</p>
<p>you have no fear</p>
<p>you have full control of this thing</p>
<p>blast for 20 seconds just</p>
<p>shoot loads into her</p>
<p>just shoot tiger loads into her</p>
<p>that would be insane man i would</p>
<p>think though if i had to choose i would take eagle</p>
<p>i would like to be an eagle</p>
<p>that would be the dopest</p>
<p>thing ever yeah cuz eagles get to jack fish from the</p>
<p>air yeah bro</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking national animal for a reason bro</p>
<p>have some respect</p>
<p>you know the turkey i&rsquo;m sure you know</p>
<p>the turkey was supposed to be our national animal</p>
<p>willing yeah benjamin</p>
<p>franklin was putting forward this is</p>
<p>turkeys turkeys the smartest bird</p>
<p>that would have made us less douchey</p>
<p>canada they have a maple leaf they&rsquo;re all like</p>
<p>chill up there</p>
<p>yeah yeah we&rsquo;re gonna fucking kill her bird</p>
<p>we eat once a year</p>
<p>an eagle oh</p>
<p>turkey yeah</p>
<p>we are not saying</p>
<p>if if we didn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>eagle maybe we wouldn&rsquo;t be so douchey</p>
<p>cause the eagle is such a douchey animal</p>
<p>he looks like what bitch</p>
<p>why would we want an eagle</p>
<p>first of all because eagles don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about anybody</p>
<p>you ever look into an eagle&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the pits of hell i cry they don&rsquo;t give a fuck about you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re holding them and feeding them</p>
<p>every day and they&rsquo;re a little</p>
<p>thing on your arm</p>
<p>and you get shot in the head with a howitzer</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go well i</p>
<p>guess i&rsquo;m not hanging out here anymore just fly away</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get sad</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel bad</p>
<p>those birds</p>
<p>a prayer trip there was a</p>
<p>hawk that landed on our</p>
<p>ranch and we knew something was off</p>
<p>with it because it was just hanging around the house</p>
<p>so my parents were like all</p>
<p>right we gotta try and</p>
<p>bring it in we</p>
<p>gotta try to get it to the</p>
<p>vet or something whoa</p>
<p>so they sent me with a</p>
<p>kitchen glove were they sure of</p>
<p>bullets yeah</p>
<p>they sent me with a kitchen</p>
<p>glove and a little piece of</p>
<p>steak get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>going very slowly like looking at this</p>
<p>hawk in the eye like</p>
<p>thinking of the options</p>
<p>do i fight do i run like</p>
<p>what happened god</p>
<p>but you know it turned out that it was a domesticated</p>
<p>hawk so i was able to give it to me</p>
<p>and then it dug it and then it hopped on the</p>
<p>kitchen glove</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>brought it into the</p>
<p>house and rescued it</p>

<p>that was probably some bitches</p>
<p>out there i was a real pink</p>
<p>i was pink way before that hoe</p>
<p>charlie chaplin was pink once</p>
<p>i was pink in the 80s</p>
<p>they ain&rsquo;t have no internet</p>

<p>she heard about me and created her own shit</p>
<p>check my name that</p>
<p>bitch check my name</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>whenever someone</p>
<p>famous gets famous there&rsquo;s always someone that thinks</p>
<p>that happens all the time</p>
<p>like oh he&rsquo;s got my whole act that&rsquo;s my whole routine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my i was doing that in the catskills i</p>
<p>taught him everything he knows i&rsquo;ve heard that</p>
<p>story so many times that a guy makes</p>
<p>it and then you go oh you know that guy made it but</p>
<p>there was a guy back in</p>
<p>like michigan</p>
<p>who was scared to</p>
<p>leave town but he was the guy he</p>
<p>learned from that guy like</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s like kramer there&rsquo;s a real kramer</p>
<p>you know kramer from seinfeld</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real dude he calls himself the real kramer</p>
<p>and he gives like tours of new york</p>
<p>he was like the guy that</p>
<p>burst through doors well i</p>
<p>guess he&rsquo;s like universally acknowledged</p>
<p>as the guy who inspired that character so he</p>
<p>somehow another they let him</p>
<p>capitalize on it and gives like tours and shit</p>
<p>which has got to be so</p>
<p>twisted yeah and boring</p>
<p>maybe not man</p>
<p>maybe for him it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the shit you know</p>
<p>maybe if he was a dentist he&rsquo;d be bored</p>
<p>and maybe if</p>
<p>my dentist had his job he&rsquo;d be terrified</p>
<p>maybe maybe the dentist</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mean who knows what if he me really was</p>
<p>supposed to be kramer the guys got to be very eccentric</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s really the guy who they they</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>model it after</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>what it what is that guy do now</p>

<p>photographer the other day</p>
<p>did he yeah</p>
<p>i thought he had together</p>
<p>i guess he punched him and</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>worst predicaments in the history of the media</p>
<p>for an actor</p>
<p>for an actor to have done that was one of the</p>
<p>worst predicaments</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>people have caught people with hookers like hugh</p>
<p>grant got busted with hookers and</p>
<p>you know and alec</p>
<p>baldwin yelled at his kid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all good</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that bad no</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m the world out</p>
<p>here as a nigger there&rsquo;s look we have a nigger this is</p>
<p>joe i mean i know it i know what he was trying to do</p>
<p>spoiler what he&rsquo;s trying to do spoiler</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s trying to do is say something</p>
<p>completely shocking</p>
<p>and somehow another</p>
<p>rescue himself from a bad situation</p>
<p>where he was bombing</p>
<p>and he wanted to</p>
<p>figure out how to get them how to hurt them how to shot</p>
<p>how to let them know that he didn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>you know like oh you&rsquo;re</p>

<p>look we have some niggers</p>
<p>you know and everybody was like whoa what the fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s shocking</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>shocking to me</p>
<p>is that that word</p>
<p>still works</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the few</p>
<p>words that people</p>
<p>still freak out it</p>
<p>still has magic left in it you know</p>
<p>still has that</p>
<p>ability to affect people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting it&rsquo;s amazing yeah</p>
<p>the only one left</p>
<p>other one i</p>
<p>think cunt yeah</p>
<p>dude i have a</p>
<p>whole bid on it</p>
<p>i have a whole bid</p>
<p>about the three</p>
<p>magic words love nigger and cunt</p>
<p>those are the</p>
<p>three words or</p>
<p>the three magic words that have</p>
<p>like the word love</p>
<p>always has way more</p>
<p>power than any</p>
<p>other words you can string together like i care</p>
<p>about you so much i</p>
<p>think about you all day</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it is i</p>
<p>just when i&rsquo;m around you i want to be affectionate</p>
<p>do you love me</p>
<p>you have to say it you have to say</p>
<p>i love you like i love oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fucking we&rsquo;re in we&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>house we&rsquo;re in the love house</p>
<p>we all go in and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magic word number one cunt sort of</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>used a lot yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s toss especially in england oh marks these</p>
<p>cards now so i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>is hallmark</p>
<p>using cunting cards</p>
<p>in england they cunt</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s cunt this fucking cunt</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fucking cunt this talking</p>
<p>about dudes yeah</p>
<p>yeah this fucking cunt over here</p>
<p>yeah they start they cunted</p>
<p>up so much that it&rsquo;s like this fucking dude it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying dude we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be left with two words yeah</p>
<p>but but neger</p>
<p>still very very controversial</p>
<p>you know and just even the joke in my act i</p>
<p>would say that even saying it&rsquo;s a word like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even calling anybody we&rsquo;re just saying the word</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like candyman</p>
<p>candyman candyman</p>
<p>it is like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re saying an incantation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to bring violence your way</p>
<p>like you are</p>
<p>using a bad</p>
<p>word you&rsquo;re not even calling anybody anything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just saying that this word exists and</p>
<p>in enchanting it and saying it out loud</p>
<p>you run the risk of violence</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing and it&rsquo;s two thousand and ten</p>
<p>and we think that&rsquo;s okay i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s one of the few words</p>
<p>where i can&rsquo;t even hear my own</p>
<p>voice saying it</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had the courage to</p>
<p>voice it oh it&rsquo;s just a word</p>
<p>i say it&rsquo;s all the time and you fucking them</p>
<p>yeah tell me how you do it tell me what you say fucking</p>
<p>whoa that was offensive brian</p>
<p>i thought you were</p>
<p>gonna say n word</p>
<p>fucking n word that&rsquo;s even more offensive</p>
<p>bitch she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really swear</p>
<p>funny you might be wearing a wire you</p>
<p>dirty n word but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really one so it&rsquo;s not bad you know if she was really</p>
<p>black then it</p>
<p>would feel bad but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s white oh</p>
<p>you could be</p>
<p>white you can be a</p>
<p>white nigger</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s in a song somewhere</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it is what&rsquo;s a wigger no nigger</p>
<p>brian stop saying that it&rsquo;s uncomfortable for everyone</p>
<p>we just weirded out half america</p>

<p>a hundred thousand people listening to this</p>
<p>thing listen</p>
<p>folks they&rsquo;re just words that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point it&rsquo;s a ridiculous</p>
<p>point that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been argued throughout time it shouldn&rsquo;t shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>still going on</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be it</p>
<p>should always be your intent</p>
<p>it should always</p>
<p>be like whenever you&rsquo;re in any environment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not allowed to say certain words</p>
<p>you make that environment at least 20</p>
<p>bullshit at all times</p>

<p>a correct just as a</p>
<p>correction this is not avatar</p>
<p>oh did i say avatar</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>alien pussy</p>

<p>we actually launched this two years ago</p>
<p>which is totally</p>
<p>which is how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting around</p>
<p>space so we pushed this out two years ago as just a</p>
<p>space vagina we put some girls in some blue lipstick</p>
<p>oh so this is</p>
<p>the raw avatar but it just happens that they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>super hot and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the blue</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t even make it look like a vagina</p>
<p>at all double clits i like how you did that i like it</p>
<p>double click</p>
<p>inside the mold is a</p>
<p>whole bunch of</p>
<p>different stuff</p>
<p>the mold inside is like a bunch of</p>
<p>space shells and</p>
<p>stuff and kind of grains</p>
<p>every thousand plus side has a razor blade</p>
<p>has like different ribs inside okay</p>
<p>urban myth is that an urban myth the razor</p>
<p>blade in the vagina from vietnam is that an urban myth</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never heard</p>
<p>that you never heard that</p>
<p>yeah man hookers would take these back in vietnam</p>
<p>was like when i was a kid in high</p>
<p>school you growing up in boston</p>
<p>back in vietnam i heard what they did they took</p>
<p>razor blades and they put them up the girls in china</p>
<p>then you fuck them and cut your dick in half</p>
<p>you never heard that before</p>
<p>never wow i hung out with a bad crowd</p>
<p>have you heard of the rape condoms</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard of those yeah they have little</p>
<p>spikes on them</p>
<p>what they shove it in the girl</p>
<p>the girl shoves it inside of her like a tampon</p>
<p>okay and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically like an interior lining for her vagina</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s filled with barbs</p>
<p>like fucking like with you know like fish hook</p>
<p>type deals yeah so these guys</p>
<p>they rape a lot</p>
<p>apparently in</p>
<p>africa it&rsquo;s like a serious serious problem super in</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one out of three</p>
<p>women in africa has been raped</p>
<p>certain areas of africa</p>
<p>and this is one of the areas</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re pushing</p>
<p>these rape condoms like</p>
<p>those guys are</p>
<p>gonna kill now</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>gonna be rape it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be rape and murder</p>
<p>you know if a guy</p>
<p>sticks his dick inside you and comes out bloody and</p>
<p>covered with fish hooks</p>
<p>chances are he</p>
<p>might hit you right</p>
<p>yeah even if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s raping you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna give</p>
<p>you an asshole that he would rape you</p>
<p>yeah so give you a moment</p>
<p>but a guy was such an asshole that he would rape you</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll kill you if you cut his dick up</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s a piece of shit you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna go you were right</p>
<p>you were right i shouldn&rsquo;t have raped you</p>
<p>i got fish hooks on my dick i deserve it yeah</p>
<p>yeah no he&rsquo;s gonna attack you</p>
<p>right i would assume</p>
<p>we went out i</p>
<p>was actually out there in africa kenya tanzania uganda</p>
<p>and out with some of the</p>
<p>tribesmen we</p>
<p>were working with some of the men out there to try and</p>
<p>actually instill traditional martial arts into them</p>
<p>so that they</p>
<p>could see some</p>
<p>kind of martial arts the tribesmen</p>
<p>yeah and some of the</p>
<p>inner city to</p>
<p>slum kids because really they have a</p>
<p>whole generation of fathers that are gone from aids</p>
<p>just no father figures so they have</p>
<p>nothing else to really go</p>
<p>to so they get picked up by gangs they get picked up by</p>
<p>these war parties</p>
<p>and then they get turned into little killers</p>
<p>so what we&rsquo;re trying to do is show them some kind of</p>
<p>paternal discipline</p>
<p>and show them that</p>
<p>they can be</p>
<p>strong and powerful without having to be in a gang</p>
<p>and it was a really cool program</p>
<p>and it worked but it&rsquo;s fucking intense out there man</p>
<p>really intense we</p>
<p>ended up having to stop the program because</p>
<p>civil war broke</p>
<p>out in kenya and it was just too nutty to keep doing it</p>
<p>god damn yeah</p>
<p>it was it was pretty</p>
<p>crazy so you&rsquo;re over there teaching</p>
<p>them martial arts yep</p>
<p>wow very like traditional stylized you know we</p>
<p>were going into</p>
<p>mma ground impound</p>
<p>just like discipline</p>
<p>karate type shit going</p>
<p>through the kata and</p>
<p>you know definitely</p>
<p>speaking to them and they i mean they dug</p>
<p>it you know it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that africa&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>known for martial arts</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like africa&rsquo;s the cradle of</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>humans emanated from</p>
<p>but really martial</p>
<p>arts didn&rsquo;t really pick up</p>
<p>until they got to like asia i mean there was</p>
<p>other martial arts that were developed in</p>
<p>other countries but for whatever reason</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause africa was so fucked up</p>
<p>they just went straight to weapons yeah</p>
<p>like what are we doing we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking around here with karate chops</p>
<p>give me a gun</p>
<p>you have a gun give me a pointy</p>
<p>stick man give me some shit i</p>
<p>gotta stab some</p>
<p>fucking animals with some hyenas</p>
<p>trying to eat my kids all right</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just you know</p>
<p>fucking box them</p>
<p>like in ireland</p>
<p>hey how are</p>
<p>you trying to eat me kids</p>
<p>yeah man in ireland you know what do they have to</p>
<p>worry a deer gets into your yard</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>they had time to beat the fuck out of each other</p>
<p>yeah they didn&rsquo;t even bother</p>
<p>learning mma</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even bother</p>
<p>with takedowns or leg kicks or anything like that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like ah this is good enough just use our hands</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to get</p>
<p>crazy with the knees</p>
<p>come on a flattery elbows are</p>
<p>against the rules lad why are you hitting me with that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not trying to kill each other okay</p>
<p>but in africa they&rsquo;re like fuck you they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>right for pointy</p>
<p>sticks to your</p>
<p>chest well they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>poison darts and shit well guns</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just trying to they&rsquo;re trying to jack you the</p>
<p>exception is the</p>
<p>greco roman</p>
<p>style wrestling that some of the</p>
<p>tribes have</p>
<p>really yeah like a</p>
<p>good greco in africa</p>
<p>yeah some of the</p>
<p>tribes that&rsquo;s how that&rsquo;s what determines the</p>
<p>alpha in the</p>
<p>tribe really</p>
<p>all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy rituals like do they have good technique do you</p>
<p>think you could take their back</p>
<p>yeah dude you</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t defend</p>
<p>the double like</p>
<p>no no no way</p>
<p>no way you can let him get on top</p>
<p>sweep his ass</p>
<p>yeah you know you don&rsquo;t got no base</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about the rubber</p>
<p>guard you ain&rsquo;t know you know</p>
<p>about my lockdown</p>
<p>up and down son he&rsquo;s choked out i get half</p>
<p>guard on you</p>
<p>bitch you got a problem</p>
<p>you got a deep problem make up</p>
<p>with shit in his life</p>
<p>so what kind of wrestling do they do</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s just like you know</p>
<p>like real greco roman you know</p>
<p>but is it like technical do they understand</p>
<p>under hooks and overhooks i know yeah</p>
<p>what kind of</p>
<p>throws they have throws that are like judo throws</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>when you like an all american wrestler</p>
<p>they would go there and jack them</p>
<p>jack i mean they don&rsquo;t have the nutrition and the</p>
<p>training yeah they&rsquo;re eating bugs and shit</p>
<p>then i go for you greco</p>
<p>bugs they&rsquo;re good for your wrestling</p>
<p>drinking some stuff out yeah</p>
<p>drinking goat blood and shit yeah</p>
<p>you know we were talking</p>
<p>about this in the show before but in africa</p>
<p>trap panning</p>
<p>and when you cut a hole</p>
<p>into the top of the head</p>
<p>have you ever seen that no dude some</p>
<p>tribes in africa</p>
<p>do the narnly as shit to their bodies</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve always tried to figure out what that is</p>
<p>where where</p>
<p>where where is that coming from</p>
<p>but one of them is</p>
<p>trappening trepam</p>
<p>and what it means cutting a hole through the skull</p>
<p>and like exposing the brain</p>
<p>and this one guy had done it 20</p>
<p>times antiseptic conditions no</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re doing it with coconut shells and shit</p>
<p>fucking cut your head over with a</p>
<p>sharp rock and i&rsquo;m not joking</p>
<p>they are using rocks and shit carving carving</p>
<p>no anesthetic whatsoever</p>
<p>carving in a dude&rsquo;s skulls</p>
<p>and then the women in surrey</p>
<p>who cut the hole in their lip</p>
<p>and they put</p>
<p>plates in and the bigger the plate</p>
<p>the more cows you&rsquo;re worth when you get married</p>
<p>like what is that about what is all that those are</p>
<p>tough to figure out the one scarification they</p>
<p>do a lot of that one that&rsquo;s easier to figure out but i</p>
<p>think is maybe the</p>
<p>worst is the clitorectomy</p>
<p>by the mass</p>
<p>i tribe traditional mass</p>
<p>i i mean not just them right</p>
<p>yeah yeah this</p>
<p>is more so bad yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just you know</p>
<p>and then once</p>
<p>you know once they do that like sex is just</p>
<p>never pleasurable</p>
<p>so i mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re trying to do it</p>
<p>do it because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re haters</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re haters</p>
<p>the can&rsquo;t they have no game</p>
<p>and they want to control these</p>
<p>chicks for life</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>chick turns like</p>
<p>twenty and she wise is up like dude you fucking smell</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not into this relationship</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna get some good dick</p>
<p>right and she</p>

<p>you are my property</p>
<p>and they have problems you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bunch of haters man it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>those faggots that won&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>chicks dance</p>
<p>all those dudes who</p>
<p>wanna put chicks and burkas and shit</p>
<p>come at everything but your eyes</p>
<p>you know they want them walk around like they&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>know inside of a</p>
<p>trash can looking through a slot you know</p>
<p>all totally insecure haters little faggots yeah little</p>
<p>bitch ass people living in the middle of nowhere</p>
<p>for sure it&rsquo;s the dumbest</p>
<p>place in the</p>
<p>world because it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>i always say that the middle east is</p>
<p>basically they like the townies of the world</p>
<p>because that is</p>
<p>where written language was created i mean</p>
<p>the middle east is responsible for so many</p>
<p>first you know mesopotamia babylonia</p>
<p>where iraq is is ancient sumera</p>
<p>they had the</p>
<p>first written language</p>
<p>the first agriculture</p>
<p>the first government the first</p>
<p>astrology the</p>
<p>first astronomy</p>
<p>i mean they had a lot</p>
<p>of first there was a brilliant brilliant</p>
<p>place i mean</p>
<p>so much development but</p>
<p>everybody like in all good</p>
<p>places they got</p>
<p>tired of the douchebags and they moved</p>
<p>and everybody</p>
<p>spread out civilizations</p>
<p>spread out across the country it&rsquo;s just like america</p>
<p>if you go the east</p>
<p>coast you get a lot of holdouts that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>a lot of stubborn people that go i fucking like it here</p>
<p>fuck everybody else</p>
<p>and what they really are is the</p>
<p>grandchildren and children of fucking savages</p>
<p>people in ireland and poland and england</p>
<p>that that life over there sucked so much cock</p>
<p>they were willing to get on a boat for</p>
<p>months and come to them someplace</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even know what the fuck it was</p>
<p>and so then they get there</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>huddle up and they try to figure out this new</p>
<p>place and fight off the fucking indians</p>
<p>do whatever they have to do to make a business and keep</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart goes there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be someplace</p>
<p>better than this let&rsquo;s get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>and they started</p>
<p>traveling west devote your</p>
<p>vital energy to something besides bear survival yeah so</p>
<p>that is the</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>beginning is sumair</p>
<p>and that is iraq and that is the middle east</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the middle east is so fucked</p>
<p>up that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s such haters over there you know i</p>
<p>have a theory that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think has been</p>
<p>explored very much but it seems like in the desert</p>
<p>areas of the</p>
<p>world they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>patriarchal dominated</p>
<p>and then you get to the</p>
<p>coastlands you get to the jungles they have a lot more</p>
<p>matriarchal societies that have a lot more respect for</p>
<p>women and the religions</p>
<p>appear different</p>
<p>something about that dry</p>
<p>arid landscaping of course</p>
<p>the major desert religion</p>
<p>studios and christianity</p>
<p>islam have kind of really</p>
<p>taken hold there</p>
<p>for whatever reason that kind of</p>
<p>patriarchal</p>
<p>dominance that occurs</p>
<p>out there in those it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard life right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hard life it demands</p>
<p>hard living you know</p>
<p>you have to make</p>
<p>you gotta be</p>
<p>and you also have to realize that</p>
<p>they had this</p>
<p>hard radical</p>
<p>ideology thousands</p>
<p>and thousands of years ago and a hard radical</p>
<p>ideology is very difficult to</p>
<p>break without a revolution</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t sort of evolve</p>
<p>you know if</p>
<p>their ideology</p>
<p>about like and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how recent it&rsquo;s been that they&rsquo;ve been so restrict with</p>
<p>women with the clitorectomies and with the burkes and</p>
<p>i mean how recent has that been</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still going on</p>
<p>right but i mean</p>
<p>when did it</p>
<p>start i mean</p>
<p>how what is it something that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going on for hundreds</p>
<p>of years at</p>
<p>least thousands of years the hundred</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i think but</p>
<p>when you have a situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of fear</p>
<p>and a lot of</p>
<p>religious fanaticism</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to change because everybody&rsquo;s scared</p>
<p>well even the females for the clit erectomies</p>
<p>some of them feel like they can&rsquo;t become a woman</p>
<p>until they get it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so in grain</p>
<p>so if they make it illegal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually forcing some women</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>to get them done</p>
<p>in even worse</p>
<p>conditions than</p>
<p>the flint rock and the chisel or whatever the thing is</p>
<p>to get it done so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nightmare</p>
<p>i mean you really got to attack it with education</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s the only real option</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things where i</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>levels of fear</p>
<p>when fear gets ingrained into a culture</p>
<p>and when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>control and that&rsquo;s what a lot of that is a lot of</p>
<p>this the controlling of</p>
<p>women with the</p>
<p>clothing and the dancing and you know</p>
<p>to try to prevent</p>
<p>other men from fucking them and all that craziness</p>
<p>right when that shit gets a hold of a</p>
<p>culture it&rsquo;s very hard to get it out</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying like it takes like a new restart</p>
<p>or a person sure</p>
<p>sure absolutely</p>
<p>but at least a</p>
<p>culture or a</p>
<p>person rather responsible for themselves like</p>
<p>people can wake up and go hey i&rsquo;m a douchebag i need</p>
<p>to snap out of this right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult for a</p>
<p>culture to wake up and go hey we&rsquo;re fucked up</p>
<p>look what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing overseas look we&rsquo;re pretending that this is</p>
<p>going on and we&rsquo;re making billions and</p>
<p>we got all these fucking</p>
<p>dummies that are listening to us we can do better</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare that a</p>
<p>culture wakes up or a government wakes up or any</p>
<p>large group</p>
<p>but a person can wake up</p>
<p>right you know i mean i</p>
<p>think the best</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>would be to put internet kiosks</p>
<p>fucking everywhere or</p>
<p>just put that in</p>
<p>satellite internet</p>
<p>just get them out there and have them watch</p>
<p>spice girls</p>
<p>i mean like at that</p>
<p>point you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say yeah</p>
<p>they kind of</p>
<p>do that with those</p>
<p>cheap laptops you have you seen</p>
<p>those things as like are they getting</p>
<p>into yeah like</p>
<p>throwing them in different</p>
<p>places like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the yeah but</p>
<p>they yeah they</p>
<p>definitely need some big</p>
<p>inoculation</p>
<p>of the retardation that they&rsquo;ve gone through</p>
<p>for decades and hundreds and thousands of years</p>
<p>you know they need something to get them to evolve</p>
<p>you know when if you get like people that are just so</p>
<p>wacky about a certain</p>
<p>ideology to the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so nutty</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not even allowed to draw</p>
<p>their main dude</p>
<p>oh yeah think how</p>
<p>crazy that is</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t draw</p>
<p>their main guy or they&rsquo;ll kill you</p>
<p>why do we tolerate this</p>
<p>why does anyone tolerate that</p>
<p>i mean that is</p>
<p>absolutely crazy</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not saying no one saying that muhammad</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist or</p>
<p>never did exist or he&rsquo;s not a prophet he</p>
<p>might very well be</p>
<p>i am completely uneducated to that matter</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re telling me that you can&rsquo;t draw them</p>
<p>come on that&rsquo;s silly</p>
<p>one of the tenants i had a</p>
<p>great philosophy instructor when i was</p>
<p>going to school</p>
<p>and one of the tenants that he</p>
<p>taught he was</p>
<p>philosophy of religion</p>
<p>specialist and he said</p>
<p>any god that</p>
<p>should be worship</p>
<p>should be worthy of worship</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a god and someone&rsquo;s drawing you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>smite them i mean that dude isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worthy of words well it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>followers that</p>
<p>smite right</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re smiting because they</p>
<p>feel it&rsquo;s an offense to god</p>
<p>right like if someone&rsquo;s drawing you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get pissed so does that mean that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better than god it can&rsquo;t be you can&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>system where</p>
<p>the god isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worthy of worship and being</p>
<p>as good as another man and this was</p>
<p>my thought is that all of this</p>
<p>it seems so archaic and</p>
<p>ridiculous it seems</p>
<p>so several thousand years ago</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing that this kind of ideology</p>
<p>is allowed to live</p>
<p>through this</p>
<p>age of information like deep into the 2000s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating man it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>it is i think there&rsquo;s a real grain of</p>
<p>truth at the bottom of all</p>
<p>these religions some beautiful</p>
<p>things i mean i&rsquo;m sure in the quran</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not as familiar as i</p>
<p>am with some of the</p>
<p>other works but i&rsquo;ve seen a little bit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s beautiful passages spiritual</p>
<p>spiritual and really</p>
<p>powerfully beautiful passages and all that but then</p>
<p>men get in there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to utilize that as a mechanism of</p>
<p>power to wield more power over</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>it just gets kind of</p>
<p>twisted well what&rsquo;s the origin of it all</p>
<p>i mean if it isn&rsquo;t the word of god what is it is it</p>
<p>smart people who figure some</p>
<p>things out and</p>
<p>somehow another figure out how to tell it to people</p>
<p>and those people tell it to each</p>
<p>other for thousands</p>
<p>of years and then it eventually gets written down</p>
<p>and by that</p>
<p>point it&rsquo;s become fables and the words have been</p>
<p>twisted and</p>
<p>things have gotten strange and</p>
<p>the translations are off the memories off</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re dealing with something as big as the</p>
<p>bible how many hundreds of pages is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot so</p>
<p>dudes had to</p>
<p>say it is a</p>
<p>spoken word</p>
<p>thing for like a thousand years</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>wrote it down</p>
<p>it was a while and they had a council to decide</p>
<p>you know it was like a editing council</p>
<p>where they decided</p>
<p>which now this goes in now this goes out well how</p>
<p>about the fucking</p>
<p>new testament the new testament&rsquo;s even better than that</p>
<p>there were canons for the new testament they just</p>
<p>threw out they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>fucking editor they just recently redid</p>
<p>it oh they redid</p>
<p>it yeah they have like a newer newer</p>
<p>yeah i was just talking to</p>
<p>jesus and shit and</p>
<p>we got some old notes we got some old</p>
<p>tupac tapes</p>
<p>gonna pull out</p>
<p>jesus is like tupac</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re redoing his words</p>
<p>that talking</p>
<p>snake shit yeah</p>
<p>there was like a</p>
<p>bunch of apostles that were like</p>
<p>man that dude</p>
<p>and all that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care if we know jesus</p>
<p>they chose the words that</p>
<p>you know fitted there</p>
<p>there jenna</p>
<p>yeah well that was constantine</p>
<p>that was when constantine was controlling rome he was a</p>
<p>smart dude he realized he needed to rope people</p>
<p>up with one universal religion it couldn&rsquo;t be pagan</p>
<p>well at that</p>
<p>point though the</p>
<p>slave class had really outnumbered</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>other classes so he was</p>
<p>you know he says it came to him in a</p>
<p>dream or whatever but i</p>
<p>think he was trying to survive yeah i mean</p>
<p>the christianity</p>
<p>spread in the</p>
<p>lower classes i mean</p>
<p>they idealized that</p>
<p>theory that they were</p>
<p>gonna go to heaven and all</p>
<p>these rich people</p>
<p>who were putting him to work and doing shitty</p>
<p>stuff to him</p>
<p>they were gonna go to hell so it took off</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>was like oh shit almost our entire country is slaves</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a christian like bam i had a dream</p>
<p>you know really and then that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what did it</p>
<p>he says it came to him in a</p>
<p>dream but really i</p>
<p>think it was survival so</p>
<p>the christians were just</p>
<p>taken over then they were</p>
<p>there was just too many in that</p>
<p>lower class</p>
<p>versus the patricians who were</p>
<p>well outnumbered at that</p>
<p>point that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating so it was a survival move more than</p>
<p>a control move i</p>
<p>think so at that</p>
<p>point the adoption of christianity was like he saw the</p>
<p>flood you know he saw the tides</p>
<p>going and he was</p>
<p>gonna either</p>
<p>get trampled by it</p>
<p>or he was gonna</p>
<p>you know go with it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have loved</p>
<p>to been in that war meeting yeah</p>
<p>for real well they&rsquo;re like alright well how we</p>
<p>gonna handle this yeah</p>
<p>like yo we got some shit</p>
<p>some shit is going down</p>
<p>this is people out there with</p>
<p>pitchforks and</p>
<p>fucking torches and shit yeah</p>
<p>feeding him the lions was</p>
<p>mad at that point</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s tell we</p>
<p>found jesus</p>
<p>yes i like that that&rsquo;s how we</p>
<p>found jesus go with it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m born again i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>are you born again</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m totally bored</p>
<p>again we can</p>
<p>still keep everything</p>
<p>going as usual yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah we</p>
<p>bring them in we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to include them but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna kill us yeah</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;re good we&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>again we&rsquo;re born again</p>
<p>after the races</p>
<p>history has changed oh</p>
<p>ridiculous and he didn&rsquo;t even become a christian till</p>
<p>right before he died</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>right wasn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>baptized like before he died</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>exactly the time not</p>
<p>a little bit for a long time yeah it wasn&rsquo;t a while</p>
<p>i mean you did</p>
<p>start leading like</p>
<p>dunking my fucking head in the water</p>
<p>you gotta do it you</p>
<p>gotta do it they don&rsquo;t believe you</p>
<p>unless you do it</p>
<p>yeah i gotta fucking get in the</p>
<p>water the water sucks it&rsquo;s cold yeah</p>
<p>you gotta do</p>
<p>their thing</p>
<p>you gotta get in the water</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>point he&rsquo;s posted a video</p>
<p>about him but i&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>all of his books as john shelby spawn</p>
<p>why christianity must change or die i</p>
<p>think you actually posted a youtube</p>
<p>video i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>he did yeah</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a preacher who kinda</p>
<p>is commenting</p>
<p>and very devout christian who&rsquo;s commenting on you know</p>
<p>the way christianity is gone and the</p>
<p>second book is why christianity must change or die</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really a poignant</p>
<p>book for anybody interested in yeah he was</p>
<p>super fascinating</p>
<p>he was like we&rsquo;re in the control business this</p>
<p>is all the control business</p>
<p>he was like so upfront</p>
<p>about his whole</p>
<p>you know the entire</p>
<p>career that he had in it brutally</p>
<p>honest wow his</p>
<p>first book goes through different passages and</p>
<p>basically attacks the</p>
<p>fundamentalist position of christianity</p>
<p>and says look you know this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense this was a book it was a guidebook</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of</p>
<p>stuff that doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of</p>
<p>sense in here anymore</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go through</p>
<p>this let&rsquo;s get rid of this and then his</p>
<p>second book philosophically talks</p>
<p>about how the</p>
<p>evolution of christianity needs to be</p>
<p>in order for that religion to survive</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>ultimately it will i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>like the fire and brimstone that used to be</p>
<p>that bosch paintings of people just</p>
<p>getting ripped apart</p>
<p>you go to el</p>
<p>duomo in florence you look up at the ceiling</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>demons with</p>
<p>these big giant</p>
<p>big giant wooden</p>
<p>flaming staff shoving them in people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>asses and like a</p>
<p>demon that&rsquo;s like shoving one in some girls pussy wow</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in this church beautiful church</p>

<p>crimes being punished but they</p>

<p>he was able to</p>
<p>sculpt someone&rsquo;s fingers digging into someone&rsquo;s flesh</p>
<p>like hades is</p>
<p>digging into persephone he&rsquo;s into her side like</p>
<p>grabbing the side of it</p>
<p>and you cannot believe that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>marble i mean just the way that he makes it like fleshy</p>
<p>and life like canova did the same</p>
<p>thing with this lady reclining on a pillow</p>
<p>just sculpting sheets</p>
<p>out of marvel that looked like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know you could</p>
<p>fluff them in the breeze yeah</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>just incredible and</p>
<p>all this stuff just passed on through</p>
<p>generation after</p>
<p>generation of</p>
<p>learning how to work with</p>
<p>stone and carve</p>
<p>and yeah fuck</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be duplicated yeah it&rsquo;s like people are</p>
<p>just way too lazy</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not carving shit out of</p>
<p>stone fuck all</p>
<p>the weaknesses in the marble and envisioning</p>
<p>what could come out of it but we&rsquo;ll do some</p>
<p>crazy shit like walk through the amazon</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do some</p>
<p>nice shit like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be the first guy</p>
<p>like douchebag do you know you can take a boat</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a few</p>
<p>hours you go all around well</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s even crazier than walking through</p>
<p>the amazon have you seen the documentary big riverman</p>
<p>the dude who swam</p>
<p>the amazon what he swam</p>
<p>the amazon oh like this one will be easy to</p>
<p>bring up because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big riverman com and see it</p>
<p>that dude is nuts so he&rsquo;s from like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>die yeah well he does pretty much takes 65 days right</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s his documentary this guy and he</p>
<p>started swimming because he had this alcoholic father</p>
<p>and his father</p>
<p>would come home and try</p>
<p>and beat him he&rsquo;s in eastern europe try and beat him</p>
<p>he figured out</p>
<p>he figured out if he went in the</p>
<p>river his dad</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t follow him and so he&rsquo;d just swim and his dad</p>
<p>would chase him</p>
<p>along the riverside</p>
<p>what and so eventually he</p>
<p>learned to be this stamina endurance</p>
<p>swimmer but he got all fucked in the head</p>
<p>you know and so</p>
<p>he goes out and he swam</p>
<p>all of the world&rsquo;s biggest rivers</p>
<p>and so he goes</p>
<p>out on the amazon i just saw this happen to</p>
<p>catch this late</p>
<p>night and i was just amazed and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do it like</p>
<p>a normal swimmer</p>
<p>would like take</p>
<p>their protein and do that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like getting them to</p>
<p>throw bottles of wine in the</p>
<p>water and whiskey</p>
<p>he comes off he</p>
<p>drinks another two bottles of wine</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not even in</p>
<p>shape he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kind of like chubby</p>
<p>you know and he gets there</p>
<p>but then around day 40</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s drinking the</p>
<p>water from the amazon so all the</p>
<p>parasites again</p>
<p>he has an onboard doctor and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>shocking himself with</p>
<p>electroshock therapy to kill the parasites</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>screaming with</p>
<p>stuff in his</p>
<p>head and like batteries attached to him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nutty but then</p>
<p>around the 40th day</p>
<p>the last you</p>
<p>ever hear from him in the documentary he goes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m crossing into the fourth dimension now</p>
<p>and he just fucking is gone</p>
<p>at that point just gone</p>
<p>and then so he&rsquo;ll like wake up</p>
<p>early in the morning and swim away from the boat</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where he is</p>
<p>like pointing their</p>
<p>light out and trying to find him they see him</p>
<p>naked on some</p>
<p>river bank looking at</p>
<p>driftwood just god</p>
<p>so is he gone</p>
<p>because he was just</p>
<p>fucked to begin with or was it all the parasites</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the parasites and just not taking care of himself</p>
<p>exhaustion he&rsquo;s so sunburned he has to wear this</p>
<p>like mask he looks like silence of the lambs is mask</p>
<p>covering his face holy</p>
<p>shit yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nutty</p>
<p>the big river man is the name of it martin strel</p>
<p>i believe is his name</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some naughty</p>
<p>motherfuckers it is a</p>
<p>broad spectrum of</p>
<p>human beings yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s broad yeah you know</p>
<p>just when you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ve got people</p>
<p>completely figured out you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find some new one online</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see some new shit</p>
<p>i guess when he was</p>
<p>swimming the yangtze</p>
<p>it was so dirty in some of the industrial areas</p>
<p>that he had to have</p>
<p>nightly blood</p>
<p>transfusions from a</p>
<p>nurse on the boat just</p>
<p>new blood in old blood out</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>kept swimming</p>
<p>the pictures of that swim are just insane</p>
<p>you want to swim</p>
<p>all of the biggest</p>
<p>rivers of the world okay</p>
<p>what is it about</p>
<p>people doing dangerous shit that they don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing that if you get thrown</p>
<p>into the amazon you have to figure out a way to swim</p>
<p>to stay alive and make it to the</p>
<p>shore and then get back to safety</p>
<p>i survived in the woods</p>
<p>i started a fire with rocks</p>
<p>i know how to get back</p>
<p>and i got back and i made it that&rsquo;s an excellent story</p>
<p>but when you thrust yourself into that situation</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not a game that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>river yeah well i think</p>
<p>what is that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the survival instinct that has</p>
<p>propagated the species it&rsquo;s the instinct to reproduce</p>
<p>and doing dangerous shit</p>
<p>has always gotten chicks</p>
<p>and really that&rsquo;s what it is yeah i mean</p>
<p>how do you how do you account for chicks</p>
<p>that like getting hot air balloons</p>
<p>and go across the world</p>
<p>how about this</p>
<p>chick who&rsquo;s rowing her way</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s on a sailboat</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like 16</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s sailing across the ocean</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>about is he a lesbian</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s trying to get some</p>
<p>pussy i don&rsquo;t know i mean i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s some kind of</p>
<p>you know some kind of tapping into the same</p>
<p>some of the same instincts i mean dude</p>
<p>lesbians trying to pick up straight chicks is</p>
<p>just as creepy</p>
<p>as dudes trying to pick up straight chicks</p>

<p>every once in a</p>
<p>while just reading</p>
<p>a book with actual pages you know cuz i got the ipad</p>
<p>thing and i like that too you know yeah but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sometimes comforting just to go back</p>
<p>just back shut some</p>
<p>stuff on this page</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>letters you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried this recently</p>
<p>and this is a big</p>
<p>thing that i do it&rsquo;s a sensory deprivation tank</p>
<p>you just tried it for the</p>
<p>first time right</p>
<p>and what did you</p>
<p>what did you think</p>
<p>about that well i</p>
<p>think i sent this to you in an</p>
<p>email but i likened it to the</p>
<p>first time i had sex like</p>
<p>i could tell it was something rad</p>
<p>and i knew i was</p>
<p>gonna dig it for the most</p>
<p>the rest of my life</p>
<p>but i was terrible at it like just not not</p>
<p>quite good at it yet you know you have to really just</p>
<p>relax your mind and</p>
<p>i was fidgeting with</p>
<p>how comfortable i was but then</p>
<p>i also was super tired when</p>
<p>i was in there</p>
<p>it was a long week and i didn&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>available to me except for</p>
<p>kind of late</p>
<p>in the evening and i wanted to make sure i got in</p>
<p>so i started to fall asleep but it was this</p>
<p>crazy consciousness in the</p>
<p>sleep like i saw this window</p>
<p>of where sleep was and i</p>
<p>could visually see it i</p>
<p>could see it with my eyes open</p>
<p>and i could</p>
<p>crawl in it</p>
<p>and i was asleep</p>
<p>and i could</p>
<p>crawl out of it</p>
<p>and not be asleep and i was</p>
<p>fully in control</p>
<p>of how it was</p>
<p>going and that</p>
<p>was pretty wild i mean</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re able to do with your mind in that situation</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t tell when your eyes are</p>
<p>open and your eyes are closed and there&rsquo;s no feeling</p>
<p>no sensation on your body</p>
<p>the amount of</p>
<p>control i was able to exercise was amazing</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t find any kind of</p>
<p>great lucid information out of it</p>
<p>but the experience was</p>
<p>wild i mean i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been able to see</p>
<p>those layers</p>
<p>because usually you just</p>
<p>pass out you don&rsquo;t know when you fell asleep all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>awake you remember that</p>
<p>then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re asleep and you wake up the next morning</p>
<p>but this i was able to see the steps and</p>
<p>in between and you</p>
<p>never realize how</p>
<p>quiet it is</p>
<p>until the power goes out in your house yeah</p>
<p>you know when the</p>
<p>power goes out in the neighborhood and the</p>
<p>power&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>everywhere that</p>
<p>you hear things go off</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that that dead silence that you read</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get any other way</p>
<p>well the tank is that times a million</p>
<p>the tank is that with your body it shuts</p>
<p>everything off yeah</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that i always talk</p>
<p>about i talk</p>
<p>about on this podcast all the time</p>
<p>i talk about in interviews all the time and the</p>
<p>thing that i always say is that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always shocked that people don&rsquo;t do this i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>shocked that people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>shocked that there&rsquo;s not one of these on</p>
<p>every corner</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>having these</p>
<p>things put in their</p>
<p>house they have</p>
<p>jacuzzis put in</p>
<p>their house</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you have an isolation tank</p>
<p>like do you not want to be</p>
<p>happy do you not want to</p>
<p>think do you not</p>
<p>want to relax some people are running like hell from</p>
<p>their own thoughts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too dangerous into</p>
<p>too much work man that&rsquo;s too much work it&rsquo;s more work</p>
<p>to run from your shit than it is to face your shit</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no facing your shit like facing your shit in that tank</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t hide behind any bullshit when you&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no distractions there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>you get right immediately to</p>
<p>whatever was fucking with you</p>
<p>anything and</p>
<p>then once you get good at that then you become a jedi</p>
<p>you become an astral</p>
<p>traveler you get in there and you</p>
<p>learn how to really let go just lock in quick</p>
<p>i lock in within 15 minutes i&rsquo;m gone</p>
<p>i settle in</p>
<p>it always the</p>
<p>thing is you always</p>
<p>gotta get your body to</p>
<p>relax there&rsquo;s so easy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>tension can</p>
<p>carry around in</p>
<p>you you don&rsquo;t realize how much tension you have in you</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re in a zero gravity environment</p>
<p>and you realize you&rsquo;re holding yourself yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like pulling yourself in like your</p>
<p>back and muscles are pulled in your arms are pulling</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even realize you&rsquo;re doing this you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting the</p>
<p>world all the time</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>get in there and then all that shit goes away</p>
<p>then about 15 minutes</p>
<p>in once the breathing stabilizes</p>
<p>and then i go</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;m gone then i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>off in the land</p>
<p>of wild hallucinations and fucking vivid</p>
<p>dreams and lucid</p>
<p>dreaming and flying and</p>
<p>communicating with</p>
<p>entities and</p>
<p>having things</p>
<p>explained to you in gigantic</p>
<p>three dimensional numbers from an</p>
<p>alien planet that are rotating around you and some big</p>
<p>holoscope that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a hologram that shaped like the planet</p>
<p>earth i was</p>
<p>watching the universe being explained to me</p>
<p>in letters that were from another planet</p>
<p>that were spinning around that were</p>
<p>three dimensional</p>
<p>and it was all being orchestrated</p>
<p>by these aliens and it made</p>
<p>sense to me</p>
<p>while i was</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>i was trying to figure out</p>
<p>their code and</p>
<p>their pattern</p>
<p>so this is how the</p>
<p>whole universe works</p>
<p>it all works by this one</p>
<p>thing then everything goes into another</p>
<p>thing and that</p>
<p>goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how crazy the tank is</p>
<p>yeah why is that not everywhere</p>
<p>well i mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other ways to get there too not there</p>
<p>there ain&rsquo;t no</p>
<p>other ways to get there</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing drugs</p>
<p>exactly that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>where i was leading to</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but even those are better in the tank</p>
<p>yeah you think you know what</p>
<p>mushrooms feel like</p>
<p>mushrooms in the tank are</p>
<p>a totally different animal man there&rsquo;s no distractions</p>
<p>that mushroom gets to talk</p>
<p>right to you you know</p>
<p>the weed in the tank the weeds talking</p>
<p>right to you there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>my ass is on the</p>
<p>couch and the</p>
<p>light is hitting my eyes and the</p>
<p>elbow touches the seat</p>
<p>arm there&rsquo;s none of that there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>input there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>powerful weapons</p>
<p>at our disposal that people are so scared of</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>crazy i mean the tank is one of them obviously</p>
<p>a huge resource and it&rsquo;s easy it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t complain</p>
<p>about anything but then there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>shamans for years i think</p>
<p>the best way i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard it describe is this</p>
<p>rad book called the cosmic serpent by jeremy narbie</p>
<p>and he says</p>
<p>that shaman&rsquo;s goal is to</p>
<p>lead you to the realm of the</p>
<p>spirits and then</p>
<p>allow you to defocalize</p>
<p>he talks about it like a</p>
<p>stereogram you remember</p>
<p>those 3d images</p>
<p>where you relax your eyes and</p>
<p>the 3d would pop out</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re in that kind of shamanistic</p>
<p>experience is you&rsquo;re defocalizing your body</p>
<p>and then allowing communication</p>
<p>to come through</p>
<p>but his theories are</p>
<p>pretty amazing i mean</p>
<p>these conversations are there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>right now that are listening okay</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s two groups of people</p>
<p>no obviously there&rsquo;s more than two but</p>
<p>when it comes to the subject there&rsquo;s people who&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>and people who have no fucking idea what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about like literally</p>
<p>you think we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about hippie fairy dust</p>
<p>you know like this what it sounds like you&rsquo;re wait a</p>
<p>minute what are you doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuning in to what are you</p>
<p>tuning into</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tuning in to santa claus what&rsquo;s going on right</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s even intelligent scientists</p>
<p>that will have conversations</p>
<p>and if you bring up any sort of</p>
<p>psychedelic or any sort of</p>
<p>psychedelic compound or altered states of consciousness</p>
<p>they just shot off on you</p>
<p>they just immediately discredit</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;re saying well you&rsquo;re just talking</p>
<p>about getting high and this is</p>
<p>put it in a nice little box that they can</p>
<p>discard and they toss it away</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;ve done mushrooms they&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>oh yeah exactly</p>
<p>right i get it they&rsquo;ll look at you and go yeah it</p>
<p>might be that yeah it</p>
<p>might be that i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>to like some serious serious fucking scientists man</p>
<p>and guys who have</p>
<p>phds and guys who work at universities</p>
<p>teaching schools</p>
<p>i mean teaching</p>
<p>physics courses and shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked to them</p>
<p>about psychedelics</p>
<p>and had some fascinating conversations</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>who are way</p>
<p>smarter than me way more educated than me way</p>
<p>way more experience in the ways of the</p>
<p>world and they&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>bunch of psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>and you know they&rsquo;ll tell you like</p>
<p>who knows what that is</p>
<p>yeah who the fuck knows what that</p>
<p>is well that</p>
<p>might be a billion different</p>
<p>thing this is a pretty</p>
<p>cool theory by jeremy narbie and i&rsquo;ll give you the</p>
<p>cliff notes here so for</p>
<p>discussion sake but he went down to</p>
<p>the iowa scar</p>
<p>o shamans down in the jungle and</p>
<p>had took the ayahuasca</p>
<p>with them and he was just an anthropologist</p>
<p>and for people who don&rsquo;t know let&rsquo;s explain what</p>
<p>ayahuasca is</p>
<p>ayahuasca is two different</p>
<p>plants there&rsquo;s the actual</p>
<p>dimethyltryptamine</p>
<p>active plant</p>
<p>that is part of a vine</p>
<p>and then somehow</p>
<p>out of the 80 000 species into amazon they figured out</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more than that yeah there&rsquo;s this other leaf</p>
<p>that they needed</p>
<p>to combine with it to actually make it work an</p>
<p>mao inhibitor</p>
<p>and so they combine this and they make it into</p>
<p>a tea and it&rsquo;s been part of the traditional religious</p>
<p>ceremonies down there yeah</p>
<p>see what this dmt</p>
<p>stuff is is a chemical that it&rsquo;s the most potent</p>
<p>psychedelic drug</p>
<p>known to man but it</p>
<p>exists in a</p>
<p>bunch of different plants but</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t eat it</p>
<p>because when you eat it it</p>
<p>exists in so many different</p>
<p>things i guess your body has some</p>
<p>protection for it</p>
<p>cause if you eat grass</p>
<p>grass has dmt in it well there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing that your stomach makes called monoamine</p>
<p>oxidase and that&rsquo;s m a o</p>
<p>so these guys figured out how to mix an</p>
<p>m a o inhibitor</p>
<p>that kills the</p>
<p>m a o in their system</p>
<p>with this dmt so that they can take it orally yeah</p>
<p>and you talk to</p>
<p>when they interview the guys and they</p>
<p>asked them how they figured this shit out</p>
<p>thousands of years ago by the way</p>
<p>they said the</p>
<p>plants talked to them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they say</p>
<p>about all the</p>
<p>medicines that they yeah</p>
<p>the plants told him so jeremy</p>
<p>he took that and he was like how</p>
<p>could this be</p>
<p>true he&rsquo;s like you know science discredits it but they</p>
<p>prove it time and time</p>
<p>again they pick the shit</p>
<p>that works and then</p>
<p>modern pharma goes down there and say hey</p>
<p>what does this do</p>
<p>and they know</p>
<p>the answers so how do they know the answers</p>
<p>and so the theory is that this all comes from your</p>
<p>brain your brain projects this</p>
<p>stuff when you take</p>
<p>dimethyltryptamine but he has a different theory</p>
<p>and his theory goes that</p>
<p>you know in all of</p>
<p>these cultures you see</p>
<p>a lot of serpents when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>underneath these visions</p>
<p>and these serpents are</p>
<p>often intertwined and you can see this written in rock</p>
<p>paintings in aboriginal australia and all over the</p>
<p>place the vision of the</p>
<p>serpent he calls it the cosmic serpent is everywhere</p>
<p>and what he&rsquo;s saying is that&rsquo;s actually a vision of</p>
<p>persons dna of</p>
<p>dna in general not just the persons but the dna of life</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in that</p>
<p>level you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>communicating</p>
<p>on a microbiological</p>
<p>level with dna</p>
<p>which is connects</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s kind of like the navi</p>
<p>avatar principle where</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>connected by the universal language of dna</p>
<p>and the defoculization</p>
<p>of the ayahuasca</p>
<p>allows you to communicate with the dna</p>
<p>so that the</p>
<p>plants talk to you that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s visions and wisdom from</p>
<p>everything that comes</p>
<p>and the synthesis</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s able to get</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s actually dna emits and</p>
<p>one of the ways you say they communicate is dna emits</p>
<p>actual light it emits</p>
<p>photons dna itself will do that it&rsquo;s too dim</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>small when you isolate dna by itself</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll omit a certain amount of</p>
<p>photons so all of</p>
<p>these theories that</p>
<p>your beings of</p>
<p>light and whatever and</p>
<p>everything is light</p>
<p>all sounds like you said like hippie</p>
<p>stuff or whatever but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cross culturally</p>
<p>people say this</p>
<p>well when you do dmp that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>see too you see beings that are made out of life right</p>
<p>exactly and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s the dna the dna is the substance of life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interconnected substance of life and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically the collective</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how all different life forms man you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just on drugs dude</p>
<p>i see what you&rsquo;re doing man</p>
<p>just trying to fucking this always the cynic</p>
<p>those steps in yeah that&rsquo;s good you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>this is what</p>
<p>you got you got chemicals interacting with your</p>
<p>brain and you go loopy for a few hours</p>
<p>while your body</p>
<p>tries to normalize the poison</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve put in your</p>
<p>system yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>what you are okay</p>
<p>is just another religion</p>
<p>man you&rsquo;re just believing some more wacky shit</p>
<p>and all that</p>
<p>ever tells me</p>
<p>is that dude</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t done dmt</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all it tells me</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking shit</p>
<p>about doing dmt for sure you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it</p>
<p>because once you do it you go</p>
<p>oh oh whoa whoa really really wow</p>
<p>changes the game and</p>
<p>these guys have been doing it for thousands of years</p>
<p>and people go what</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re so fucking</p>
<p>smart man how come</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have tvs or cars they don&rsquo;t have paved roads</p>
<p>cause if you were doing dmt all the time you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about tvs you know like tv ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shit compared to being able to communicate with the</p>
<p>afterlife you fuck</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny i can fish i&rsquo;ll go get a fish</p>
<p>it takes me an hour i cook i know</p>
<p>i have food i&rsquo;m done i&rsquo;ll go do some more dmt all right</p>
<p>the iowa scares they call</p>
<p>they call the</p>
<p>ayahuasca the</p>
<p>television of the forest</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what they call it like that is</p>
<p>where they go here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting</p>
<p>point better than any</p>
<p>television they brought some</p>
<p>ayahuasca back</p>
<p>from brazil i believe this was in the 50s</p>
<p>and when they</p>
<p>first recognized</p>
<p>it as a psychoactive substance</p>
<p>they were going to call it telepathine</p>
<p>because it allowed</p>
<p>groupthink and allowed telepathy like they were</p>
<p>going to patent it as telepathy</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t realize that</p>
<p>one of the active compounds in it had already been</p>
<p>identified and that was harming</p>
<p>and because harmony had already been</p>
<p>identified because of the rules of</p>
<p>scientific nomenclature like the</p>
<p>thing they were naming had already been named</p>
<p>so they couldn&rsquo;t call it telepathine</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what they were</p>
<p>gonna call it they were</p>
<p>gonna call it telepathine</p>
<p>like whoa that&rsquo;s the active ingredient</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>allows you to have telepathy</p>
<p>this is really scientists are fucking writing this down</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nutty shit man</p>
<p>it sounds so</p>
<p>woo woo deepak</p>
<p>chopra yoga beads bullshit it</p>
<p>sounds so fucking dumb</p>
<p>to me it sounds dumb</p>
<p>but i know it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how crazy</p>
<p>dmt is in ayahuasca</p>
<p>and mushrooms and all these</p>
<p>things that people just</p>
<p>automatically</p>
<p>label as silly</p>
<p>yeah automatic</p>
<p>these are life changing</p>
<p>reset button</p>
<p>pressing motherfuckers</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like oh what are you doing mushrooms man</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s an honest</p>
<p>question do you talk</p>
<p>about dmt every day</p>
<p>is there days that you don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about sure not at all</p>
<p>so amazing that like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>flooding you can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about anything</p>
<p>every day man</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>about it every day</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a moment</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>in the shower by myself</p>
<p>and you go oh yeah so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>crazy that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you were picked up by god and</p>
<p>taken a magical</p>
<p>mystery tour for</p>
<p>three hours</p>
<p>the spaceship</p>
<p>above fucking pluto</p>
<p>you would be remembering</p>
<p>that shit all the time because it was the most extreme</p>
<p>experience of</p>
<p>a human being</p>
<p>could ever possibly have but i&rsquo;ve felt that</p>
<p>in drugs where i&rsquo;m like this is the most amazing</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>whole entire</p>
<p>world but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about it it&rsquo;s not like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not this was the most amazing</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;s not like that at all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that this is even possible</p>
<p>is impossible</p>
<p>that this exists is mind blowing</p>
<p>that this reality</p>
<p>seems realer than the reality that i live in every day</p>
<p>in fact there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that feels like it&rsquo;s communicating with</p>
<p>you and it&rsquo;s giving you a message that you&rsquo;re connected</p>
<p>to everything</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a gigantic illusion created by your biology to keep you</p>
<p>alive and to make you sustain this</p>
<p>other world that</p>
<p>exists in your</p>
<p>dream consciousness</p>
<p>i mean they communicate this shit to you yeah</p>
<p>and it makes</p>
<p>sense and whatever it is</p>
<p>is sees right through you</p>
<p>and communicates only with love</p>
<p>and is showing you impossible</p>
<p>to believe images and visuals</p>
<p>and at the end of it when it&rsquo;s all over you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>changed forever</p>
<p>like you can</p>
<p>never you can&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go back you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to but you couldn&rsquo;t anyway</p>
<p>but you gotta make sure</p>
<p>that whatever you get out of that you can</p>
<p>still talk to people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too much of anything like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to lose your grip yeah you don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>slippery you get</p>
<p>slippery you</p>
<p>could get if</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a guy that i know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tattoo artist that&rsquo;s done dmt like a hundred times</p>
<p>and i have hung out with this dude and</p>
<p>he did eddie&rsquo;s arm</p>
<p>you know eddie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sleeve yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to say his name because just in case he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want people knowing</p>
<p>anyway dude</p>
<p>is got this fucking sniper stare</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got this look in his eyes man like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just been over there just a few too many times</p>
<p>like he can&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>quite step back into the real world</p>
<p>like every corner he turns around there&rsquo;s fucking dmt</p>
<p>elves staring at him</p>
<p>from behind the counter</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s just been there too many times man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had some very interesting</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>i think when you when you</p>
<p>when he does talk</p>
<p>about it but he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go into</p>
<p>depth like me like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just yapping</p>
<p>about because i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it in years it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still fresh in my mind</p>
<p>it start like off like i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about it a lot and then you</p>
<p>start peeing your</p>
<p>pants and then you start</p>
<p>seeing it when you talk</p>
<p>about it you</p>
<p>start seeing it again</p>
<p>you know like little</p>
<p>flashbacks will pop in your head of</p>
<p>things that happened</p>
<p>not flashbacks like</p>
<p>you were like you can&rsquo;t see or you&rsquo;re hallucinating</p>
<p>but just like</p>
<p>oh yeah oh okay that happened oh yeah oh yeah</p>
<p>just it makes you think</p>
<p>about it again</p>
<p>there was one</p>
<p>experience that i had at the traditional shaman out</p>
<p>in the desert here in the us and</p>
<p>she took me out she took me out</p>
<p>a girl shaman yeah female shaman it&rsquo;s hardcore right</p>
<p>and so this is</p>
<p>where the music start yeah</p>
<p>so but anyways i</p>
<p>you know i fasted did the proper</p>
<p>traditional</p>
<p>preparation</p>
<p>and i drank you know</p>
<p>drank a substance i</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>you know some kind of mushroom and</p>
<p>other traditional</p>
<p>plant based substance</p>
<p>and that what i got from that has totally</p>
<p>changed my life forever</p>
<p>at that point i was able to lift from my body</p>
<p>lift from it</p>
<p>look down and realize</p>
<p>oh wow this is just a</p>
<p>vessel you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful it&rsquo;s wonderful it</p>
<p>allows me to flow through this world but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the end of it&rsquo;s not the be all</p>
<p>you know like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>separation there&rsquo;s a distinction</p>
<p>between body and spirit</p>
<p>and from then</p>
<p>the fear of</p>
<p>death evaporated for me and it&rsquo;s just it</p>
<p>would just be a</p>
<p>shame like i certainly don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna die i love life life is fucking rat but</p>
<p>the fear of</p>
<p>it is gone there was just a hallucination man you were</p>
<p>on mushrooms you&rsquo;re hanging out with a hot shaman girl</p>
<p>trying to get some</p>
<p>pussy got a little</p>
<p>carried up in the moment you went a little</p>
<p>barry manilow</p>
<p>jesus just put him on your</p>
<p>shoulders man</p>
<p>he could have been</p>
<p>on the shoulders</p>
<p>everything of that</p>
<p>do you ever</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>the book of the book the sacred mushroom in the</p>
<p>cross you ever</p>
<p>heard that story</p>
<p>i heard a little bit</p>
<p>about it john</p>
<p>marco allegro who was</p>
<p>one of the head scholars of the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls he was in charge of deciphering it spent</p>
<p>14 years working on the oldest version of the</p>
<p>bible by far</p>
<p>and what he</p>
<p>decided after 14 years he</p>
<p>wrote a book</p>
<p>about it that the entire christian religion</p>
<p>was a gigantic misunderstanding and what it was</p>
<p>initially all about was</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms</p>
<p>and fertility rituals</p>
<p>and he said this is what the</p>
<p>whole christian religion was</p>
<p>initially all about</p>
<p>and like you know</p>
<p>has this fucking book</p>
<p>dedicated to it i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t follow it i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand you</p>
<p>know ancient languages i have no knowledge of it but</p>
<p>just the fact that this guy was like this really</p>
<p>well respected scholar and he</p>
<p>came to these</p>
<p>conclusions i mean</p>
<p>of course they were doing drugs</p>
<p>the drugs were around</p>
<p>mushrooms have</p>
<p>been around for thousands and thousands of years</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>first ones to figure out you can eat it</p>
<p>people back then ate</p>
<p>everything they could</p>
<p>right they ate</p>
<p>everything they had to try</p>
<p>the reason why we know shit&rsquo;s poisonous</p>
<p>is because dudes</p>
<p>ate it and died and they said all</p>
<p>right he ate that he died don&rsquo;t eat that</p>
<p>you eat that you try eating that because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of this shit around if this is edible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s good the</p>
<p>apples are good let&rsquo;s eat the apples</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they figured out how to do</p>
<p>things they ate</p>
<p>everything bro they</p>
<p>ate it all they knew what was good and what was bad</p>
<p>and if mushrooms are around and they were</p>
<p>people were eating them</p>
<p>and if people were eating them</p>
<p>they were seeing god</p>
<p>and if they were seeing god</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want anybody</p>
<p>else in on the action so what did they do they hid all</p>
<p>their fucking knowledge</p>
<p>about these mushrooms</p>
<p>and these rituals and they put it in stories</p>
<p>and they put it in fables and parables</p>
<p>and they just</p>
<p>twisted it all up so it was just a little bit different</p>
<p>yeah fascinating</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the fucking the forbidden</p>
<p>fruit is a mushroom man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an ancient fresco in france</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this ancient</p>
<p>painting rather</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>on this wall it&rsquo;s from fucking thousands of years ago</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s adam and eve</p>
<p>with a mushroom tree</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s adam and eve with mushroom caps all around them</p>
<p>i mean it is the fucking forbidden fruit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>squashed because if you take that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>direct link</p>
<p>i feel to god you know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>both a spiritual</p>
<p>person and a kind of a deistic believer in</p>
<p>in the universal god force but</p>
<p>you take away</p>
<p>mushrooms and then you insert people and people get to</p>
<p>absolve you of your sins it gives them</p>
<p>power you build them</p>
<p>giant structures</p>
<p>they get to have wield</p>
<p>money power</p>
<p>and if you look at the history of the catholic church</p>
<p>women as well</p>
<p>especially in the middle ages in the renaissance</p>
<p>going through there</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;ve inserted themselves and then removed the</p>
<p>other mechanism</p>
<p>to get there directly</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ve become the intermediaries</p>
<p>at a certain</p>
<p>point i wonder i mean how much</p>
<p>of that is true because there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>where they lost the way and what it was really all</p>
<p>about i wonder how much they let the common people know</p>
<p>about it even back then</p>
<p>you know maybe it was something that you know the</p>
<p>elite found out</p>
<p>about it and they</p>
<p>tried to protect</p>
<p>the information even from the common folk</p>
<p>but it also</p>
<p>might have been a question of climate change too</p>
<p>terrence mckennis</p>
<p>had some ideas</p>
<p>about that and he thought that</p>
<p>with global climate change</p>
<p>which is very</p>
<p>cyclical happens all the time</p>
<p>a lot of times</p>
<p>the climate</p>
<p>will be inhospitable for mushrooms it changes</p>
<p>so instead of getting</p>
<p>mushrooms all the time now they can&rsquo;t get them anymore</p>
<p>and so then the culture</p>
<p>completely changes</p>
<p>and becomes more of an alcohol</p>
<p>based culture</p>
<p>it starts off they start</p>
<p>using preserved</p>
<p>mushrooms in</p>
<p>honey because we know they&rsquo;ve been preserving</p>
<p>things in honey for thousands and thousands of years</p>
<p>and then you deal with fermentation because</p>
<p>honey can become a psychoactive substance</p>
<p>on its own it can become mead</p>
<p>when it becomes fermented it becomes like an alcohol</p>
<p>and so then they go into an alcohol culture</p>
<p>and then before you know it the mushroom ideas are gone</p>
<p>all the love and you</p>
<p>know all the your fellow man that shits out the window</p>
<p>and now you know everyone&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>drunk and raping</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s interesting it&rsquo;s fascinating shit man</p>
<p>you always gotta wonder like how</p>
<p>did we get to be who we are now like what was it like</p>
<p>could you imagine if you</p>
<p>could go to like</p>
<p>1400 bc and</p>
<p>just go hang around england and see what the fuck was</p>
<p>going on in france</p>
<p>and see how people were living in europe you know how</p>
<p>trippy would that be man that&rsquo;d be great whoa</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>the strangest</p>
<p>fucking thing</p>
<p>to be able to</p>
<p>go back in time even just in like an invisible</p>
<p>impenetrable</p>
<p>capsule like you</p>
<p>could just just</p>
<p>stand there like in an invisible</p>
<p>phone booth in</p>
<p>the middle of a town</p>
<p>you know and you get to</p>
<p>watch and they can&rsquo;t walk through the</p>
<p>phone booth it looks like a tree they can&rsquo;t touch it</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always been fascinated by that moment before battle</p>
<p>you know where you know you just have you have like an</p>
<p>axe or you choose between an</p>
<p>axe a morning star and a sword</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like what am i</p>
<p>gonna use it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>maybe make me survive you</p>
<p>know like how good is my armor</p>
<p>not as good as that dude&rsquo;s but i&rsquo;m a rocket anyways</p>
<p>and like just</p>
<p>feel that you know i mean</p>
<p>mma gets an approximation of that and</p>
<p>i think why people love it so much</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s the closest we got</p>
<p>but it pales in</p>
<p>comparison to that</p>
<p>you know to that</p>
<p>moment you&rsquo;re with all of the people in your country</p>
<p>and perhaps the</p>
<p>horde that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>is gonna rape your girl</p>
<p>you know kill your children put them into slavery</p>
<p>smash their head on</p>
<p>rocks and you got it you just</p>
<p>gotta fucking hold the ground</p>
<p>you know like how</p>
<p>is that you know i mean we don&rsquo;t even know what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about we have no idea no</p>
<p>and they did that forever</p>
<p>forever i mean that was such a part of the</p>
<p>human you know</p>
<p>birthright but how much of that shit is</p>
<p>still in our genes and how do you shut that shit off</p>
<p>all of it yeah</p>
<p>right the human hardware</p>
<p>is so retro it</p>
<p>still goes on though like any war you&rsquo;re doing the same</p>
<p>thing like what kind of missiles</p>
<p>does this guy have of</p>
<p>course it goes on</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>different in person it</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s so impersonal</p>
<p>you know with the</p>
<p>call of duty it&rsquo;s pretty cool</p>
<p>i mean yeah</p>
<p>soldiers are ryan</p>
<p>just said right</p>
<p>seen call of duty</p>
<p>while two wars are</p>
<p>going on overseas well that means like</p>
<p>call of duty that means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all ground game the game is pretty much ground game</p>
<p>is that like</p>
<p>going into war</p>
<p>explosions and</p>
<p>stuff like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still going on for that is</p>
<p>going on you know what else is</p>
<p>going on drones</p>
<p>drones are allowed to go into</p>
<p>places we&rsquo;re not even really at war with</p>
<p>like in pakistan</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not really supposed to be at war in pakistan</p>
<p>but we got spaceships</p>
<p>that are working on remote control from nevada</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re remote controlling them from nevada</p>
<p>and jacking dudes</p>
<p>in pakistan</p>
<p>from the air they probably have iphone apps with</p>
<p>controlling control</p>
<p>just tilt it</p>
<p>man you can tilt it destroy that person by just hitting</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>movie do you remember that</p>
<p>movie where</p>
<p>the dude got really good at that</p>
<p>video game and then the</p>
<p>aliens came and recruited him</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah remember that shit i did</p>
<p>remember that shit star something starfighter</p>
<p>starfighter was that it</p>
<p>starfighter</p>
<p>i just remember because his name was rogan</p>
<p>his name was alex rogan</p>
<p>you know dude i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing that with kids that get really good at</p>
<p>video games fan</p>
<p>kids get real good at video games</p>
<p>you guys are awesome the army has</p>
<p>score and then</p>
<p>people burst in your why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you son</p>
<p>do i not take</p>
<p>that about this the army has a video game that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>track so they can</p>
<p>track the top guys i bet</p>
<p>those top guys get knocks on the door once in a while</p>
<p>would you like a million dollars</p>
<p>could you imagine and you weigh like 80</p>
<p>pounds and you&rsquo;re in your</p>
<p>underwear you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like killing</p>
<p>things for real i just like to play your game</p>
<p>right can i go back to playing your</p>
<p>game you put some poor little thirteen year old like</p>
<p>five more years you can join us</p>
<p>you can play that game for a living what do you</p>
<p>think pal what do you think</p>
<p>get you all the hookers want</p>
<p>take some poor</p>
<p>fucking kid was just awesome at the army game</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s scary to remove that personal side to killing</p>
<p>you know i mean it&rsquo;s just a totally different paradigm</p>
<p>well we were talking before the show</p>
<p>about these</p>
<p>guys that have been caught in</p>
<p>afghanistan that are us soldiers that have been killing</p>
<p>civilians and taking home little trophies</p>
<p>playing like a game</p>
<p>just jacking people and killing people just</p>
<p>they get too used to killing people man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too used to killing people</p>
<p>and too used to being in a</p>
<p>place where everyone</p>
<p>resents you and they don&rsquo;t want you to be there</p>
<p>yeah and you know i always</p>
<p>for the longest time</p>
<p>i always would look at</p>
<p>politicians and go how much</p>
<p>say do they really have how much</p>
<p>say does the president really have and what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on over there</p>
<p>or is he just a dude with a job just like all of us</p>
<p>is it just all bullshit once you get in there</p>
<p>and i used to look at bush</p>
<p>and when bush was in iraq and i used</p>
<p>to say is this</p>
<p>motherfucker responsible</p>
<p>for all these people</p>
<p>dying is he responsible for all this</p>
<p>talk about weapons and mass destruction</p>
<p>or is he just some dude who&rsquo;s got to do this job</p>
<p>and i remember when he was</p>
<p>standing in</p>
<p>front of those people and that dude took off his</p>
<p>shoes and threw him at him</p>
<p>yeah remember that shit</p>
<p>i remember that and he ducked and then the dude</p>
<p>threw it again and he ducked</p>
<p>again and he had a little half</p>
<p>smile on his face</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like that guy&rsquo;s just a spokesman</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what i got out</p>
<p>of that i looked at that i&rsquo;m like that is just a dude</p>
<p>with a very difficult job</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not all that bright and has some</p>
<p>ideals and got</p>
<p>stuck in this situation and</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s got to say we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to war but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>machine behind that</p>
<p>motherfucker he&rsquo;s not running shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking at him ducking those</p>
<p>shoes smiling</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like that guy&rsquo;s not he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a care in the world</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not worrying</p>
<p>about what happened in iraq he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s just an employee</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s not his responsibility really is it</p>
<p>who knows who knows</p>
<p>i think alex</p>
<p>jones would have a theory on that</p>
<p>that was my favorite part of the</p>
<p>whole bush administration was that dude</p>
<p>threw his shoes</p>
<p>it was the first time i liked him</p>
<p>the first time i liked bush i would get</p>
<p>angry i&rsquo;m like this</p>
<p>motherfucker just making up words all this bullshit</p>
<p>then i thought</p>
<p>about him like that guy probably gets like four hours</p>
<p>sleep at night</p>
<p>what would i be saying if i was</p>
<p>speaking all</p>
<p>these people i&rsquo;d be making up words too</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be stumbling i</p>
<p>would fuck my words up at everybody fucks up</p>
<p>you know obama</p>
<p>said something</p>
<p>about there being</p>
<p>forty eight</p>
<p>states mean he fucked up the</p>
<p>states when he was running</p>
<p>you know people fuck</p>
<p>things up all the time you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tired all the time you&rsquo;re on this campaign trailer</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s not running shit</p>
<p>learned i like bush</p>
<p>no i mean i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s probably all right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not a bad guy</p>
<p>yeah everybody&rsquo;s like use the team and he&rsquo;s a devil</p>
<p>i bet they believe that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really a president</p>
<p>until they get in there you know</p>
<p>i think once you get in there</p>
<p>they open up</p>
<p>these doors</p>
<p>and you get to see the gears of the universe run</p>
<p>you get to see the gears of our</p>
<p>whole system and</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>well if we stop the war we don&rsquo;t have the oil and</p>
<p>society is going to fall apart and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting to a</p>
<p>point of overpopulation that&rsquo;s why we need</p>
<p>feed me camps and we have to make sure</p>
<p>that if something goes down we have enough caskets and</p>
<p>whoa now about you cutting</p>
<p>taxes oh fuck all that</p>
<p>yeah fuck all that fuck all that exactly we need some</p>
<p>money dude we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need some</p>
<p>money got some shit</p>
<p>going on we got to come up with an alternative fuel</p>
<p>we have exactly two years</p>
<p>worth of fuel left</p>

<p>i think he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>ailmented yeah</p>
<p>you get in it&rsquo;s just like what the fuck you know</p>
<p>lobbyists and fucking congress and this and that and</p>
<p>layers and red tape and</p>
<p>chaos and war and then they just tell heroin</p>
<p>heroin heroin</p>
<p>heroin coming in by the fucking boatload</p>
<p>wait wait what&rsquo;s everyone doing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just slavely afghanist</p>
<p>need to make a profit</p>
<p>other would support this war</p>
<p>you know we were talking</p>
<p>about that on the alex</p>
<p>jones show and we were talking</p>
<p>about that before the show that</p>
<p>there was a heralda</p>
<p>rivera it was in afghanistan talking to this</p>
<p>fucking soldier this guy who has a family</p>
<p>who is supposed to be defending his country</p>
<p>and meanwhile</p>
<p>where is he</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>poppy fields</p>
<p>protecting the</p>
<p>poppy fields for the afghani</p>
<p>farmers cause in</p>
<p>order for the afghani</p>
<p>farmers to support</p>
<p>the fact that we&rsquo;re over in afghanistan</p>
<p>dropping bombs on your moms</p>
<p>we have to get this guy&rsquo;s approval</p>
<p>and we have to</p>
<p>allow them to keep</p>
<p>producing their illegal crop of heroin</p>
<p>so we have american soldiers</p>
<p>that are guarding</p>
<p>afghanistan heroin</p>
<p>so that we can go over there</p>
<p>and blow shit up</p>
<p>whoa god damn</p>
<p>what do you do if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>obama what do you do</p>
<p>fuck you get in how you</p>
<p>gonna fix that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tough you know but is you know i</p>
<p>think they figured out that his approval ratings were</p>
<p>dropping is the economy was</p>
<p>was tightening</p>
<p>up and so they&rsquo;re like i fuck it let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you know push some more</p>
<p>money on the</p>
<p>system push the ball up and then it&rsquo;s working you know</p>
<p>if i thought</p>
<p>that heroin</p>
<p>was helping the economy i say sell that heroin</p>
<p>who the fuck is buying heroin</p>
<p>retards you</p>
<p>know why is oil</p>
<p>still like at</p>
<p>least in california in most</p>
<p>states right now</p>
<p>still cheap</p>
<p>cheaper than it was like five years ago</p>
<p>you know you mean</p>
<p>when bush was leaving office then they had a fucking</p>
<p>a grab but don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>right now it</p>
<p>should be like</p>
<p>ridiculously high</p>
<p>especially after like that</p>
<p>spill and stuff like that</p>
<p>well did you just realize or just here rather they</p>
<p>underestimated iraqis</p>
<p>oil reserve by 25</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 25 more oil in iraq than they thought there was</p>
<p>oh shit party</p>
<p>on oh shit gonna get that club</p>
<p>hat son fuck a v8</p>
<p>you know listen man</p>
<p>who the fuck knows</p>
<p>i think it was i</p>
<p>think they just jacked up all the</p>
<p>prices so they can pay for new plasmas</p>
<p>on top of the</p>
<p>all the fucking oil</p>
<p>you could be</p>
<p>gone to like</p>
<p>the gas station there&rsquo;s like nice plasma tvs</p>
<p>and everything like that and like</p>
<p>where does this come from</p>
<p>oh yeah 5 a gallon</p>
<p>last year you know</p>
<p>i wonder who actually how that works i</p>
<p>think i think actually how it works is</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re all in bed together obviously</p>
<p>but i believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the distributors</p>
<p>that set the</p>
<p>price and then</p>
<p>these oil companies like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>place up a street it&rsquo;s owned by</p>
<p>these hindus</p>
<p>that i go to</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>the ohm on the door</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like this is the oddest</p>
<p>place ever they sell weed pipes there</p>
<p>they sell weed pipes and incense at the counter</p>
<p>like this is the oddest</p>
<p>place ever like you guys sell</p>
<p>petrochemicals you sell</p>
<p>you know the real problem the reason why we&rsquo;re in war</p>
<p>that you know that the reason why we pollute</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all coming out of this hole right here</p>
<p>anyway you get the ohm at the door</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s them setting the price</p>
<p>the plasmas i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the companies that sell it to them</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>free market</p>
<p>speculation handles a lot of that i mean when oil</p>
<p>price was dropping there</p>
<p>was big deflationary pressures at the same time gold</p>
<p>prices were</p>
<p>dropping things were</p>
<p>price because nobody had any</p>
<p>money the speculators</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t able to buy the gold</p>
<p>they were pulling</p>
<p>their assets back out into cash etc but now</p>
<p>things are a little bit looser</p>
<p>and these commodities have</p>
<p>value they&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>inflation now because</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s push it</p>
<p>you know just shoving</p>
<p>money into the system</p>
<p>right so in an</p>
<p>inflationary</p>
<p>you know time</p>
<p>then these commodities have</p>
<p>value so now we&rsquo;re seeing oil rising we&rsquo;re seeing gold</p>
<p>right but what was the</p>
<p>big there was one big jump</p>
<p>where it went up to like five</p>
<p>bucks a gallon</p>
<p>what was the</p>
<p>cause of that</p>
<p>you know i think at that</p>
<p>point it was a massive</p>
<p>inflationary concern</p>
<p>you know that there was just</p>
<p>that money was</p>
<p>going to lose its</p>
<p>value and that</p>
<p>caused the oil to go up in price</p>
<p>yeah when it goes up</p>
<p>a barrel does anybody know you don&rsquo;t know either do you</p>
<p>brian has no idea</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ninjas ninjas at the price</p>
<p>in japan on friendly dolphins i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain supply and demand factors</p>
<p>involved in the oil but</p>
<p>as well specifically but on a macro</p>
<p>level i mean it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>generally inflation it just</p>
<p>seemed very</p>
<p>suspicious to</p>
<p>me that it was the end of the bush administration</p>
<p>administration that was</p>
<p>clearly under the</p>
<p>influence of big oil</p>
<p>and then at the very end of the administration</p>
<p>everything just gets jacked up</p>
<p>it was to pay his tab you know</p>
<p>it was dreadline they were</p>
<p>going to redline as much</p>
<p>money out of the</p>
<p>system as they could</p>
<p>until the new administration came into play</p>
<p>you know how much control does</p>
<p>the president</p>
<p>or the administration really have on how that kind of</p>
<p>stuff works do they have any</p>
<p>is it all it&rsquo;s all got to be set up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna let some new dude come in</p>
<p>every four years and just rerun shit like why</p>
<p>would we do that</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>career guys the very top of the heap they&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>we got this we got</p>
<p>you know well opec</p>
<p>supposedly sets how much available</p>
<p>reserves there are and kind of does that but how</p>
<p>much is it you know all of that is some speculation you</p>
<p>know who knows how much they know</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re doing but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting game with a lot of</p>
<p>money at stake when you have that much</p>
<p>money at stake you</p>
<p>could be fucking sure</p>
<p>that people are trying to figure out a way to fuck it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty amazing what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done though because if it wasn&rsquo;t for oil there</p>
<p>would be no</p>
<p>plastic there&rsquo;d be no computers there&rsquo;d be no nothing</p>
<p>you know all the shit that we make today no</p>
<p>flashlights</p>
<p>no flashlights</p>
<p>no flashlights this</p>
<p>is actually</p>
<p>flashlight is actually made out of oil yeah</p>
<p>this shit has to come out of the ground as oil</p>
<p>before you can fuck it yeah mostly mineral oil food</p>
<p>grade mineral</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s not made out of heaven</p>
<p>joe primary component</p>
<p>and food grade mineral oil comes out of the ground</p>
<p>right just like just like oil</p>
<p>well where does</p>
<p>it come from yeah</p>
<p>it actually</p>
<p>might does it come from minerals</p>
<p>i should probably know that doesn&rsquo;t come from fish</p>
<p>can you make a flashlight out of fish oil the beaten</p>
<p>that would be more realistic</p>
<p>dirty fucking yeasty flashlight</p>
<p>maybe some dudes just miss stinky</p>
<p>pussy the only time they got laid is by sluts and just</p>
<p>drunk pigs didn&rsquo;t watch their snatch</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>give me a hat on i got a smell</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a product that came out actually called vulva</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;ve done they sell it for 40</p>
<p>bucks gang already</p>
<p>for 40 bucks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a little perfume vial that supposedly</p>
<p>smells like pussy no really</p>
<p>yes it does</p>
<p>so you know obviously being in the business</p>
<p>and we ordered some</p>
<p>and we passed it around to smell</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite get there but what it kind of smells like is like</p>
<p>cat box like no no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>close it&rsquo;s way closer than that it&rsquo;s like post condom</p>
<p>sweaty sex oh</p>
<p>sweat and rubber has that and</p>
<p>like this like this</p>
<p>oh why would anybody want to sell</p>
<p>stinky pussy smell</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know we used to sent ours with</p>
<p>with like the nice</p>
<p>spread on your vanilla</p>
<p>scent but now all</p>
<p>flashlights</p>
<p>come on i always wonder how much of like fart porn</p>
<p>is just for show</p>
<p>how much of dudes oh</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s mostly</p>
<p>definitely for show girls are farting in dudes</p>
<p>mouths and they&rsquo;re beating off and shit</p>
<p>what is that is that for show or is that just dudes</p>
<p>were far porn really over the deep end what is that</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>you know i think with all</p>
<p>these fetishes</p>
<p>someone out there likes it</p>
<p>for sure at</p>
<p>least somebody for</p>
<p>at least one guy out</p>
<p>there loves</p>
<p>everything you know</p>
<p>what i think it is i</p>
<p>think all of</p>
<p>these fetishes whether</p>
<p>their feet or whether it&rsquo;s shit i</p>
<p>think someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mommy was like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disgusting don&rsquo;t you ever fart like</p>
<p>and they just hammer him with this repression</p>
<p>and this repression gets all twisted up</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden all they</p>
<p>want to do to get a boner is fart on somebody</p>
<p>you know because they&rsquo;ve been told by</p>
<p>their mother so many times farting is disgusting</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever fart</p>
<p>and i think the same with feet like hide your</p>
<p>dirty feet your</p>
<p>dirty feet they</p>
<p>they stink blah</p>
<p>blah blah and like really like kind of victorian</p>
<p>you know parents are doing that all the</p>
<p>sudden all they wanted to do is see someone getting</p>
<p>jerked off by a girl&rsquo;s feet so what&rsquo;s your fetish wow</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t have one really what&rsquo;s yours bro hot</p>
<p>girls i don&rsquo;t know my beautiful</p>
<p>girlfriend yeah</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s yours brian</p>
<p>i have a lot of fetishes</p>
<p>really yeah totally</p>
<p>like what definitely</p>
<p>boobs but that&rsquo;s not a fetish</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called being a dude</p>
<p>every guy&rsquo;s in its</p>
<p>boobs i&rsquo;m not really no you don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about them at</p>
<p>all i&rsquo;m really a butt guy</p>
<p>yeah i mean i</p>
<p>appreciate butt is</p>
<p>definitely more important i</p>
<p>appreciate i</p>
<p>appreciate what they do to the feminine</p>
<p>form like i can aesthetically</p>
<p>value them but as a</p>
<p>sexual object</p>
<p>very low on the left</p>
<p>yeah i agree</p>
<p>that well i don&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re low on the list</p>
<p>but they do not</p>
<p>compare to the ass</p>
<p>yes is critical</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>because a girl can have a</p>
<p>tremendous ass and really be like an a</p>
<p>cop and she&rsquo;s hot as fuck</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>you look at that ass like god damn</p>
<p>but a girl with big</p>
<p>tits and a really flat ass is just like</p>
<p>if the butt had</p>
<p>nipples i would agree</p>
<p>if an ass had nipples i</p>
<p>would agree</p>
<p>could you imagine though if an ass had</p>
<p>nipples if an ass</p>
<p>had nipples you</p>
<p>would agree</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want a flat one</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying for fetuses if you combine boob and ass</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>the best trying to do a mashup yeah on a massive</p>
<p>fetish fetish mashup the remix</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>they just have this</p>
<p>dense thick heel skin that curls over on each side</p>
<p>like a human flip flop</p>
<p>you could hide a q tip from</p>
<p>where the ankles</p>
<p>the calves go into the</p>
<p>ankles you can</p>
<p>just tuck one in there and not even see it</p>
<p>we were talking about that too that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that you least have sympathy for</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s overweight</p>
<p>you know i i sympathize with people who have granular</p>
<p>problems you know but</p>
<p>if you just a fat fuck just gluttonizing all day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a fuck a fact shit</p>
<p>say that again have you ever fucked a fat chick</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give you a</p>
<p>second chance</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;m sure i have</p>
<p>sure i blocked it out you know</p>
<p>it actually is a little bit like hey it&rsquo;s more chick</p>
<p>and it actually you know you</p>
<p>get sweaty and greasy it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re fucking more</p>
<p>woman and i kind of</p>
<p>enjoyed it was different</p>
<p>do you feel more comfortable with your body too</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re like listen</p>
<p>bitch you know you&rsquo;re fat</p>
<p>you know i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of it that way</p>
<p>it was kind of like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s skin and</p>
<p>boobs everywhere</p>
<p>everywhere do</p>
<p>you ever feel uncomfortable</p>
<p>about any one of</p>
<p>these folds in her stomach</p>
<p>right it was just</p>
<p>weird like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to do it</p>
<p>again but it was</p>
<p>definitely interesting who was it the</p>
<p>toast that only fucks with a</p>
<p>shirt on was it ari</p>
<p>duncan i don&rsquo;t remember whatever point is</p>
<p>i guess if you were if you were banging i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s alright i think i think i&rsquo;m incorrect</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re banging</p>
<p>it might have been louis ck</p>
<p>oh i can see that</p>
<p>no well i think he actually has a bit on it actually</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>yeah i think louis has a bit on it um</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re fucking a fat</p>
<p>chick like you could like loosen up you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re banging like some super hot</p>
<p>alpha female with perfect</p>
<p>shape like why is she even let me fuck her this is</p>
<p>ridiculous right like i&rsquo;m not even worthy</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s a faculty like bitch you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as good as you can make it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny yeah there&rsquo;s definitely i mean in</p>
<p>culturally you know there&rsquo;s some cultures that still</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of dudes who like em fat like em</p>
<p>i have a friend who likes</p>
<p>thick girls and he always jokes about sam tripoli</p>
<p>he jokes about it he likes em thick</p>
<p>he likes em thick he goes i like a thick girl</p>
<p>just like say it out loud i like em big</p>
<p>i like a big ass</p>
<p>you know and he&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s what he likes man that&rsquo;s his type of</p>
<p>woman always has been</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not faking it that&rsquo;s what he likes</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s got their own thing</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>a weird thing like when someone&rsquo;s got a little little</p>
<p>twist yeah a little twist and what they&rsquo;re attracted to</p>
<p>go with a fucking like a long foot</p>
<p>and i want a big foot</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want a wide foot but i like a girl with a long</p>
<p>foot i have friends who</p>
<p>will look at a girl&rsquo;s feet almost first</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>oh no no look at</p>
<p>her she&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>like a size 10 you know they&rsquo;ll just be out</p>
<p>oh what i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>so the big feet</p>
<p>big feet big</p>
<p>feet are bad or like weird toes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like that with weak chins and weak eyebrows</p>
<p>if a girl&rsquo;s a weak chin</p>
<p>or a weak eyebrow really</p>
<p>small chins are disturbing yeah disturbing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with you genetically</p>
<p>right like if you&rsquo;re really missing a chance because</p>
<p>it reminds me of</p>
<p>like a frog or something it&rsquo;s odd</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an oddity like why is your</p>
<p>lower jaw so small</p>
<p>like do you not have to chew</p>
<p>things yeah</p>
<p>right are you more</p>
<p>evolved than</p>
<p>me are you in the next</p>
<p>stage where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be eating liquid</p>
<p>fruit can you blow that out</p>
<p>and do a bubble and make a nice song from your mouth</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>is that evolution</p>
<p>are they more</p>
<p>evolved than us</p>
<p>know but what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>and also eyebrows</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about you eyebrows</p>
<p>eyebrows bug me when</p>
<p>chicks have like</p>
<p>really like</p>
<p>drawn on eyebrows or</p>
<p>like just you know no eyebrow at all it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>bugs you bugs the</p>
<p>fuck why do</p>
<p>chicks trim</p>
<p>their eyebrows we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>if a girl has big bushy eyebrows we don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they just got it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make her less</p>
<p>hot take care</p>
<p>of all in the middle</p>
<p>yeah but but</p>
<p>yeah girls with</p>
<p>unibrow but you know what if a girl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hot and she&rsquo;s got a unibrow who gives a fuck</p>

<p>on you but she falls in love and you&rsquo;re banging her you</p>
<p>got i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think any brown</p>
<p>would bother me at all man</p>
<p>hairy legs are a</p>
<p>trip what about</p>
<p>facial hair</p>
<p>i dated a girl when i was really young</p>
<p>who was um she was</p>
<p>going to an all girls</p>
<p>school she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to an all girls college and her and her friends</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t shave their legs</p>
<p>yeah they were like</p>
<p>super feminist</p>
<p>hippie chicks</p>
<p>and this just</p>
<p>did not work out the conversations that we had were</p>
<p>it was like they they went to this</p>
<p>completely all girl</p>
<p>school that was like</p>
<p>super like you know</p>
<p>super ultra</p>
<p>liberal ultra</p>
<p>socialist ideals and</p>
<p>the view of the</p>
<p>world was very strange and</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t shave</p>
<p>why should women have to shave men and shave</p>
<p>like how about</p>
<p>we both shave</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll fucking shave</p>
<p>you okay if</p>
<p>the only way to get you shave is that i have to shave</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll fucking shave</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mind having shaved legs i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird but i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do it if you&rsquo;ll do it i can&rsquo;t fuck you hobbit lady</p>
<p>you got hair</p>
<p>on your feet you know that&rsquo;s just a trip man yeah</p>
<p>girls don&rsquo;t be having hair on your feet</p>
<p>please stop that but that&rsquo;s been i mean</p>
<p>this female</p>
<p>shaving has been</p>
<p>going on for thousands of</p>
<p>right but what is the reason for that is there an</p>
<p>evolutionary reason why are we so much</p>
<p>more attracted</p>
<p>to less hair and why is hair</p>
<p>disgusting to us</p>
<p>is it a hygiene</p>
<p>thing for pussy</p>
<p>right it must be a hygiene</p>
<p>thing right</p>
<p>like you got all that</p>
<p>crazy hair i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what</p>
<p>the fuck is in there</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s clean</p>
<p>or visual creatures too so it right</p>
<p>you but some guys like hairy pussies</p>
<p>the hairy pussies on</p>
<p>their comeback</p>
<p>i mean harry</p>
<p>pussies very two</p>
<p>thousand ten</p>
<p>sasha gray and some of</p>
<p>these girls and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rocking it they got the bush but they cut it off</p>
<p>right at the top you</p>
<p>know i mean they don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>all the way through to the</p>
<p>so they let a top bush but they don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>the butt hair</p>
<p>butthole bush go yeah</p>
<p>so what do they do they wax around all that wax</p>
<p>their laser and</p>
<p>lasers just keep a landing</p>
<p>patch or tweezer</p>
<p>no but it&rsquo;s not on any kind</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like a real triangle</p>
<p>is that like a defiance</p>
<p>thing like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna redefine</p>
<p>my sexuality</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s just that people get</p>
<p>so accustomed to one</p>
<p>thing that the</p>
<p>new is hot probably it&rsquo;ll go in ten years</p>
<p>sasha grey fascinates me</p>
<p>and one of the reason</p>
<p>why she fascinates me is because she&rsquo;s like the girl</p>
<p>that like somehow or another is</p>
<p>free of the porn</p>
<p>more into more like of mainstream</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s you know people&rsquo;s thoughts you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s not just thought of she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like elevated</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like left the just a total porn</p>
<p>world and she&rsquo;s permeated regular pop culture</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s strange when</p>
<p>something like that happens like how does one do that</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that are like super</p>
<p>successful at something like</p>
<p>lance armstrong boom</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s the guy he&rsquo;s the guy rides the bike</p>
<p>yeah you know and jenna</p>
<p>jameson there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>super porn star you know she&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>and then it was a few</p>
<p>that get through the</p>
<p>tracy lords that get through and then</p>
<p>other people know about him</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>sasha gray is one</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a unique one she is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because she&rsquo;s on the very hardcore</p>
<p>side of the business too yeah she&rsquo;s no holds barred i</p>
<p>mean whatever whatever she&rsquo;s down with</p>
<p>but she kind of does it in a way</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i want to explore</p>
<p>all the sides</p>
<p>of sexuality including the dark side so she</p>
<p>kinda has owned it</p>
<p>from the beginning</p>
<p>yeah i think that&rsquo;s made it better you don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>sasha a poor</p>
<p>sasha you&rsquo;re like sasha</p>
<p>is doing what</p>
<p>she wants to do and she&rsquo;s doing it on camera so</p>
<p>i think has</p>
<p>helped her out a lot and then you know she got a big</p>
<p>break with that</p>
<p>steven sawderberg&rsquo;s film</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>that did you see that as</p>
<p>it was a little tough to</p>
<p>watch the whole</p>
<p>thing but it was cool if i</p>
<p>would like yeah</p>
<p>i would like as a</p>
<p>short movie</p>
<p>you know like she reluctant to say it sucks</p>
<p>i do well i</p>
<p>know i know sasha i</p>
<p>know sasha i</p>
<p>know some of</p>
<p>these girls well</p>
<p>she was an awesome</p>
<p>actor but look what you had to work with</p>
<p>well it was a cool feeling</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t drag that on for an hour</p>
<p>and a half as well what&rsquo;s the cool feeling what is the</p>
<p>movie about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of this very dark kind of artistic</p>
<p>analysis of a call girl</p>
<p>you know and how that interaction is</p>
<p>but it could have been done with one scene</p>
<p>like you get it you get the</p>
<p>scene you get the feeling you get how</p>
<p>this interaction goes so in the girlfriend</p>
<p>experience is she providing like an intimate call girl</p>
<p>experience that it&rsquo;s like having a</p>
<p>girlfriend yeah</p>
<p>yeah exactly</p>
<p>i saw like two minutes of it once on</p>
<p>television about</p>
<p>right really</p>
<p>maybe i saw the two minutes i saw was the last two</p>
<p>like talking</p>
<p>this guy and hugging him and then they cut the</p>
<p>black and yeah</p>
<p>what the fuck is that</p>
<p>just just kind</p>
<p>of a snippet that lasts a little bit too long</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fucking strange</p>
<p>thing man you ever have a</p>
<p>buddy that&rsquo;s in love with a prostitute</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had guys fall in love with the stripper like the</p>
<p>t pain song</p>
<p>i had a friend who was in love with the prostitute</p>
<p>he was a guy used to play pool with</p>
<p>yeah very nice guy</p>
<p>but he was unfortunate looking</p>
<p>and he did not do very well with the</p>
<p>ladies and he</p>
<p>would go to this massage</p>
<p>power and get jerked off by this one prostitute</p>
<p>and it was like one of those</p>
<p>creepy massage ballers</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t really a massage baller</p>
<p>like you know they like rub you back and</p>
<p>then just go what&rsquo;s up put your dick out let&rsquo;s do this</p>
<p>and he wanted to ask her out to</p>
<p>dinner outside and she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go out with them</p>
<p>and he was trying to figure out like he&rsquo;s asking me</p>
<p>what i should do what the magic</p>
<p>words were what</p>
<p>should i do to get her to come out with me i really</p>
<p>would like to see her outside of the club yeah</p>
<p>and i was like oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on your own</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many know</p>
<p>where the wrong</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>translate that there&rsquo;s so many things</p>
<p>wrong with what you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>i mean yeah okay well</p>
<p>how okay what happens then you become boyfriend and</p>
<p>girlfriend and she agrees looks and</p>
<p>no more in the</p>
<p>mouth only hand jobs</p>
<p>from now on</p>
<p>like do you guys do you come to an</p>
<p>agreement or</p>
<p>just accept the fact that this is what she does at work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s work for her</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tough</p>
<p>strange right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s strange that we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so genetically attached</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so genetically attached to controlling each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s sexuality</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could have a wife that was a massage therapist</p>
<p>and she could be us</p>
<p>goods great deep</p>
<p>tissues let her let her rub you bob</p>
<p>oh really your wife&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna rub me</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna rub me with oil</p>
<p>all over my back and am i</p>
<p>gonna grown</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s rubbing me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go oh yeah</p>
<p>oh so good and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be cool with that yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay because it&rsquo;s just rubbing your back</p>
<p>but if she rubs your dick</p>
<p>and you make those same</p>
<p>noises i mean</p>
<p>basically she&rsquo;s doing the same thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just massaging you but it just feels way better</p>
<p>but feels too good</p>
<p>too much too much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>psychologically attached to her rubbing on your dick</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>we draw the line</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a funny it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny paradigm</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly always been one sided i mean</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t even want a</p>
<p>chick who does massages</p>
<p>yeah i would feel</p>
<p>creeped out</p>
<p>get a bunch of my</p>
<p>buddies come over and you massage i&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>yeah could you imagine if you had a</p>
<p>chick that was doing massages and you really into her</p>
<p>and then one of your buddies</p>
<p>started getting massages from her</p>
<p>okay bro what the fuck</p>
<p>what are you doing</p>
<p>and they have a nice</p>
<p>like eight ladies</p>
<p>i give massage hug</p>
<p>when they see</p>
<p>thank you so much for the big tip</p>
<p>please you&rsquo;re the best</p>
<p>stop it i&rsquo;m not the best you&rsquo;re the best you kill me</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t wait for the next one</p>
<p>when&rsquo;s our next one when&rsquo;s our next one we doing this</p>
<p>again yeah oh stop</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like hey</p>
<p>are you guys fucking like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on over here</p>
<p>god damn it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re causing pleasure with your hands</p>
<p>and the rubbing his ass</p>
<p>cheeks what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>you have those</p>
<p>those conversations like</p>
<p>would you tell me if mark got a hard on</p>
<p>while you massage them what are you saying</p>
<p>stop it god</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a real distinction for me</p>
<p>i mean and then some people who won&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>their girls get a massage</p>
<p>i have yeah for sure</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t let him get a massage from another male</p>
<p>masseuse you</p>
<p>know and that&rsquo;s some taliban type shit</p>
<p>but you know and then</p>
<p>it just is a</p>
<p>whole variety of</p>
<p>different levels of what people are comfortable with</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well i can see that</p>
<p>no dudes fucking seeing you</p>
<p>naked and rubbing your</p>
<p>right but yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna look at your pussy</p>
<p>yeah for sure</p>
<p>for sure i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting paradigm i mean for me</p>
<p>i think i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we have a you</p>
<p>know me and my girl have a very like very open honest</p>
<p>you know relationship and she</p>
<p>the music don&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>she respect</p>
<p>we respect each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s ability to just</p>
<p>you know want to go out and</p>
<p>experience things but this segment of</p>
<p>chris marcus&rsquo;s pen pan</p>
<p>is brought to you</p>
<p>by the flashlight</p>
<p>please continue</p>
<p>but there would be</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real hard line between like</p>
<p>that like i</p>
<p>could you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m totally cool with her getting massaged</p>
<p>and even in like some perfect circumstance</p>
<p>where there was some eunuch</p>
<p>you know who needed to manually</p>
<p>get her off at some</p>
<p>point i think i</p>
<p>would be cool with that but at the point</p>
<p>well you know whatever they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist in you&rsquo;ll be cool with but they do they castrati</p>
<p>still exist they</p>
<p>chop their balls off they get</p>
<p>some situation</p>
<p>where it was very</p>
<p>mechanical she goes in for a service</p>
<p>he mechanically get</p>
<p>right but at the</p>
<p>point where it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s lusting</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s lusting there that&rsquo;s when the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the</p>
<p>board that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the fucking hard line is</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>boom boom forget</p>
<p>about it no lust</p>
<p>just physical</p>
<p>no lust physically</p>
<p>for me i can make the</p>
<p>connection it&rsquo;s the same as</p>
<p>rubbing the back</p>
<p>or doing something like that</p>
<p>is the same</p>
<p>as you go into the jerk off</p>
<p>salon right</p>
<p>yes go there just</p>
<p>some girl just rubs your balls</p>
<p>with hot oil</p>
<p>and jerks you off and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>nothing is going on just kind of feels really</p>
<p>mechanical ah</p>
<p>thank you that was</p>
<p>great that was awesome i got rid of that not mike</p>
<p>go out and talk</p>
<p>about your childhood</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know my dad oh my god i don&rsquo;t know my dad either right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right next you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>holding hands laying in the</p>
<p>field looking up with the stars</p>
<p>fuck all that man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just bullshit</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s no good boom</p>
<p>boom boom boom</p>
<p>the real question is</p>
<p>gonna be what happens</p>
<p>when we can create artificial people and fuck them</p>
<p>and our people even</p>
<p>gonna bother with relationships</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real question</p>
<p>you are on the brink of this with this</p>
<p>flashlight thing</p>
<p>cause now you guys are the</p>
<p>first people</p>
<p>that have created an effective artificial vagina</p>
<p>all those other ones are bullshit all those</p>
<p>blow up dolls</p>
<p>those are for bachelor</p>
<p>party gag gift bags all</p>
<p>right those are</p>
<p>silly nobody really fucks blow up dolls</p>
<p>if you do it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good you&rsquo;re better off jerking off you</p>
<p>might fuck one once</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not good yeah</p>
<p>you guys have</p>
<p>engineered a true artificial vagina</p>
<p>but this is just step one</p>
<p>remember when tvs</p>
<p>when you go over your grandfather&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and the tv was this big</p>
<p>giant ass fucking cabinet</p>
<p>and the tv itself was only like 11 inches across</p>
<p>and you need this fucking</p>
<p>monstrous piece of</p>
<p>furniture with</p>
<p>big tubes and</p>
<p>shit the bag of wires</p>
<p>and remember it</p>
<p>would sometimes sparks</p>
<p>would come out the back and you&rsquo;d have to open up that</p>
<p>there was like a particle</p>
<p>board back to it and you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>unscrew it and pull it</p>
<p>back and look inside the bowels of this fucking beast</p>
<p>now look at it you can</p>
<p>watch your little iphone it</p>
<p>slips in your pocket man</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s way higher resolution so much better</p>
<p>much better</p>
<p>experience watching a</p>
<p>movie on your iphone</p>
<p>than it is one of those</p>
<p>stupid tvs or an ipad</p>
<p>jesus christ yeah</p>
<p>the ipad of the fake pussies coming</p>
<p>hopefully hopefully</p>
<p>flashlight will be the ones to do it do you</p>
<p>think so are you guys working with genetic engineers</p>
<p>are you on the cusp of nanotechnology</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>i mean all of that that&rsquo;s kind of the golden</p>
<p>goose like the more realistic you can get it</p>
<p>interactive and</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>fully people have</p>
<p>tried to do it but</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>it well yet so obviously we&rsquo;re looking into it i mean</p>
<p>things have to evolve i mean the</p>
<p>fleshline are</p>
<p>you looking into robotics</p>
<p>yeah well to have one</p>
<p>one eye on robotics</p>
<p>hmm just said it</p>
<p>just leave it</p>
<p>yeah i mean i don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>too much into it but we&rsquo;ve certainly</p>
<p>explored all</p>
<p>those different</p>
<p>things even making it</p>
<p>so that they</p>
<p>could register</p>
<p>your performance so you</p>
<p>could almost</p>
<p>you know log in and see</p>
<p>how your performances compared</p>
<p>to somebody</p>
<p>else like in</p>
<p>courts you know</p>
<p>like what is</p>
<p>how do you register</p>
<p>like you have</p>
<p>high scores like high</p>
<p>score you are devaluing the personal experience</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking it too far man</p>
<p>two thousand</p>
<p>stroke shouldn&rsquo;t be like three</p>
<p>this is a you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fucking a person who you&rsquo;re trying to make feel good</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>shoot a load</p>
<p>i know if i</p>
<p>do this ten times</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like why is it taking so long</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>should have you</p>
<p>should have like</p>
<p>flashlight pants for gay guys</p>
<p>that like the there&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>thing like the end of the</p>
<p>flashlight so</p>
<p>it goes on their assholes</p>
<p>when other guys fuck and</p>
<p>the other guy it feels better</p>
<p>you know like it feels like a pussy</p>
<p>adapter for another guy&rsquo;s asshole</p>
<p>how do you know that they don&rsquo;t like the</p>
<p>feeling of guys assholes i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>mix it up a little bit they only have one tight listen</p>
<p>dude is fucking</p>
<p>you in the buddies fucking you in the butt all</p>
<p>right this is</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have a filter for that</p>
<p>something rather disturbing is</p>
<p>that actually happened except</p>
<p>the guy just put</p>
<p>the flashlight straight in his butt</p>
<p>oh really yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t see that but our</p>
<p>flesh jack team informed me</p>
<p>okay there was a</p>
<p>video was this</p>
<p>was a video the</p>
<p>video guys stuff the</p>
<p>flashlight up his but another guy fucked the flashlight</p>
<p>would that make</p>
<p>would that make you gay</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that yes</p>
<p>dude if you do fish in the butt it&rsquo;s gay</p>
<p>listen if you</p>
<p>yeah but i&rsquo;m saying if a guy fucks you</p>
<p>your flashlight</p>
<p>okay see if you stuff a</p>
<p>flashlight up your ass</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s gay</p>
<p>if the guy fucks your</p>
<p>flashlight is he gay because he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>touching is he gay</p>
<p>is that what you&rsquo;re saying he&rsquo;s just fucking a rubber</p>
<p>vagina it&rsquo;s gay</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somehow</p>
<p>touching a guy getting off okay what if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch him what if you just</p>
<p>assume like a high</p>
<p>mount if the guy</p>
<p>spread your legs</p>
<p>apart he keeps</p>
<p>his legs closed do you</p>
<p>want me to say</p>
<p>no for a reason shut up</p>
<p>is he gay what is it queer</p>
<p>is that queer</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>weird you know one</p>
<p>of our most popular selling units is called the stamina</p>
<p>training unit though</p>
<p>and really explain this</p>
<p>well the concept is</p>
<p>basically that</p>
<p>your hand doesn&rsquo;t feel anything like</p>
<p>pussy so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t prepare you to have sex</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a lot of anxiety</p>
<p>performance anxiety people who don&rsquo;t last long enough</p>
<p>want to last longer</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve been able to give them</p>
<p>a product that&rsquo;s very like highly sensitive in a canal</p>
<p>so they can</p>
<p>use it and get a little bit more prepared and</p>
<p>sensitized and people love it</p>
<p>like we get feedback like man</p>
<p>thank you so much you know like i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>had problems with this but now i&rsquo;ve gotten a lot better</p>
<p>yeah the first time you actually</p>
<p>stick your dick inside a vagina no</p>
<p>yeah i remember the</p>
<p>first time i had sex i came in one second</p>
<p>i came in one</p>
<p>second i stuck it</p>
<p>i pulled it out and there was just loads</p>
<p>everywhere oh my god</p>
<p>i barely made it</p>
<p>barely made</p>
<p>it i have no idea what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna feel like the</p>
<p>first time i blew a load i was in shock</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know that you know you i wasn&rsquo;t nobody told me shit</p>
<p>all right no my parents didn&rsquo;t tell me anything</p>
<p>and when i was</p>
<p>i guess i was like fourteen or fifteen</p>
<p>fifteen my girlfriend blew me and i</p>
<p>busted one in her mouth</p>
<p>and my ears rang</p>
<p>and i was like what the hell was that</p>
<p>like i couldn&rsquo;t believe that like</p>
<p>stuff comes out of you</p>
<p>like you could feel it come out of you like whoa</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>building up to</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know that there was even an orgasm</p>
<p>thing i recall it being like a 30 second</p>
<p>orgasm though</p>
<p>the first one oh yeah</p>
<p>creta lasted a</p>
<p>ridiculous amount</p>
<p>my fucking ears rang</p>
<p>the first time i came</p>
<p>my ears rang they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t rang since</p>
<p>wow cause i</p>
<p>never gave myself a day off</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve given myself like one day off since</p>
<p>no i did one time for my website no</p>
<p>it was like 30 days or something like that i</p>
<p>tried to do</p>
<p>but yeah you</p>
<p>never recapture</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they say with heroin annex the</p>
<p>first time they</p>
<p>shoot heroin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just insanely beautiful</p>
<p>experience and from then on you&rsquo;re chasing the dragon</p>
<p>dragon yeah you know that expression</p>
<p>yeah what is that the</p>
<p>first load you blow it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>as good as it gets kids</p>
<p>love it enjoy it</p>
<p>but the experience is so rough</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>i mean you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just nervous i remember man i remember the</p>
<p>first time i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to use this condom</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>into the bathroom and i&rsquo;m just like it&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>right she&rsquo;s in the bed and she&rsquo;s ready</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>literally like was hot</p>
<p>and i just came out and just gave up i was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry we got to come up with a different paradigm</p>
<p>to make this happen</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>and eventually you figure it out and work but that</p>
<p>first time is fucking</p>
<p>brutal top top</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about these</p>
<p>fighters that hold off for</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re crazy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re distracting the shit out of themselves</p>
<p>yeah that seems like a really bad idea that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>silly i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s no no</p>
<p>writing no no tests no studies done ever that show</p>
<p>a decrease in performance</p>
<p>due to the fact that you&rsquo;re having sex</p>
<p>i think the distraction that you</p>
<p>would get from not having sex would be</p>
<p>way more problematic yeah and that</p>
<p>would fuck you up more</p>
<p>would fuck up your</p>
<p>train of thought you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>fight you want to get some pussy god</p>
<p>fucking late</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve only gotten late in</p>
<p>eight weeks when</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>training camp that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy but i mean it seemed</p>
<p>they seem to say that it</p>
<p>builds aggression</p>
<p>you know that they just want to fucking conquer</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it does but you know</p>
<p>just how much</p>
<p>aggression do you need man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fucking professional cage</p>
<p>fighter already</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re aggressive</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>need to be more fucked up</p>
<p>i wonder if</p>
<p>they have better ground game though because they always</p>
<p>want to get on the ground i&rsquo;ll tell you who used to</p>
<p>fight and who used to fuck</p>
<p>right before he</p>
<p>fight tyson</p>
<p>that should be the end</p>
<p>discussion yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t abstain</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t abstain from</p>
<p>sexual intercourse this</p>
<p>is a natural feeling for me i just had to make sure</p>
<p>make sure i was</p>
<p>relaxed before my big</p>
<p>fights those old</p>
<p>tyson training</p>
<p>videos are beautiful the best was his early</p>
<p>fights man like marvis frazier</p>
<p>you ever watched the marvis frazier</p>
<p>fight that was assault</p>
<p>he just ran</p>
<p>up to that regular dude and beat the fuck out of his</p>
<p>super alpha body</p>
<p>that shit didn&rsquo;t even make any sense</p>
<p>he came out of nowhere and got everybody</p>
<p>excited about</p>
<p>fighting again</p>
<p>for the longest time</p>
<p>after muhammad</p>
<p>ali nobody give a fuck</p>
<p>about boxing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>larry holmes era everybody&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>larry holmes is</p>
<p>fighting pinklin</p>
<p>thomas who gives a fuck</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know if they ever fought but</p>
<p>you know my</p>
<p>point is like</p>
<p>you know who</p>
<p>gives a shit oh tony tubbs who gives a shit</p>
<p>yeah michael doakes whatever you know</p>
<p>that all sudden this</p>
<p>crazy motherfucker</p>
<p>moving a hundred times faster than everybody else</p>
<p>and just smashing people in the face at will</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we wanted to see we didn&rsquo;t want to see that</p>
<p>those fights were like</p>
<p>those fights</p>
<p>yeah you want to see assaults yeah two minutes</p>
<p>here it was worth it</p>
<p>not really though people get pissed off</p>
<p>sometimes you have a</p>
<p>bunch of friends over for pay per view</p>
<p>because nobody gives a fuck</p>
<p>about the prelims in boxing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the beautiful things</p>
<p>about the ufc</p>
<p>yeah you get a ufc card</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just getting the main event</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>a fuckload of other</p>
<p>fights and they&rsquo;re all well</p>
<p>matched and they&rsquo;re all people you give a shit</p>
<p>about they&rsquo;re all they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>exciting fights</p>
<p>especially the ones that actually make the air</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of shit to</p>
<p>watch so if the end</p>
<p>fight is only like 15 seconds</p>
<p>you know like anderson silva</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>james irvin or something like</p>
<p>bam it&rsquo;s over you don&rsquo;t feel ripped off you feel like</p>
<p>well we saw a lot of shit before we saw that you know</p>
<p>those tyson fights man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d have friends</p>
<p>say me i didn&rsquo;t buy it the last one was 30 fucking</p>
<p>seconds sure</p>
<p>yeah man but that&rsquo;s kind of how</p>
<p>it was an epic moment the one i missed was the one</p>
<p>where you lost</p>
<p>i saw because i was like yeah</p>
<p>who fucking he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna beat the shit out of this guy</p>
<p>busting like buster douglas was like</p>
<p>sixty to one</p>
<p>underdog or something</p>
<p>crazy crazy what was the</p>
<p>he was something nutty</p>
<p>right wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>thirty one or something yeah</p>
<p>you got that and then i remember i</p>
<p>watched it i</p>
<p>watched the tape</p>
<p>and i was convinced</p>
<p>while i was</p>
<p>watching the tape that he was gonna win</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like tyson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna win this</p>
<p>i was like i know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna win i know he got</p>

<p>and i was like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna win this i know he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>win there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>big fucking joke</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense man he can&rsquo;t be losing</p>
<p>tyson doesn&rsquo;t lose</p>

<p>when you&rsquo;re a kid to realize that there are</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>that everyone&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s a few people that just pass that</p>

<p>to be married to out on dates</p>
<p>having to go to a kenny fucking g concert</p>

<p>watching sports and having fun</p>
<p>no no no no no no no you&rsquo;re at a kenny g concert</p>

<p>so you know</p>
<p>people kind of overlook a lot of</p>
<p>very legal and very cool substances that</p>
<p>are available</p>
<p>and so i brought you guys some</p>
<p>blue lotus oil</p>
<p>now as you know lotus</p>
<p>lotus oil was</p>
<p>historically</p>
<p>prized from</p>
<p>the land of the lotus eaters kind of gives you this</p>
<p>euphoric poppy</p>
<p>feeling and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it exists</p>
<p>in a lot of</p>
<p>hindu artwork right</p>
<p>the lotus flower so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>you know quite it takes like a</p>
<p>ton of lotus oil to make this one little vial here this</p>
<p>might be loud as</p>
<p>i undo it so</p>
<p>well what is it</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a little vial here</p>
<p>let me open this up here don&rsquo;t they extract</p>
<p>like out of thousands and thousands and thousands</p>
<p>of loads it&rsquo;s a ton</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an actual</p>
<p>ton of pedals to make 2</p>
<p>000 pedals 2</p>
<p>000 yes make that little vial</p>
<p>to make a little</p>
<p>vat and then they seem</p>
<p>like a little vat</p>
<p>so then they make this vial how</p>
<p>large is to oh he</p>
<p>dropped it yeah</p>
<p>how large this is</p>
<p>two thousand</p>
<p>look at this folks</p>
<p>so large is two thousand</p>
<p>petals it must be immense</p>
<p>well two thousand</p>
<p>pounds yeah i mean i mean two thousand</p>
<p>pounds unbelievable</p>
<p>so it makes it makes</p>
<p>like an ounce of the oil</p>
<p>what does it look like in a room like there&rsquo;s so light</p>
<p>there are 2 000</p>
<p>petals fucking ton</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very</p>
