    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman.</p>
<p>Dr. Jack Feldman is a distinguished professor</p>
<p>of neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>He is known for his pioneering work</p>
<p>on the neuroscience of breathing.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with breathing</p>
<p>and how essential breathing is to life.</p>
<p>We require oxygen,</p>
<p>and it is only by breathing that we can bring oxygen</p>
<p>to all the cells of our brain and body.</p>
<p>However, as the work from Dr. Feldman and colleagues</p>
<p>tells us, breathing is also fundamental</p>
<p>to organ health and function</p>
<p>at an enormous number of other levels.</p>
<p>In fact, how we breathe, including how often we breathe,</p>
<p>the depth of our breathing,</p>
<p>and the ratio of inhales to exhales</p>
<p>actually predicts how focused we are,</p>
<p>how easily we get into sleep,</p>
<p>how easily we can exit from sleep.</p>
<p>Dr. Feldman gets credit for the discovery</p>
<p>of the two major brain centers</p>
<p>that control the different patterns of breathing.</p>
<p>Today, you&rsquo;ll learn about those brain centers</p>
<p>and the patterns of breathing they control,</p>
<p>and how those different patterns of breathing</p>
<p>influence all aspects of your mental and physical life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s especially wonderful about Dr. Feldman and his work</p>
<p>is that it not only points to the critical role</p>
<p>of respiration in disease, in health, and in daily life,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also a practitioner.</p>
<p>He understands how to leverage particular aspects</p>
<p>of the breathing process in order to bias the brain</p>
<p>to be in particular states that can benefit us all.</p>
<p>Whether or not you are a person</p>
<p>who already practices breath work,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who simply breathes to stay alive,</p>
<p>by the end of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to understand a tremendous amount</p>
<p>about how the breathing system works</p>
<p>and how you can leverage that breathing system</p>
<p>toward particular goals in your life.</p>
<p>Dr. Feldman shares with us</p>
<p>his own particular breathing protocols that he uses,</p>
<p>and he suggests different avenues for exploring respiration</p>
<p>in ways that can allow you, for instance,</p>
<p>to be more focused for work,</p>
<p>to disengage from work and high stress endeavors,</p>
<p>to calm down quickly.</p>
<p>And indeed, he explains not only how to do that,</p>
<p>but all the underlying science</p>
<p>in ways that will allow you to customize</p>
<p>your own protocols for your needs.</p>
<p>All the guests that we bring on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>are considered at the very top of their fields.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s guest, Dr. Feldman,</p>
<p>is not only at the top of his field, he founded the field.</p>
<p>Prior to his coming into neuroscience</p>
<p>from the field of physics,</p>
<p>there really wasn&rsquo;t much information</p>
<p>about how the brain controls breathing.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of information,</p>
<p>but we can really credit Dr. Feldman and his laboratory</p>
<p>for identifying the particular brain areas</p>
<p>that control different patterns of breathing</p>
<p>and how that information can be leveraged</p>
<p>towards health, high performance,</p>
<p>and for combating disease.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p>from the top researcher in this field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really wonderful and special opportunity</p>
<p>to be able to share his knowledge with you.</p>
<p>And I know that you&rsquo;re not only going to enjoy it,</p>
<p>but you are going to learn a tremendous amount.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine.</p>
<p>Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase, they&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>

<p>One quick mention before we dive into the conversation</p>
<p>with Dr. Feldman.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we discuss a lot of breathwork practices,</p>
<p>and by the end of the episode,</p>
<p>all of those will be accessible to you.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m aware that there are a number of people</p>
<p>out there that want to go even further</p>
<p>into the science and practical tools of breathwork,</p>
<p>and for that reason, I want to mention a resource to you.</p>
<p>There is a cost associated with this resource,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a terrific platform</p>
<p>for learning about breathwork practices</p>
<p>and for building a number of different routines</p>
<p>that you can do or that you could teach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Our Breathwork Collective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not associated with the Breathwork Collective,</p>
<p>but Dr. Feldman is an advisor to the group,</p>
<p>and they offer daily live guided breathing sessions</p>
<p>and an on-demand library</p>
<p>that you can practice anytime, free workshops on breathwork,</p>
<p>and these are really developed by experts in the field,</p>
<p>including Dr. Feldman.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned, I&rsquo;m not on their advisory board,</p>
<p>but I do know them and their work,</p>
<p>and it is of the utmost quality.</p>
<p>So anyone wanting to learn or teach breathwork</p>
<p>could really benefit from this course, I believe.</p>

<p>And now for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here, Andrew.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re my go-to source for all things respiration.</p>
<p>I mean, I breathe on my own,</p>
<p>but when I want to understand how I breathe</p>
<p>and how the brain and breathing interact,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the person I call.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll do my best.</p>
<p>As you know, there&rsquo;s a lot that we don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>which still keeps me employed and engaged,</p>
<p>but we do know a lot.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we start off by just talking about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s involved in generating breath?</p>
<p>And if you would,</p>
<p>could you comment on some of the mechanisms</p>
<p>for rhythmic breathing versus non-rhythmic breathing?</p>
<p>Okay, so on the mechanical side,</p>
<p>which is obvious to everyone,</p>
<p>we want to have air flow in, inhale,</p>
<p>and we need to have air flow out.</p>
<p>And the reason we need to do this</p>
<p>is because for body metabolism, we need oxygen.</p>
<p>And when oxygen is utilized</p>
<p>through the aerobic metabolic process,</p>
<p>we produce carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>And so we have to get rid of the carbon dioxide</p>
<p>that we produce,</p>
<p>in particular because the carbon dioxide</p>
<p>affects the acid-base balance of the blood, the pH.</p>
<p>And all living cells are very sensitive</p>
<p>to what the pH value is.</p>
<p>So your body is very interested in regulating that pH.</p>
<p>So we have to have enough oxygen for our normal metabolism,</p>
<p>and we have to get rid of the CO2 that we produce.</p>
<p>So how do we generate this air flow?</p>
<p>Well, the air comes into the lungs.</p>
<p>We have to expand the lungs.</p>
<p>And as the lungs expand,</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s like a balloon that you would pull apart.</p>
<p>The pressure inside that balloon drops,</p>
<p>and air will flow into the balloon.</p>
<p>So we put pressure on the lung to pull it apart.</p>
<p>That lowers the pressure in the air sacs called alveoli,</p>
<p>and air will flow in because pressure outside the body</p>
<p>is higher than pressure inside the body</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing this expansion, when you&rsquo;re inhaling.</p>
<p>What produces that?</p>
<p>Well, the principal muscle is the diaphragm,</p>
<p>which is sitting inside the body just below the lung.</p>
<p>And when you want to inhale,</p>
<p>you basically contract the diaphragm and it pulls it down.</p>
<p>And as it pulls it down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inserting pressure forces on the lung.</p>
<p>The lung wants to expand.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ribcage is gonna rotate up and out,</p>
<p>and therefore expanding the cavity, the thoracic cavity.</p>
<p>At the end of inspiration,</p>
<p>under normal conditions when you&rsquo;re at rest,</p>
<p>you just relax, and it&rsquo;s like pulling on a spring.</p>
<p>You pull down a spring and you let go and it relaxes.</p>
<p>So you inhale and you exhale.</p>
<p>Inhale, relax, and exhale.</p>
<p>So the exhale is passive?</p>
<p>At rest, it&rsquo;s passive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into what happens when you need to increase</p>
<p>the amount of air you&rsquo;re bringing in</p>
<p>because your ventilation,</p>
<p>your metabolism goes up like doing exercise.</p>
<p>Now, the muscles themselves,</p>
<p>the skeletal muscles don&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>unless the nervous system tells them to do something.</p>
<p>And when the nervous system tells them to do something,</p>
<p>they contract.</p>
<p>So there are specialized neurons in the spinal cord</p>
<p>and above the spinal cord,</p>
<p>the region called the brainstem,</p>
<p>which go to respiratory muscles,</p>
<p>in particular for inspiration,</p>
<p>the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles</p>
<p>in the ribcage, and they contract.</p>
<p>So these respiratory muscles,</p>
<p>these inspiratory muscles become active.</p>
<p>And they become active for a period of time.</p>
<p>Then they become silent.</p>
<p>And when they become silent,</p>
<p>the muscles then relax back</p>
<p>to their original resting level.</p>
<p>Where does that activity in these neurons</p>
<p>that innovate the muscle, which are called motor neurons,</p>
<p>where does that originate?</p>
<p>Well, this was a question that&rsquo;s been bandied around</p>
<p>for thousands of years.</p>
<p>And when I was a beginning assistant professor,</p>
<p>it was fairly high priority for me</p>
<p>to try and figure that out</p>
<p>because I wanted to understand</p>
<p>where this rhythm of breathing was coming from.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t know where it was coming from</p>
<p>until you knew where it was coming from.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t phrase that properly.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t understand how it was being done</p>
<p>until you know where to look.</p>
<p>So we did a lot of experiments,</p>
<p>which I can go into detail,</p>
<p>and finally found there was a region in the brainstem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, once again, this region</p>
<p>sort of above the spinal cord,</p>
<p>which was critical for generating this rhythm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the pre-Butzinger complex.</p>
<p>And we could talk about how that was named.</p>
<p>This small site, which contains in humans</p>
<p>a few thousand neurons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s located on either side,</p>
<p>and it works in tandem.</p>
<p>And every breath begins</p>
<p>with neurons in this region beginning to be active.</p>
<p>And those neurons then connect,</p>
<p>ultimately, to these motor neurons</p>
<p>going to the diaphragm and to the external intercostals,</p>
<p>causing them to be active</p>
<p>and causing this inspiratory effort.</p>
<p>When the neurons in the pre-Butzinger complex</p>
<p>finish their burst of activity,</p>
<p>then inspiration stops,</p>
<p>and then you begin to exhale</p>
<p>because of this passive recall of the lung and rib cage.</p>
<p>Could I just briefly interrupt you</p>
<p>to ask a few quick questions</p>
<p>before we move forward in this very informative answer?</p>
<p>And the two questions are,</p>
<p>is there anything known about the activation</p>
<p>of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles</p>
<p>between the ribs as it relates to nose</p>
<p>versus mouth breathing?</p>
<p>Or are they activated in the equivalent way</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not someone is breathing</p>
<p>through their nose or mouth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we fully have the answer to that.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are differences</p>
<p>between nasal and mouth breathing.</p>
<p>At rest, the tendency is to do nasal breathing</p>
<p>because the air flows that are necessary</p>
<p>for normal breathing is easily managed</p>
<p>by passing through the nasal cavities.</p>
<p>However, when your ventilation needs to increase,</p>
<p>like during exercise, you need to move more air,</p>
<p>you do that through your mouth</p>
<p>because the airways are much larger then,</p>
<p>and therefore you can move much more air.</p>
<p>But at the level of the intercostals and the diaphragm,</p>
<p>their contraction is almost agnostic</p>
<p>to whether or not the nose and mouth are open.</p>
<p>Okay, so if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason to suspect that there are particular,</p>
<p>perhaps even non-overlapping sets of neurons</p>
<p>in pre-Buttsinger area of the brainstem</p>
<p>that trigger nasal versus mouth inhales?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would say that it&rsquo;s not that the pre-Buttsinger complex</p>
<p>is not concerned and cannot influence that,</p>
<p>but it does not appear as if there&rsquo;s any modulation</p>
<p>of whether or not it&rsquo;s where the air is coming from,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s coming through your nasal passages</p>
<p>or through your mouth.</p>
<p>Great, thank you.</p>
<p>And then the other question I have</p>
<p>is that these intercostal muscles between the ribs</p>
<p>that move the ribs up and out, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>and the diaphragm, are those skeletal,</p>
<p>or as the Brits would say, skeletal muscles,</p>
<p>or smooth muscles?</p>
<p>What type of muscle are we talking about here?</p>
<p>As I said earlier, these are skeletal,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say they were skeletal muscles,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re muscles that need neural input</p>
<p>in order to move.</p>
<p>You talked about smooth muscles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re specialized muscles like we have in the gut</p>
<p>and in the heart, and these are muscles</p>
<p>that are capable of actually contracting</p>
<p>and relaxing on their own.</p>
<p>So the heart beats, it doesn&rsquo;t need neural input</p>
<p>in order to beat.</p>
<p>The neural inputs modulate the strength of it</p>
<p>and the frequency, but they beat on their own.</p>
<p>The skeletal muscles involved in breathing</p>
<p>need neural input.</p>
<p>Now, there are smooth muscles that have an influence</p>
<p>on breathing, and these are muscles</p>
<p>that are lining the airways.</p>
<p>And so the airways have smooth muscle,</p>
<p>and when they become activated,</p>
<p>the smooth muscle can contract or relax.</p>
<p>And when they contract inappropriately</p>
<p>is when you have problems breathing like an asthma.</p>
<p>Asthma is a condition where you get</p>
<p>inappropriate constriction of the smooth muscles</p>
<p>of the airways.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason to think that in asthma</p>
<p>that the pre-Buttsinger or these other neuronal centers</p>
<p>in the brain that activate breathing,</p>
<p>that they are involved or causal for things like asthma.</p>
<p>As of now, I would say the preponderance of evidence</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not involved,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve not really fully investigated that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sorry to break your flow,</p>
<p>but I was terribly interested in knowing answers</p>
<p>to those questions, and you provided them, so thank you.</p>
<p>Now, remind me again where I was in my-</p>
<p>We were just landing in pre-Buttsinger,</p>
<p>and we will return to the naming of pre-Buttsinger</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a wonderful and important story, really,</p>
<p>that I think people should be aware of.</p>
<p>But maybe you could march us through the brain centers</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve discovered and others have worked on as well</p>
<p>that control breathing, pre-Buttsinger</p>
<p>as well as related structures.</p>
<p>So when we discovered the pre-Buttsinger,</p>
<p>we thought that it was the primary source</p>
<p>of all rhythmic respiratory movements,</p>
<p>both inspiration and expiration.</p>
<p>The notion of a single source is like day or night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re all coming,</p>
<p>they all have the same origin,</p>
<p>that the earth rotates and day follows night.</p>
<p>And we thought that the pre-Buttsinger complex</p>
<p>would be inhalation, exhalation.</p>
<p>And then in a series of experiments</p>
<p>we did in the early part of 2000,</p>
<p>we discovered that there seemed to be another region</p>
<p>which was dominant in producing expiratory movements,</p>
<p>that is the exhalation.</p>
<p>We had made a fundamental mistake</p>
<p>with the discovery of the pre-Buttsinger,</p>
<p>not taking into account that at rest,</p>
<p>expiratory muscle activity or exhalation is passive.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the case, a group of neurons</p>
<p>that might generate active expiration,</p>
<p>that is to contract the expiratory muscles</p>
<p>like the abdominal muscles or the internal intercostals,</p>
<p>are just silent.</p>
<p>We just thought it wasn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>it was coming from one place.</p>
<p>But we got evidence that in fact</p>
<p>it may have been coming from another place.</p>
<p>And following up on these experiments,</p>
<p>we discovered that there was a second oscillator</p>
<p>and that oscillator is involved in generating</p>
<p>what we call active expiration,</p>
<p>that is this active, like a shh,</p>
<p>or when you begin to exercise,</p>
<p>you have to go, shh, shh, shh, shh,</p>
<p>and actually move that air out.</p>
<p>This group of cells, which is silent at rest,</p>
<p>suddenly becomes active to drive those muscles.</p>
<p>And it appears that it&rsquo;s an independent oscillator.</p>
<p>Maybe you could just clarify for people</p>
<p>what an oscillator is.</p>
<p>Okay, an oscillator is something that goes in a cycle.</p>
<p>So you can have a pendulum as an oscillator</p>
<p>going back and forth.</p>
<p>The Earth is an oscillator because it goes around</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s day and night.</p>
<p>Some people&rsquo;s moods are oscillating.</p>
<p>Oscillating.</p>
<p>And it depends how regular they are.</p>
<p>You can have oscillators that are highly regular</p>
<p>that are in a watch,</p>
<p>or you can have those that are sporadic or episodic.</p>
<p>Breathing is one of those oscillators</p>
<p>that for life has to be working continuously, 24-7.</p>
<p>It starts late in the third trimester</p>
<p>because it has to be working when you&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>And basically works throughout life.</p>
<p>And if it stops, if there&rsquo;s no intervention</p>
<p>beyond a few minutes, it will likely be fatal.</p>
<p>What is this second oscillator called?</p>
<p>Well, we found it in a region around the facial nucleus.</p>
<p>So we initially, when this region was initially identified,</p>
<p>we thought it was involved in sensing carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>It was what we call a central chemoreceptor.</p>
<p>That is, we want to keep carbon dioxide levels,</p>
<p>particularly in the brain, at a relatively stable level</p>
<p>because the brain is extraordinarily sensitive</p>
<p>to changes in pH.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a big shift in carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a big shift in brain pH</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;ll throw your brain,</p>
<p>if I can use the technical term, out of whack.</p>
<p>And so you want to regulate that.</p>
<p>And the way to regulate something in the brain</p>
<p>is you have a sensor in the brain.</p>
<p>And others basically identified</p>
<p>that the ventral surface of the brainstem,</p>
<p>that is the part of the brainstem that&rsquo;s on this side,</p>
<p>was critical for that.</p>
<p>And then we identified a structure</p>
<p>that was near the trapezoid nucleus.</p>
<p>It was not named in any of these neuroanatomical atlases.</p>
<p>So we just picked a name out of the hat</p>
<p>and we called it the retrotrapezoid nucleus.</p>
<p>I should clarify for people,</p>
<p>when Jack is saying trapezoid,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t mean the trapezoid muscles.</p>
<p>Trapezoid refers to the shape of this nucleus,</p>
<p>this cluster of neurons.</p>
<p>Parafacial makes me think that this general area</p>
<p>is involved in something related to mouth or face.</p>
<p>Is it an area rich with neurons</p>
<p>controlling other parts of the face,</p>
<p>eye blinks, nose twitches, lip curls, lip smacks?</p>
<p>If you go back in an evolutionary sense,</p>
<p>and a lot of things that are hard to figure out</p>
<p>begin to make sense when you look at the evolution</p>
<p>of the nervous system,</p>
<p>when control of facial muscles,</p>
<p>going back to more primitive creatures,</p>
<p>because they had to take things in their mouth for eating,</p>
<p>so we call that the face sort of developed.</p>
<p>The eyes were there, the mouth is there.</p>
<p>These nuclei that contained the motor neurons,</p>
<p>a lot of the control systems for them</p>
<p>developed in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>So if you think about the face,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of sub-nuclei around there</p>
<p>that had various roles</p>
<p>at various different times in evolution.</p>
<p>And at one point in evolution,</p>
<p>the facial muscles were probably very important</p>
<p>in moving fluid in and out of the mouth</p>
<p>and moving air in and out of the mouth.</p>
<p>And so part of these many different sub-nuclei</p>
<p>now seems to be in mammals</p>
<p>to be involved in the control of expiratory muscles.</p>
<p>But we have to remember that mammals are very special</p>
<p>when it comes to breathing,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re the only class of vertebrates</p>
<p>that have a diaphragm.</p>
<p>If you look at amphibians and reptiles,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a diaphragm.</p>
<p>And the way they breathe</p>
<p>is not by actively inspiring and passively expiring.</p>
<p>They breathe by actively expiring and passively inspiring</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have a powerful inspiratory muscle.</p>
<p>And somewhere along the line, the diaphragm developed.</p>
<p>And there are lots of theories about how it developed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s particularly clear.</p>
<p>There was something you can find in alligators and lizards.</p>
<p>That could have turned into a muscle that was the diaphragm.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about the diaphragm</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s mechanically extremely efficient.</p>
<p>And what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, if you look at how oxygen gets from outside the body</p>
<p>into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>the critical passage is across the membrane in the lung.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the alveolar capillary membrane.</p>
<p>The alveolus is part of the lung</p>
<p>and the blood runs through capillaries,</p>
<p>which are the smallest tubes in the circulatory system.</p>
<p>And at that point, oxygen can go from the air-filled alveolus</p>
<p>into the blood.</p>
<p>Which is amazing.</p>
<p>I find that amazing.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s just purely mechanical,</p>
<p>the idea that we have these little sacs in our lungs,</p>
<p>we inhale and the air goes in</p>
<p>and literally the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Passes into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>But the rate at which it passes</p>
<p>will depend on the characteristics of the membrane,</p>
<p>what the distance is between the alveolus</p>
<p>and the blood vessel, the capillary.</p>
<p>But the key element is the surface area.</p>
<p>The bigger the surface area,</p>
<p>the more oxygen that can pass through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely a passive process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no magic about making oxygen go in.</p>
<p>Now, how do you get a pack,</p>
<p>a large surface area in a small chest?</p>
<p>Well, you start out with one tube, which is the trachea.</p>
<p>The trachea expands.</p>
<p>Now you have two tubes.</p>
<p>Then you have four tubes and it keeps branching.</p>
<p>At some point, at the end of those branches,</p>
<p>you put a little sphere, which is an alveolus.</p>
<p>And that determines what the surface area is going to be.</p>
<p>Now, you then have a mechanical problem.</p>
<p>You have this surface area.</p>
<p>You have to be able to pull it apart.</p>
<p>So imagine you have a little square of elastic membrane.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of force to pull it apart.</p>
<p>But now if you increase it by 50 times,</p>
<p>you need a lot more force to pull it apart.</p>
<p>So amphibians, who were breathing</p>
<p>not by compressing the lungs</p>
<p>and then just passively expanding it,</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t able to generate a lot of force.</p>
<p>So they have relatively few branches.</p>
<p>So if you look at the surface area</p>
<p>that they pack in their lungs,</p>
<p>relative to their body size, it&rsquo;s not very impressive.</p>
<p>Whereas when you get to mammals,</p>
<p>the amount of branching that you have</p>
<p>is you have four to 500 million alveoli.</p>
<p>How, if we were to take those four to 5 million alveoli?</p>
<p>A hundred million, four to five, a hundred million.</p>
<p>A hundred million, excuse me.</p>
<p>And lay those out flat,</p>
<p>what sort of surface area are we talking about?</p>
<p>About 70 square meters,</p>
<p>which is about a third the size of a tennis court.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So you have a membrane inside of you,</p>
<p>a third the size of a tennis court</p>
<p>that you actually have to expand every breath.</p>
<p>And you do that without exerting much of a,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you have this amazing muscle,</p>
<p>the diaphragm, which because of its positioning,</p>
<p>just by moving two thirds of an inch down</p>
<p>is able to expand that membrane enough</p>
<p>to move air into the lungs.</p>
<p>Now, at rest, the value of air in your lungs</p>
<p>is about two and a half liters.</p>
<p>Do we need to convert that to quarts?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about two and a half liters.</p>
<p>When you take a breath,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking another 500 milliliters or half a liter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the size maybe of my fist.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re increasing the volume by 20%.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re doing that by pulling</p>
<p>on this 70 square meter membrane.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s enough to bring enough fresh air into the lung</p>
<p>to mix in with the air that&rsquo;s already there</p>
<p>that the oxygen levels in your bloodstream</p>
<p>goes from a partial pressure of oxygen,</p>
<p>which is 40 millimeters of mercury</p>
<p>to a hundred millimeters of mercury.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a huge increase in oxygen</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s enough to sustain normal metabolism.</p>
<p>So we have this amazing mechanical advantage</p>
<p>by having a diaphragm.</p>
<p>Do you think that our brains are larger than that</p>
<p>of other mammals in part</p>
<p>because of the amount of oxygen</p>
<p>that we have been able to bring into our system?</p>
<p>I would say a key step in the ability</p>
<p>to develop a large brain</p>
<p>that has a continuous demand for oxygen is the diaphragm.</p>
<p>Without a diaphragm, you&rsquo;re an amphibian.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another solution to increasing oxygen uptake,</p>
<p>which is the way birds breathe,</p>
<p>but birds have other limitations</p>
<p>and they still can&rsquo;t get brains as big as mammals have.</p>
<p>So the brain utilizes maybe 20%</p>
<p>of all the oxygen that we intake</p>
<p>and it needs it continuously.</p>
<p>The brain doesn&rsquo;t want to be neglected.</p>
<p>So this puts certain demands on the breathing system.</p>
<p>In other words, you can&rsquo;t shut it down for a while,</p>
<p>which poses other issues.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re born and you have to mature.</p>
<p>You have the small body, you have a small lung,</p>
<p>you have a very pliant rib cage,</p>
<p>and now you have to develop into an adult,</p>
<p>which has a stiffer rib cage.</p>
<p>And so there are changes happening</p>
<p>in your brain and your body</p>
<p>where the neural control of breathing</p>
<p>has to change on the fly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like for things like vision,</p>
<p>where you have the opportunity to sleep</p>
<p>and while you&rsquo;re sleeping,</p>
<p>the brain is capable of doing things</p>
<p>that are not easy to do during wakefulness,</p>
<p>like the construction crew comes in during sleep.</p>
<p>The change in breathing have been described</p>
<p>as trying to build an airplane while it&rsquo;s flying.</p>
<p>Basically what Jack is saying</p>
<p>is that respiration science is more complex</p>
<p>and hardworking than vision science,</p>
<p>which is a direct jab at me</p>
<p>that some of you might&rsquo;ve missed,</p>
<p>but I definitely did not miss.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that you always take the opportunity</p>
<p>like a good New Yorker</p>
<p>to give me a good healthy intellectual jab.</p>
<p>A question related to diaphragmatic breathing</p>
<p>versus non-diaphragmatic breathing,</p>
<p>because the way you describe it,</p>
<p>the diaphragm is always involved,</p>
<p>but over the years,</p>
<p>whether it be for yoga class or a breath work thing,</p>
<p>or you hear online that we should be breathing</p>
<p>with our diaphragm,</p>
<p>that rather than lifting our rib cage when we breathe</p>
<p>and our chest, that it is healthier, in air quotes,</p>
<p>or better somehow to have the belly expand when we inhale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any particular studies</p>
<p>that have really examined the direct health benefits</p>
<p>of diaphragmatic versus non-diaphragmatic breathing,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t mind commenting</p>
<p>on anything you&rsquo;re aware of</p>
<p>as it relates to diaphragmatic</p>
<p>versus non-diaphragmatic breathing,</p>
<p>whether or not people tend to be diaphragmatic breathers</p>
<p>by default, et cetera,</p>
<p>that would be, I think, interesting to a number of people.</p>
<p>Well, I think by default,</p>
<p>we are obligate diaphragm breathers.</p>
<p>There may be pathologies where the diaphragm is compromised</p>
<p>and you have to use other muscles,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>Certainly, at rest,</p>
<p>other muscles can take over,</p>
<p>but if you need to increase your ventilation,</p>
<p>the diaphragm is very important.</p>
<p>It would be hard to increase your ventilation otherwise.</p>
<p>Do you pay attention to whether or not</p>
<p>you are breathing in a manner</p>
<p>where your belly goes out a little bit as you inhale?</p>
<p>Because I can do it both ways, right?</p>
<p>I can inhale, bring my belly in,</p>
<p>or I can inhale, push my diaphragm and belly out,</p>
<p>not the diaphragm out,</p>
<p>but, and that&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a completely different muscle set</p>
<p>for each version.</p>
<p>Well, in the context of things like breath practice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit agnostic about the effects</p>
<p>of some of the different patterns of breathing.</p>
<p>Clearly, some are gonna work through different mechanisms,</p>
<p>and we can talk about that,</p>
<p>but at certain level, for example,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s primarily diaphragm</p>
<p>where you move your abdomen or not,</p>
<p>I am agnostic about it.</p>
<p>I think that the changes that breathing induces</p>
<p>in emotion and cognition,</p>
<p>I have different ideas about what the influence is,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see that primarily</p>
<p>as how which particular muscles you&rsquo;re choosing,</p>
<p>but that just could be my own prejudice.</p>
<p>Okay, and we will return to that</p>
<p>as a general theme in a little bit.</p>
<p>I wanna ask you about sighing.</p>
<p>One of the many great gifts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve given us over the years</p>
<p>is an understanding of these things</p>
<p>that we call physiological sighs.</p>
<p>Could you tell us about physiological sighs,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s known about them,</p>
<p>what your particular interest in them is,</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re good for?</p>
<p>Very interesting and important question.</p>
<p>So everyone has a sense of what a sigh is.</p>
<p>We certainly, when we&rsquo;re emotional in some ways,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re stressed, we&rsquo;re particularly happy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take a, we&rsquo;ll sigh.</p>
<p>It turns out that we&rsquo;re sighing all the time,</p>
<p>and when I would ask people</p>
<p>who are not particularly knowledgeable</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t read my papers or James Nestor&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>listen to your podcast,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually off by two orders of magnitude</p>
<p>about how frequently we sigh on the low side.</p>
<p>In other words, they say once an hour,</p>
<p>10 times a day.</p>
<p>We sigh about every five minutes,</p>
<p>and I would encourage anyone who finds that</p>
<p>to be a unbelievable fact</p>
<p>is to lie down in a quiet room</p>
<p>and just breathe normally,</p>
<p>just relax, just let go,</p>
<p>and just pay attention to your breathing,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find that every couple of minutes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking a deep breath,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>You know, it just happens.</p>
<p>Now why?</p>
<p>Well, we have to go back to the lung again.</p>
<p>The lung has these 500 million alveoli,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very tiny.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re 200 microns across.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re really, really tiny,</p>
<p>and you can think of them as fluid-filled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fluid-lined,</p>
<p>and the reason they&rsquo;re fluid-lined</p>
<p>has to do with the esoterica</p>
<p>of the mechanics of that.</p>
<p>It makes it a little easier to stretch them</p>
<p>with this fluid line,</p>
<p>which is called surfactant,</p>
<p>and surfactant is important during development.</p>
<p>It is a determining factor</p>
<p>when premature infants are born.</p>
<p>If they do not have lung surfactant,</p>
<p>it makes it much more challenging</p>
<p>to take care of them</p>
<p>than after they have lung surfactant,</p>
<p>which is sometime, if I remember correctly,</p>
<p>in the late second, early third trimester,</p>
<p>which it appears.</p>
<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s fluid-lined.</p>
<p>Now think of a balloon that you would blow up,</p>
<p>but now before you blow it up,</p>
<p>fill the balloon with water.</p>
<p>Squeeze all the water out,</p>
<p>and now when you squeeze all the water out,</p>
<p>you notice the size of the balloons stick to each other.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because water has what&rsquo;s called surface tension,</p>
<p>and when you have two surfaces of water together,</p>
<p>they actually tend to stick to each other.</p>
<p>Now when you try and blow that balloon up,</p>
<p>you know that it,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll notice if you&rsquo;ve ever done it before,</p>
<p>that the balloon is a little harder to inflate</p>
<p>than if it were dry on the inside.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because you have to overcome that surface tension.</p>
<p>Well, your alveoli have a tendency to collapse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 500 million of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not collapsing at a very high rate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a slow rate that&rsquo;s not trivial.</p>
<p>And when an alveolus collapses,</p>
<p>it no longer can receive oxygen or take carbon dioxide out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of taken out of the equation.</p>
<p>Now if you have 500 million of them and you lose 10,</p>
<p>no big deal.</p>
<p>But if they keep collapsing,</p>
<p>you can lose a significant part</p>
<p>of the surface area of your lung.</p>
<p>Now, a normal breath is not enough to pop them open.</p>
<p>But if you take a deep breath,</p>
<p>it pops them open.</p>
<p>Through nose or mouth.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Or?</p>
<p>Just increase that lung volume,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just pulling on the lungs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll pop open about every five minutes.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re doing it every five minutes</p>
<p>in order to maintain the health of our lung.</p>
<p>In the early days of mechanical ventilation,</p>
<p>which was used to treat polio victims,</p>
<p>who had weakness of their respiratory muscles,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be put in these big steel tubes.</p>
<p>And the way they would work</p>
<p>is that the pressure outside the body would drop.</p>
<p>That would put a expansion pressure on the lungs.</p>
<p>Excuse me, on the ribcage.</p>
<p>The ribcage would expand and then the lung would expand.</p>
<p>And then the pressure would go back to normal</p>
<p>and the lung and ribcage would go back to normal.</p>
<p>This was great for getting ventilation,</p>
<p>but there was a relatively high mortality rate.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>And one solution was to just give bigger breaths.</p>
<p>They gave bigger breaths and the mortality rate dropped.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until, I think it was the 50s,</p>
<p>where they realized that they didn&rsquo;t have to increase</p>
<p>every breath to be big.</p>
<p>What they needed to do is every so often</p>
<p>they need to have one big breath.</p>
<p>So they gave a couple of minutes of normal breaths</p>
<p>and then one big breath,</p>
<p>just mimicking the physiological size.</p>
<p>And there the mortality rate dropped significantly.</p>
<p>And if you see someone on a ventilator in the hospital,</p>
<p>if you watch, every couple of minutes</p>
<p>that you see the membrane move up and down,</p>
<p>every couple of minutes, there&rsquo;ll be a super breath</p>
<p>and that pops it open.</p>
<p>So there are these mechanisms for these physiological size.</p>
<p>So just like with the collapse of the lungs</p>
<p>where you need a big pressure to pop it open,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing with the alveoli.</p>
<p>You need a bigger pressure</p>
<p>and a normal breath is not enough.</p>
<p>So you have to take a big inhale.</p>
<p>And what nature has done is instead of requiring us</p>
<p>to remember to do it, it does it automatically.</p>
<p>And it does it about every five minutes.</p>
<p>And one of the questions we asked is how is this happening?</p>
<p>Why every five minutes?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s doing it?</p>
<p>And we got into it through a backdoor.</p>
<p>Typical of the way a lot of science gets done,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a serendipitous event where you run across a paper</p>
<p>and something clicks and you just, you follow it up.</p>
<p>Sometimes you go down blind ends,</p>
<p>but this turned out to be incredibly productive.</p>
<p>One of the guys in my lab was reading a paper about stress</p>
<p>and during stress, lots of things happen in the body.</p>
<p>One of which is that the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which is very reactive to body state,</p>
<p>releases peptides, which are specialized molecules,</p>
<p>which then circulate throughout the brain and body</p>
<p>to have particular effects,</p>
<p>usually to help deal better with the stress.</p>
<p>And one class of the peptides that are released</p>
<p>are called Bomberson-related peptides.</p>
<p>And he also realized, because he was a breathing guy,</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re stressed, you sigh more.</p>
<p>So we said, all right, maybe they&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>Bomberson is relatively cheap to buy.</p>
<p>We said, let&rsquo;s buy some Bomberson,</p>
<p>throw it in the brainstem, let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>And one of the nice things about some experiments</p>
<p>that we try to design is to fail quickly.</p>
<p>So here we had the idea, we throw Bomberson in</p>
<p>and if Bomberson did nothing,</p>
<p>nothing lost, maybe $50 to buy the Bomberson.</p>
<p>But if it did something, it might be of some interest.</p>
<p>One afternoon, he did the experiment.</p>
<p>And he comes to me, he says,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t quote exactly what he said</p>
<p>because it might need to be censored,</p>
<p>but he said, look at this.</p>
<p>And it was in a rat.</p>
<p>Rats sigh about every two minutes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re smaller than we are</p>
<p>and they need to sigh more often.</p>
<p>Their sigh rate went from 20 to 30 per hour</p>
<p>to 500 per hour when he put Bomberson</p>
<p>into the prebutzinger complex.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>And the way he did that is he took</p>
<p>a very, very fine glass needle and anesthetized a rat</p>
<p>and inserted that needle directly</p>
<p>into the prebutzinger complex.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a generalized delivery of the peptide,</p>
<p>it was localized to the prebutzinger</p>
<p>and the sigh rate went through the roof.</p>
<p>And I would add that that was an important experiment</p>
<p>to deliver the Bomberson directly to that site</p>
<p>because one could have concluded</p>
<p>that the injection of the Bomberson increased sighing</p>
<p>because it increased stress</p>
<p>rather than directly increased sighing.</p>
<p>Amongst hundreds of other possible interpretations.</p>
<p>So the precision here is very important</p>
<p>and that goes back to what I said at the very beginning.</p>
<p>Knowing where this is happening</p>
<p>allows you to do the proper investigations.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t know where the inspiratory rhythm</p>
<p>was originating, we never could have done this experiment.</p>
<p>And so then we did another experiment.</p>
<p>We said, okay, what happens if we take the cells</p>
<p>in the prebutzinger that are responding to the peptides?</p>
<p>So neurons will respond to a peptide</p>
<p>because they have specialized receptors for that peptide.</p>
<p>And not every neuron expresses those receptors.</p>
<p>In the prebutzinger complex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a few hundred out of thousands.</p>
<p>So we used the technique we had used before.</p>
<p>And this is a technique developed by Doug Lappy</p>
<p>down in San Diego,</p>
<p>where you could take a peptide</p>
<p>and conjugate it with a molecule called saprin.</p>
<p>Saprin is a plant-derived molecule</p>
<p>which is a cousin to ricin.</p>
<p>And many of your listeners may have heard of ricin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ribosomal toxin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nasty.</p>
<p>A single stab with an umbrella will kill you,</p>
<p>which is something that supposedly happened</p>
<p>to a Bulgarian diplomat by a Russian operative</p>
<p>on a bridge in London.</p>
<p>He got stabbed.</p>
<p>And the way ricin works is it goes inside a cell,</p>
<p>crosses the cell membrane, goes inside the cell,</p>
<p>kills the cell, then it goes to the next cell,</p>
<p>and then the next cell, and then the next cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s firstly impossible to work on in a lab</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t let you touch it.</p>
<p>Ricin.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve worked with saprin many times.</p>
<p>Saprin is safe because it doesn&rsquo;t cross cell membranes.</p>
<p>So you get an injection of saprin,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t do anything because it stays outside of cells.</p>
<p>Please, nobody do that,</p>
<p>even though it doesn&rsquo;t cross cell membranes.</p>
<p>Please, nobody inject saprin,</p>
<p>whether or not you are a operative or otherwise.</p>
<p>Thank you, Andrew, for protecting me there.</p>
<p>But what Doug Lappi figured out</p>
<p>is that when a ligand binds to a receptor,</p>
<p>that is, when a molecule binds to its receptor,</p>
<p>in many cases, that receptor-ligand complex</p>
<p>gets pulled inside the cell.</p>
<p>So it goes from the membrane of the cell inside the cell.</p>
<p>Sure, like you can&rsquo;t go to the dance alone,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re coupled up, you get in the door.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So what he figured out is he put saprin to the peptide,</p>
<p>the peptide binds to its receptor, it gets internalized,</p>
<p>and then when it&rsquo;s inside the cell,</p>
<p>saprin does the same thing that ricin does.</p>
<p>It kills the cell.</p>
<p>But then it can&rsquo;t go into the next cell.</p>
<p>So the only cells that get killed,</p>
<p>or the more polite term, ablated,</p>
<p>are cells that express that receptor.</p>
<p>So if you have a big conglomeration of cells,</p>
<p>you have a few thousand,</p>
<p>and only 50 of them express that receptor,</p>
<p>then you inject the saprin conjugated to the ligand,</p>
<p>to the peptide, and only those 50 cells die.</p>
<p>So we took bombicin conjugated to saprin,</p>
<p>injected in the prebiotic complex of rats,</p>
<p>and it took about a couple of days</p>
<p>for the saprin to actually ablate cells.</p>
<p>And what happened is that the mice started sighing less</p>
<p>and less, excuse me, the rats started sighing less</p>
<p>and less and less and less, and essentially stopped sighing.</p>
<p>So your student, or postdoc, was it,</p>
<p>murdered these cells, and as a consequence,</p>
<p>the sighing goes away.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>What was the consequence of eliminating sighing</p>
<p>on the internal state or the behavior of the rats?</p>
<p>In other words, if one can&rsquo;t sigh,</p>
<p>generate physiological sighs,</p>
<p>what is the consequence on state of mind?</p>
<p>You would imagine that carbon dioxide</p>
<p>would build up more readily</p>
<p>or to higher levels in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and that the animals would be more stressed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of logical extension</p>
<p>of the way we set it up.</p>
<p>It was less benign than that.</p>
<p>When the animals got to the point</p>
<p>where they weren&rsquo;t sighing,</p>
<p>then, and we did not determine this,</p>
<p>but the presumption was that their lung function</p>
<p>significantly deteriorated,</p>
<p>and their whole health deteriorated significantly,</p>
<p>and we had to sacrifice them.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t tell you whether they were stressed or not,</p>
<p>but their breathing got to be significantly</p>
<p>deteriorated that we sacrificed them at that point.</p>
<p>Now, we don&rsquo;t know whether that is specifically related</p>
<p>to the fact they didn&rsquo;t sigh,</p>
<p>or that there was secondary damage</p>
<p>due to the fact that some cells die,</p>
<p>so we never determined that.</p>
<p>Now, after we did this study,</p>
<p>to be candid, it wasn&rsquo;t a high priority for us</p>
<p>to get this out the door and publish it.</p>
<p>So it stayed on the shelf.</p>
<p>And then I got a phone call</p>
<p>from a graduate student at Stanford, Kevin Yackel,</p>
<p>who starts asking me all these interesting questions</p>
<p>about breathing, and I&rsquo;m happy to answer them,</p>
<p>but at some point, it concerned me</p>
<p>because he was working for a renowned biochemist</p>
<p>who worked on lung and Drosophila fruit flies,</p>
<p>Mark Krasnow.</p>
<p>Yeah, my next-door colleague.</p>
<p>Right, and I said, why are you asking me this?</p>
<p>And he said, I was an undergraduate at UCLA,</p>
<p>and you gave a lecture in my undergraduate class,</p>
<p>and I was curious about breathing ever since.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of those things which, as a professor,</p>
<p>you love to hear, that actually is something</p>
<p>you really affected the life of a student.</p>
<p>Well, and you birthed a competitor,</p>
<p>but you had only yourself to blame.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at that as a competitor.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s enough interesting things to go on.</p>
<p>I know some of our neuroscience colleagues say,</p>
<p>you can work in my lab, but then when you leave my lab,</p>
<p>you got to work on something different.</p>
<p>No one I ever trained with said that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open field.</p>
<p>You want to work on something, you hop in the mix.</p>
<p>But there are people like that, neuroscientists like that.</p>
<p>I never felt like that.</p>
<p>I hear that their breathing apparati are disrupted,</p>
<p>and it causes a brain dysfunction</p>
<p>that leads to the behavior you just described.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not true, but in terms of the,</p>
<p>so before we talk about the beautiful story</p>
<p>with Yackel and Krasnow and Feld lab,</p>
<p>I want to just make sure that I understand.</p>
<p>So if physiological size don&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>basically breathing overall suffers.</p>
<p>Well, that would go back to the observations</p>
<p>in polio victims in these high end lungs</p>
<p>where the principal deficit was there was no hyperinflation</p>
<p>of the lungs, and many of them deteriorated and died.</p>
<p>And just to stay on this one more moment</p>
<p>before we move to what you were about to describe,</p>
<p>we hear often that people will overdose</p>
<p>on drugs of various kinds because they stop breathing.</p>
<p>So barbiturates, alcohol combined with barbiturates</p>
<p>is a common cause of death for drug users</p>
<p>and contraindications of drugs and these kinds of things.</p>
<p>You hear all the time about celebrities dying</p>
<p>because they combined alcohol with barbiturates.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that the size that occur during sleep</p>
<p>or during states of deep, deep relaxation and sedation</p>
<p>that size recover the brain?</p>
<p>Because you could imagine that if the size don&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>as a consequence of some drug impacting these brain centers,</p>
<p>that that could be one cause</p>
<p>of basically asphyxiation and death.</p>
<p>If you look at the progression of any mammal to death,</p>
<p>you find that their breathing slows down,</p>
<p>a death due to, quote, natural causes.</p>
<p>Their breathing slows down, it will stop,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll gasp.</p>
<p>So we have the phrase dying gasp,</p>
<p>the super large breaths.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often described as an attempt to auto-resuscitate.</p>
<p>That is, you take that super deep breath</p>
<p>and that maybe it can kickstart the engine again.</p>
<p>We do not know the degree to such things as gasp</p>
<p>are really size that are particularly large.</p>
<p>And so if you suppress the ability to gasp</p>
<p>in an individual who is subject to an overdose,</p>
<p>then whereas they might have been able</p>
<p>to re-arouse their breathing,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s prevented, they don&rsquo;t get re-aroused.</p>
<p>So that is certainly a possibility.</p>
<p>But this has not been investigated.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things that I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>is in individuals who have</p>
<p>diseases which will affect pre-Butzinger complex.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s data in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>and multiple system atrophy,</p>
<p>which is another form of neurodegeneration,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s loss of neurons in pre-Butzinger.</p>
<p>And the question is, and it also may happen in ALS,</p>
<p>sometimes referred to as Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>
<p>These individuals often die during sleep.</p>
<p>We have an idea that we have not been able</p>
<p>to get anyone to test,</p>
<p>is that patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>patients with MLS,</p>
<p>typically breathe normally during wakefulness.</p>
<p>The disturbances that they have in breathing</p>
<p>is during sleep.</p>
<p>So Parkinson&rsquo;s patients at the end stages of the disease</p>
<p>often have significant disturbances in their sleep pattern,</p>
<p>but not during wakefulness.</p>
<p>And we think that what could be happening</p>
<p>is that the approximate cause of death</p>
<p>is not heart failure,</p>
<p>is that they become apnea,</p>
<p>they stop breathing and don&rsquo;t resuscitate.</p>
<p>And that resuscitation may or may not be due</p>
<p>to an explicit suppression of size,</p>
<p>but to an overall suppression of the whole apparatus</p>
<p>of the pre-Butzinger complex.</p>
<p>Got it, thank you.</p>
<p>So Yackel calls you up.</p>
<p>So he calls me up and he&rsquo;s great kid,</p>
<p>super smart.</p>
<p>And he tells me about these experiments that he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s looking in a database</p>
<p>to try and find out what molecules are enriched</p>
<p>in regions of the brain that are critical for breathing.</p>
<p>So we and others have mapped out these regions</p>
<p>in the brain stem.</p>
<p>And he was looking at one of these databases</p>
<p>to see what&rsquo;s enriched.</p>
<p>And I said, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Will you be willing to sort of share work together?</p>
<p>He says, no, my advisor doesn&rsquo;t want me to do that.</p>
<p>So I said, okay.</p>
<p>But Kevin&rsquo;s a great kid and I enjoyed talking to him</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a smart guy.</p>
<p>And what I found in academia</p>
<p>is that the smartest people</p>
<p>only want to hire people smarter than them</p>
<p>and have the preference to interact</p>
<p>with people smarter than them.</p>
<p>The faculty who are not at the highest level</p>
<p>and at every institution, there&rsquo;s a distribution.</p>
<p>There are ones above the mean and those below the mean.</p>
<p>Those who are below the mean are very threatened by that.</p>
<p>And I saw Kevin as like a shining light</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t care whether he was gonna out-compete me</p>
<p>because whatever he did was gonna help me in the field.</p>
<p>I did whatever I can to help, to work with Kevin.</p>
<p>So at one point, I got invited to give grand rounds</p>
<p>in neurology at Stanford.</p>
<p>Turns out an undergraduate student who had worked with me</p>
<p>was now head of the training program for neurologists</p>
<p>at Stanford and he invited me.</p>
<p>And at the end of my visit, I go to Mark Krasnow&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and Kevin is there and a postdoc, Pungley,</p>
<p>who was also working on a project was there.</p>
<p>And towards the end of the conversation,</p>
<p>the, Mark says to me, you know, we found this one molecule</p>
<p>which is highly concentrated</p>
<p>in an important region for breathing.</p>
<p>I said, oh, that&rsquo;s great, what is it?</p>
<p>And he says, I can&rsquo;t tell you because we wanna work on it.</p>
<p>So, of course I&rsquo;m disappointed, but I realized that</p>
<p>the ethic in some areas of science</p>
<p>or the custom in some areas of science</p>
<p>is that until you get a publication,</p>
<p>you be relatively restricted in sharing the information.</p>
<p>Mark and I are gonna have a chat when I get back.</p>
<p>Well, he may remember the story differently,</p>
<p>but I said, okay.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m walking out the door,</p>
<p>I remember these experiments I described to you</p>
<p>about bombosin and that was the only unusual molecule</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>So, the reason I&rsquo;m rushing out the door</p>
<p>is I have a flight to catch.</p>
<p>So, I stick my head in and I said,</p>
<p>is this molecule related to bombosin?</p>
<p>And then I run off, I don&rsquo;t even wait for them to reply.</p>
<p>I get to the airport, Mark calls me and he says,</p>
<p>bombosin, the peptide we found is related to bombosin,</p>
<p>what does it do?</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m not telling.</p>
<p>Oh my, I&rsquo;m so glad I wasn&rsquo;t involved in this collaboration.</p>
<p>No, no, but that was sort of a tease</p>
<p>because I said, well, let&rsquo;s work together on this.</p>
<p>And then we worked together on this.</p>
<p>It was a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma at that point.</p>
<p>So, Kevin Yackel is spectacular, has his own lab at UCSF.</p>
<p>And the work that I&rsquo;m familiar with from Kevin</p>
<p>is worth mentioning now, or I&rsquo;ll ask you to mention it,</p>
<p>which is this reciprocal relationship between brain state,</p>
<p>or we could even say emotional state and breathing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts on how breathing interacts</p>
<p>with other things in the brain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve beautifully described how breathing controls</p>
<p>the lungs, the diaphragm, and the interactions</p>
<p>between oxygen and carbon dioxide and so forth.</p>
<p>But as we know, when we get stressed,</p>
<p>our breathing changes.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re happy and relaxed, our breathing changes.</p>
<p>But also, if we change our breathing,</p>
<p>we, in some sense, can adjust our internal state.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between brain state and breathing?</p>
<p>And if you would, because I know you have a particular love</p>
<p>of one particular aspect of this,</p>
<p>what is the relationship between brain rhythms,</p>
<p>oscillations, if you will, and breathing?</p>
<p>This is a topic which has really intrigued me</p>
<p>over the past decade.</p>
<p>I would say before that, I was in my silo,</p>
<p>just interested about how the rhythm of breathing</p>
<p>is generated, and didn&rsquo;t really pay much attention</p>
<p>to this other stuff.</p>
<p>For some reason, I got interested in it,</p>
<p>and I think it was triggered by an article</p>
<p>in the New York Times about mindfulness.</p>
<p>Now, believe it or not, although I&rsquo;d lived in California</p>
<p>for 20 years at that time, I never heard of mindfulness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s staggering how isolated you can be from the real world.</p>
<p>And I Googled it, and there was a mindfulness institute</p>
<p>at UCLA, and they were giving courses in meditation.</p>
<p>So I said, oh, this is great, because I can now see</p>
<p>whether or not the breathing part of meditation</p>
<p>has anything to do with the purported effects</p>
<p>of meditation.</p>
<p>So I signed up for the course,</p>
<p>and as I joked to you before, I had two goals.</p>
<p>One was to see whether or not breathing had an effect,</p>
<p>and the other was to levitate.</p>
<p>Because I grew up in all these Kung Fu things,</p>
<p>and all the monks could levitate when they meditated,</p>
<p>so why not?</p>
<p>You know, we have a model in the lab,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do anything interesting</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re afraid of failing.</p>
<p>And if I fail to levitate, well, at least I tried.</p>
<p>And I should tell you now, I still haven&rsquo;t done it yet,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t given up yet.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t given up.</p>
<p>So I took this course in mindfulness,</p>
<p>and it became apparent to me</p>
<p>that the breathing part was actually critical.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t simply a distraction or a focus.</p>
<p>You know, they could have had you move your index finger</p>
<p>to the same effect, but I really believed</p>
<p>that the breathing part was involved.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not an unbiased observer,</p>
<p>so the question is, how can I demonstrate that?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel competent to do experiments in humans,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t feel I could design</p>
<p>the right experiments in humans,</p>
<p>but I felt, maybe I can study this in rodents.</p>
<p>So we got this idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna teach rodents to meditate.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s laughable,</p>
<p>but we said, but if we can,</p>
<p>then we can actually study how this happens.</p>
<p>So believe it or not, I was able to get</p>
<p>a sort of a starter grant, an R21 from NCCIH.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the National Complementary Medicine Institute.</p>
<p>A wonderful institute, I should mention.</p>
<p>Our government puts major tax dollars</p>
<p>toward studies of things like meditation, breath work,</p>
<p>supplements, herbs, acupuncture.</p>
<p>This is, I think, not well-known,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an incredible thing that our government does that,</p>
<p>and I think it deserves a nod and more funding.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s the kind of thing</p>
<p>that many of us, including many scientists,</p>
<p>thinks is too woo-woo and unsubstantiated,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re learning more and more.</p>
<p>You know, we used to laugh at neuroimmunology,</p>
<p>that the nervous system didn&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>to do with the immune system,</p>
<p>and pain itself can influence your immune system.</p>
<p>I mean, there are all these things that we&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>that we used to dismiss,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s real nuggets to be learned here.</p>
<p>So they went out on a limb</p>
<p>and they funded this particular project,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m gonna leap ahead,</p>
<p>because for three years,</p>
<p>we threw stuff up against the wall that didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>and recently, we had a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>We found a protocol by which we can get mice</p>
<p>to breathe slowly, awake mice to breathe slowly.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t tell you.</p>
<p>Normally, they don&rsquo;t breathe slowly.</p>
<p>No, no, in other words, whatever their normal breath is,</p>
<p>we could slow it down by a factor of 10,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fine doing that.</p>
<p>So we could do that for, we did that 30 minutes a day</p>
<p>for four weeks, okay, like a breath practice.</p>
<p>Do they levitate?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t measured that yet, I would say.</p>
<p>A priori, we haven&rsquo;t seen them floating</p>
<p>to the top of their cage, but we haven&rsquo;t weighed them.</p>
<p>Maybe they weigh less.</p>
<p>Maybe levitation is graded,</p>
<p>and so maybe if you weigh less,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of partial levitation.</p>
<p>In any case, we then tested them,</p>
<p>and we had control animals, mice,</p>
<p>where we did everything the same</p>
<p>except the manipulation we made</p>
<p>did not slow down their breathing,</p>
<p>but they went through everything else.</p>
<p>We then put them through a standard fear conditioning,</p>
<p>which we did with my colleague, Michael Fanzelow,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the real gurus of fear,</p>
<p>and we measured a standard test</p>
<p>is to put mice in a condition</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re concerned that receive a shock,</p>
<p>and their response is that they freeze,</p>
<p>and a measure of how fearful they are</p>
<p>is how long they freeze.</p>
<p>This is well-validated, and it&rsquo;s way above my pay grade</p>
<p>to describe the validity of the test, but it&rsquo;s very valid.</p>
<p>The control mice had a freezing time</p>
<p>which was just the same as ordinary mice would have.</p>
<p>The ones that went through our protocol</p>
<p>froze much, much less.</p>
<p>According to Michael, the degree to which</p>
<p>they showed less freezing was as much</p>
<p>as if there was a major manipulation in the amygdala,</p>
<p>which is a part of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important in fear processing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a staggering change.</p>
<p>The problem we have now is the grant ran out of money,</p>
<p>the postdoc working on it left,</p>
<p>and now we have to try and piece together everything,</p>
<p>but the data is spectacular.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll just pause you for a moment there</p>
<p>because I think that the, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about a rodent study,</p>
<p>but I think the benefits of doing rodent studies</p>
<p>that you can get deep into mechanism,</p>
<p>and for people that might think,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;ve known that meditation has these benefits,</p>
<p>why do you need to get mechanistic science?</p>
<p>I think that one thing that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>for people to remember is that, first of all,</p>
<p>as many people as one might think are meditating out there</p>
<p>or doing breath work,</p>
<p>a far, far, far greater number of people are not, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a, the majority of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take any time to do dedicated breath work</p>
<p>nor meditate, so whatever can incentivize people</p>
<p>would be wonderful,</p>
<p>but the other thing is that it&rsquo;s never really been clear</p>
<p>to me just how much meditation is required</p>
<p>for a real effect, meaning a practical effect.</p>
<p>People say 30 minutes a day, 20 minutes a day,</p>
<p>once a week, twice a week, same thing with breath work.</p>
<p>Finding minimum or effective thresholds</p>
<p>for changing neural circuitry is what I think</p>
<p>is the holy grail of all these practices,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s only going to be determined</p>
<p>by the sorts of mechanistic studies that you describe.</p>
<p>So this is wonderful.</p>
<p>I do hope the work gets completed,</p>
<p>and we can talk about ways that we can ensure</p>
<p>that that happens, but-</p>
<p>But let me add one thing to what you&rsquo;re saying, Andrew.</p>
<p>One of the issues, I think, for a lot of people</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a placebo effect.</p>
<p>That is, in humans, they can respond to something</p>
<p>even though the mechanism has nothing to do</p>
<p>with what the intervention is,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s easy to say that the meditative response</p>
<p>has a big component, which is a placebo effect.</p>
<p>My mice don&rsquo;t believe in the placebo effect,</p>
<p>and so if we could show there&rsquo;s a bona fide effect in mice,</p>
<p>it is convincing in ways that,</p>
<p>no matter how many human experiments you did,</p>
<p>the control for the placebo effect</p>
<p>is extremely difficult in humans.</p>
<p>In mice, it&rsquo;s a non-issue.</p>
<p>So I think that that, in and of itself,</p>
<p>would be an enormous message to send.</p>
<p>Excellent, and indeed, a better point.</p>
<p>I think a 30-minute-a-day meditation in these mice,</p>
<p>if I understand correctly, the meditation,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s breath practice.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s breath practice,</p>
<p>because presumably they&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>about their third eye center,</p>
<p>lotus position, levitation, whatever it is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not instructed as to what to do,</p>
<p>and if they were, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t do it anyway.</p>
<p>So 30 minutes a day</p>
<p>in which breathing is deliberately slowed,</p>
<p>or is slowed relative to their normal patterns of breathing.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>What was the frequency of sighing during that 30 minutes?</p>
<p>Unclear. We don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>Well, no, we have the data.</p>
<p>We just, we&rsquo;re analyzing the data.</p>
<p>To be determined, or to be announced at some point.</p>
<p>So the fear centers are altered in some way</p>
<p>that creates a shorter fear response to a foot shock.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What are some other examples that you are aware of</p>
<p>from work in your laboratory,</p>
<p>or work in other laboratories for that matter,</p>
<p>about interactions between breathing</p>
<p>and brain state or emotional state?</p>
<p>So this gets back to our prior conversation.</p>
<p>I sort of went off on that tangent.</p>
<p>We need, I think we need to think separately</p>
<p>of the effect of volitional changes of breathing</p>
<p>on emotion versus the effect,</p>
<p>the effect of brain state on breathing.</p>
<p>So the effect of brain state on breathing,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>is an effect presumably originating in higher centers,</p>
<p>if I can use that term, affecting breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, the reciprocal is that when you change breathing,</p>
<p>it affects your emotional state.</p>
<p>I think of those two things as different,</p>
<p>that may ultimately be tied together.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a landmark paper published in the 50s</p>
<p>where they stimulated in the amygdala of cats,</p>
<p>and depending on where they stimulated,</p>
<p>they got profound changes in breathing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like every pattern of breathing</p>
<p>you could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>They found a site in the amygdala</p>
<p>which could produce that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s clearly a powerful descending effect</p>
<p>coming from the amygdala, which is a major site</p>
<p>for processing emotion, fear, stress, and whatnot</p>
<p>that can affect breathing.</p>
<p>And clearly we have volitional control over breathing.</p>
<p>So we have profound effects there.</p>
<p>Now, I should say about emotional control of breathing,</p>
<p>I need to segue into talking about locked-in syndrome.</p>
<p>Locked-in syndrome is a devastating lesion</p>
<p>that happens in a part of the brainstem</p>
<p>where signals to controlled muscles are transmitted.</p>
<p>So the fibers coming from your motor cortex</p>
<p>go down to this part of the brainstem,</p>
<p>which is called the ventral pons.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a stroke there,</p>
<p>it can damage these pathways.</p>
<p>What happens in individuals who have locked-in syndrome</p>
<p>is they lose all volitional movement</p>
<p>except lateral movement of the eyes</p>
<p>and maybe the ability to blink.</p>
<p>The reason they&rsquo;re able to still blink and move their eyes</p>
<p>is that those control centers are rostral,</p>
<p>closer to, are not interrupted.</p>
<p>In other words, the interruption is below that.</p>
<p>They continue to breathe</p>
<p>and the centers for breathing</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t require that volitional command.</p>
<p>In any case, they&rsquo;re below that.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>So these people continue to breathe.</p>
<p>Normal intelligence, but they can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book called</p>
<p>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</p>
<p>about a young man who this happens to</p>
<p>and he describes his life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a real testament to the human condition</p>
<p>that he does this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a remarkable book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a short book.</p>
<p>Did he write the book by blinking?</p>
<p>He did it by blinking to his caretaker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>And there was a movie, which I&rsquo;ve never seen,</p>
<p>with Javier Bardeen as the protagonist,</p>
<p>but the book I highly recommend anyone to read.</p>
<p>So I had colleagues studying an individual</p>
<p>who had locked-in syndrome</p>
<p>and this patient breathed very robotically,</p>
<p>totally consistent, very regular.</p>
<p>They gave the patient a low oxygen mixture to breathe.</p>
<p>Ventilation went up.</p>
<p>A CO2 mixture to breathe.</p>
<p>Ventilation went up.</p>
<p>So all the regulatory apparatus for breathing was there.</p>
<p>They asked the patient to hold his breath</p>
<p>or to breathe faster.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Just the patient recognized the command,</p>
<p>but couldn&rsquo;t change it.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden,</p>
<p>the patient&rsquo;s breathing changed considerably.</p>
<p>And they said to the patient, what happened?</p>
<p>They said, you told a joke and I laughed.</p>
<p>And they went back.</p>
<p>Whenever they told a joke that the patient found funny,</p>
<p>the patient&rsquo;s breathing pattern changed.</p>
<p>And you know your breathing pattern when you laugh</p>
<p>is you inhale, you go, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also very distinctive.</p>
<p>We have some neuroscience colleagues who will go unnamed</p>
<p>who if you heard them laugh 50 yards away,</p>
<p>you know exactly who they are.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ll name him.</p>
<p>Eric Kandel.</p>
<p>For one.</p>
<p>Has an inspiratory laugh.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s famous for a, as opposed to a, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very stereotyped,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s maintained in these people</p>
<p>who lose volitional control of breathing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an emotive component controlling your breathing,</p>
<p>which has nothing to do with your volitional control.</p>
<p>And it goes down to a different pathway</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not disrupted by this locked-in syndrome.</p>
<p>If you look at motor control of the face,</p>
<p>we have the volitional control of the face,</p>
<p>but we also have emotional control of the face,</p>
<p>which most of us can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>So when we look at another person,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to read a lot about what their emotional state is</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a lot about how primates communicate,</p>
<p>humans communicate.</p>
<p>And you have people who are good deceivers,</p>
<p>probably used car salesmen, poker players,</p>
<p>or now poker players, you know, have tells,</p>
<p>but many of them now wear, you know, dark glasses</p>
<p>because a lot of the tells you blink or whatnot.</p>
<p>Pupil size is a tell.</p>
<p>Pupil size, pupil size is a tell,</p>
<p>which is an autonomic function,</p>
<p>not a skeletal muscle function,</p>
<p>but we have all these skeletal muscles</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re controlling, which give us away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to get my imaging friends</p>
<p>to image some of the great actors</p>
<p>that we have in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>You mean brain imagers?</p>
<p>Brain imagers, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, brain imagers,</p>
<p>because I think when I ask you to smile,</p>
<p>I could tell that you&rsquo;re not happy,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re smiling because I ask you to smile.</p>
<p>I think I just-</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re about to crack a joke,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re old friends, so, you know.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not, that, you know,</p>
<p>when you see a picture, like at a birthday or whatnot,</p>
<p>and say cheese, you could tell</p>
<p>that at least half of the people are not happy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying cheese.</p>
<p>Whereas a great actor, when they&rsquo;re able to dissemble</p>
<p>in the fact that they&rsquo;re sad or they&rsquo;re happy,</p>
<p>you believe it, they&rsquo;re not faking it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s great acting.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think everyone could do that.</p>
<p>I think that the individuals who are able to do that</p>
<p>have some connection to the parts</p>
<p>of their emotive control system</p>
<p>that the rest of us don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Maybe they develop it through training and maybe not,</p>
<p>but I think that this can be imaged.</p>
<p>So I would like to get one of these great actors</p>
<p>in a imager and have them go through that</p>
<p>and then get a normal person</p>
<p>and see whether or not they can emulate that.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re gonna find big differences</p>
<p>in the way they control this emotive thing.</p>
<p>So this emotive control of the facial muscles,</p>
<p>I think is in large part similar</p>
<p>to the emotive control of breathing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that emotive control</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that volitional control,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re different, they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>Now, you asked me about the yackle stuff.</p>
<p>The yackle paper had to do with ascending,</p>
<p>that the effect of breathing on emotion.</p>
<p>What Kevin found was that there was a population</p>
<p>of neurons in the prebutzial complex</p>
<p>that were always looking to things</p>
<p>that are projecting ultimately emotive neurons.</p>
<p>He found the population of cells</p>
<p>that projected to locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Locus coeruleus, excuse me,</p>
<p>is one of those places in the brain</p>
<p>that seem to go everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a sprinkler system.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And influence mood,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve had podcasts about this.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on with the amygdala.</p>
<p>So, excuse me, the locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>So you get into the locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>you can now spray information</p>
<p>out throughout the entire brain.</p>
<p>He found specific cells that projected</p>
<p>from prebutzinger to locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>And that these cells are inspiratory modulated.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s been known for a long time,</p>
<p>since the 60s,</p>
<p>that if you look in the locus coeruleus of cats</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>you find many neurons that have respiratory modulation.</p>
<p>No one paid much attention to it.</p>
<p>I mean, why bother?</p>
<p>Not why bother paying attention,</p>
<p>but why would the brain bother to have these inputs?</p>
<p>So what Kevin did with Lindsey Schwartz</p>
<p>and Leeshan Loslier is they killed,</p>
<p>ablated those cells going to locus coeruleus</p>
<p>from prebutzinger.</p>
<p>And the animals became calmer.</p>
<p>And their EEG levels changed in ways</p>
<p>that are indicative that they became calmer.</p>
<p>And as I recall, they didn&rsquo;t just become calmer,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t really capable of high arousal states.</p>
<p>They were kind of flat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we really pursued that in the paper.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;d have to ask John Huguenin about that.</p>
<p>But I-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the other side of my lap,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll ask him.</p>
<p>But nonetheless,</p>
<p>that beautifully illustrates</p>
<p>how there is a bidirectional control, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a setting.</p>
<p>Emotion.</p>
<p>Well, no, the two stories of the locked-in syndrome</p>
<p>plus the Yackel paper</p>
<p>shows that emotional states influence breathing</p>
<p>and breathing influences emotional states.</p>
<p>But you mentioned inspiration,</p>
<p>which I always call inhalation,</p>
<p>but people will follow.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Those are interchangeable.</p>
<p>People can follow that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting papers from Noam Sobel&rsquo;s group</p>
<p>and from a number of other groups</p>
<p>that as we inhale or right after we inhale,</p>
<p>the brain is actually more alert</p>
<p>and capable of storing information than during exhales,</p>
<p>which I find incredible,</p>
<p>but it also makes sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to see things far better when my eyes are open</p>
<p>than when my eyelids are closed for that matter.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt,</p>
<p>I mean, Noam&rsquo;s work is great.</p>
<p>Let me backtrack a bit</p>
<p>because I want people to understand</p>
<p>that when we&rsquo;re talking about breathing</p>
<p>affecting emotional cognitive state,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not simply coming from pre-Butzinger.</p>
<p>There are at least,</p>
<p>well, there are several other sites,</p>
<p>and let me sort of,</p>
<p>I need to sort of go through that.</p>
<p>One is olfaction.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re breathing, normal breathing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inhaling and exhaling.</p>
<p>This is creating signals coming from the nasal mucosa</p>
<p>that is going back into the olfactory bulb</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s respiratory modulated.</p>
<p>And the olfactory bulb has a profound influence</p>
<p>and projections through many parts of the brain.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a signal arising from this rhythmic moving</p>
<p>of air in and out of the nose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going into the brain</p>
<p>that has contained in it a respiratory modulation.</p>
<p>So that signal is there.</p>
<p>The brain doesn&rsquo;t have to be using it,</p>
<p>but when it&rsquo;s discriminating odor and whatnot,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s riding on a oscillation,</p>
<p>which is respiratory related.</p>
<p>Another potential source is the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve is a major nerve,</p>
<p>which is containing afferents from all of the viscera.</p>
<p>Afferents just being signals too, yeah.</p>
<p>Signals from the viscera.</p>
<p>It also has signals coming from the brainstem down,</p>
<p>which are called efferents,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s getting major signals from the lung,</p>
<p>from the gut,</p>
<p>and this is going up into the brainstem.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>There are very powerful receptors in the lung</p>
<p>that are responding to the lung volume,</p>
<p>the lung stretch.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re baroreceptors.</p>
<p>Sorry, we have a number of them,</p>
<p>like the piezo receptors of this year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize, yeah.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re responding to the expansion</p>
<p>and relaxation of the lung.</p>
<p>And so if you record from the vagus nerve,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s a huge respiratory modulation</p>
<p>due to the mechanical changes in the lung.</p>
<p>Now, why that is of interest</p>
<p>is that for some forms of refractory depression,</p>
<p>electrostimulation of the vagus nerve</p>
<p>can provide tremendous relief.</p>
<p>Why this is the case still remains to be determined,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear that signals in the vagus nerve,</p>
<p>at least artificial signals in the vagus nerve,</p>
<p>can have a positive effect on reducing depression.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a leap to think that under normal circumstances</p>
<p>that that rhythm coming in from the vagus nerve</p>
<p>is playing a role in normal processing.</p>
<p>Okay, let me continue.</p>
<p>Calmed oxide and oxygen levels.</p>
<p>Now, under normal circumstances,</p>
<p>your oxygen levels are fine.</p>
<p>And unless you go to altitude,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really change very much.</p>
<p>But your CO2 levels can change quite a bit</p>
<p>with even a relatively small change</p>
<p>in your overall breathing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna change your pH level.</p>
<p>I have a colleague, Alicia Moret,</p>
<p>who is working with patients who are anxious,</p>
<p>and many of them hyperventilate.</p>
<p>And as a result of that hyperventilation,</p>
<p>their calmed oxide levels are low.</p>
<p>And she has developed a therapeutic treatment</p>
<p>where she trains these people to breathe slower</p>
<p>and to restore their CO2 levels back to normal,</p>
<p>and she gets relief in their anxiety.</p>
<p>So CO2 levels,</p>
<p>which are not gonna affect brain function</p>
<p>on a breath-by-breath level,</p>
<p>although it does fluctuate breath-by-breath,</p>
<p>but sort of as a continuous background,</p>
<p>can change.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s changed chronically,</p>
<p>we know that highly elevated levels of CO2</p>
<p>can produce panic attacks.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know the degree to which it gets exacerbated</p>
<p>by people who have a panic attack,</p>
<p>the degree to which their ambient CO2 levels</p>
<p>are affecting their degree of discomfort.</p>
<p>What about people who tend to be too calm,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re feeling sleepy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re under-breathing as opposed to over-breathing?</p>
<p>Is there any knowledge</p>
<p>of what the status of CO2 is in their system?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, which doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no knowledge,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m unaware, but that&rsquo;s blissfully unaware.</p>
<p>I have not looked at that literature, so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I have a feeling, I mean, most people,</p>
<p>or excuse me, most of the scientific literature</p>
<p>around breathing in humans that I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>relates to these stressed states</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re a little bit easier to study in the lab,</p>
<p>whereas people feeling under-stimulated</p>
<p>or exhausted all the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a complicated thing to measure.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do it, but it&rsquo;s not as straightforward.</p>
<p>Well, CO2 is easy to measure.</p>
<p>But in terms of the sort of the measures</p>
<p>for feeling fatigue, they&rsquo;re somewhat indirect,</p>
<p>whereas stress, we can get at pulse rates in HRV</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Well, I imagine that these devices that we&rsquo;re all wearing</p>
<p>will soon be able to measure,</p>
<p>well, now they can measure oxygen levels,</p>
<p>oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>Which is amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but oxygens will pretty much stay</p>
<p>above 90% unless there&rsquo;s some pathology</p>
<p>or you go to altitude.</p>
<p>But CO2 levels vary quite a bit.</p>
<p>And in fact, because they vary, your body is so sensitive,</p>
<p>the control of breathing,</p>
<p>like how much you breathe per minute,</p>
<p>is determined in a very sensitive way by the CO2 level.</p>
<p>So even a small change in your CO2</p>
<p>will have a significant effect on your ventilation.</p>
<p>So this is another thing that not only changes</p>
<p>your ventilation, but affects your brain state.</p>
<p>Now, another thing that could affect</p>
<p>how breathing practice can affect your emotional state</p>
<p>is simply the descending command.</p>
<p>Because breathing practice involves</p>
<p>volitional control of your breathing.</p>
<p>And therefore, there&rsquo;s a signal that&rsquo;s originating</p>
<p>somewhere in your motor cortex.</p>
<p>That is not, of course, that&rsquo;s gonna go down</p>
<p>to pre-Butzinger.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also gonna send off collaterals to other places.</p>
<p>Those collaterals could obviously influence</p>
<p>your emotional state.</p>
<p>So we have quite a few different potential sources.</p>
<p>None of them that are exclusive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting paper which shows</p>
<p>that if you block nasal breathing,</p>
<p>you still see breathing-related oscillations in the brain.</p>
<p>And this is where I think the mechanism is occurring,</p>
<p>is that these breathing-related oscillations in the brain,</p>
<p>they are playing a role in signal processing.</p>
<p>And maybe, should I talk a little bit about the role</p>
<p>that oscillations may be playing in signal processing?</p>
<p>Definitely, but before you do,</p>
<p>I just want to ask you a intermediate question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about inhalation,</p>
<p>inspiration, and exhalation.</p>
<p>What about breath holds?</p>
<p>You know, in apnea, for instance,</p>
<p>people are holding their breath,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s conscious or unconscious,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re holding their breath.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s known about breath holds in terms of how</p>
<p>it might interact with brain state or oxygen, CO2?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m particularly interested in how breath holds</p>
<p>with lungs empty versus breath holds with lungs full</p>
<p>might differ in terms of their impact on the brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any studies on this,</p>
<p>looking at a mechanistic level,</p>
<p>but I find it really interesting.</p>
<p>And even if there are no studies,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love it if you&rsquo;d care to speculate.</p>
<p>Well, one of the breath practices that intrigue me</p>
<p>is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute</p>
<p>and then hold your breath for as long as you can.</p>
<p>Tummo style, Wim Hof style.</p>
<p>We call it in the laboratory,</p>
<p>because frankly, before Tummo and before Wim,</p>
<p>it was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically,</p>
<p>followed by a breath hold.</p>
<p>And that breath hold could be done</p>
<p>with lungs full or lungs empty.</p>
<p>So I had a long talk with some colleagues</p>
<p>about what they might think the underlying mechanisms are,</p>
<p>particularly for the breath hold.</p>
<p>And I certainly envision that there&rsquo;s a component</p>
<p>with respect to the presence or absence of that rhythmicity</p>
<p>in your cortex, which is having effect.</p>
<p>But the other thing with the hyperventilation,</p>
<p>hypoventilation or the apnea,</p>
<p>is your CO2 levels are going from low to high.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re holding your breath.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re holding your breath, okay.</p>
<p>And those are gonna have a profound influence.</p>
<p>Now, I have to talk about episodic hypoxia.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of work going on,</p>
<p>particularly with Gordon Mitchell</p>
<p>at the University of Florida,</p>
<p>is doing some extraordinary work on episodic hypoxia.</p>
<p>So in the 80s, David Milhorn</p>
<p>did some really intriguing work.</p>
<p>If I ask you to hold your breath, excuse me,</p>
<p>if I gave you a low oxygen mixture for a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>your breathing level would go up.</p>
<p>Because you wanna have more oxygen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starving for air.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re starving for oxygen.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And for a couple of minutes, you go up,</p>
<p>you can reach some steady state level.</p>
<p>Not so hypoxic that you can&rsquo;t reach an equilibrium.</p>
<p>And then I give you room air again,</p>
<p>your ventilation quickly relaxes back down to normal.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, I gave you three minutes of hypoxia,</p>
<p>five minutes of normoxia,</p>
<p>three minutes of hypoxia,</p>
<p>five minutes of normoxia,</p>
<p>three minutes hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia.</p>
<p>Normoxia being normal.</p>
<p>Normal, normal air.</p>
<p>Your ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.</p>
<p>After the last episode,</p>
<p>your breathing comes down</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t continue to come down,</p>
<p>but rises again and stays up for hours.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is well validated now.</p>
<p>This was originally done in animals,</p>
<p>but in humans all the time.</p>
<p>It seems to have profound benefit</p>
<p>on motor function and cognitive function.</p>
<p>In what direction?</p>
<p>Positive, positive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often toyed with the idea of getting a 5%,</p>
<p>an 8% oxygen.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do this listeners.</p>
<p>Getting an 8% oxygen tank by my desk</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m writing a grant</p>
<p>and doing like in blue velvet</p>
<p>and going through the episodic hypoxia</p>
<p>to improve my cognitive function.</p>
<p>I certainly could use improvement when I&rsquo;m writing grants.</p>
<p>But you could do this without the low oxygen.</p>
<p>I mean, you could do this through breath work, presumably.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to lower your oxygen enough.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going in the experimental studies,</p>
<p>they typically use 8% oxygen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to hold your breath long enough.</p>
<p>And there is another difference here.</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s happening to your CO2 levels.</p>
<p>When you hold your breath,</p>
<p>your oxygen levels are dropping,</p>
<p>your CO2 levels are going up.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing episodic hypoxia,</p>
<p>your CO2 levels are going to stay pretty normal.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re still breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the oxygen levels are gone.</p>
<p>So unlike normal conditions,</p>
<p>which you described before</p>
<p>where oxygen is relatively constant</p>
<p>and CO2 is fluctuating depending on emotional state</p>
<p>and activity and things of that sort,</p>
<p>in episodic hypoxia, CO2 is relatively constant,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re varying the oxygen level</p>
<p>coming into the system quite a bit.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s relatively,</p>
<p>I would say CO2 is relatively constant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to go in a direction</p>
<p>which is going to be significantly far from normal.</p>
<p>Whereas when you&rsquo;re holding your breath,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to become both hypoxic</p>
<p>and hypercapnic at the same time.</p>
<p>We should explain to people</p>
<p>what hypoxic and hypercapnic are</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>Hypoxic is just a technical term</p>
<p>for low levels of oxygen.</p>
<p>Hyper, or you could say hypoxic, low.</p>
<p>Hyper is high, so hyperoxia,</p>
<p>or hypocapnia, low CO2,</p>
<p>or hypercapnia, highest levels of CO2.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re in episodic hypoxia,</p>
<p>if anything, you&rsquo;re going to become hypocapnic,</p>
<p>not hypercapnic,</p>
<p>and that could play an influence on this.</p>
<p>One example that I remember,</p>
<p>and Gordon will have to forgive me</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m misquoting this,</p>
<p>is they had a patient who had a stroke</p>
<p>and had weakness in ankle flexion.</p>
<p>That is, excuse me, ankle extension,</p>
<p>to extend the ankle.</p>
<p>And so they had the patient in a seat</p>
<p>where they could measure ankle extension,</p>
<p>and then they measured it,</p>
<p>and then they exposed the patient</p>
<p>to episodic hypoxia,</p>
<p>and they measured, again,</p>
<p>the strength of the ankle extension</p>
<p>when way up.</p>
<p>And so Gordon is looking at this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking at this now</p>
<p>for spinal cord rehab.</p>
<p>And I imagine for all sorts</p>
<p>of neuromuscular performance,</p>
<p>it could be beneficial.</p>
<p>Gordon is looking into athletic performance.</p>
<p>We have a project,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t been able</p>
<p>to push to the next level,</p>
<p>to do golf.</p>
<p>So I think-</p>
<p>Why golf?</p>
<p>Because you love golf.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s motor performance,</p>
<p>coordination, so it&rsquo;s not simply</p>
<p>running as fast as you can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coordination, it&rsquo;s concentration,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a whole variety of things.</p>
<p>And so the idea would be</p>
<p>to get a group of golfers</p>
<p>and give them their placebo controls.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;re breathing</p>
<p>a gas mixture,</p>
<p>which is just normal air,</p>
<p>or hypoxic gas mixture,</p>
<p>although they may be able</p>
<p>to figure it out based on their response.</p>
<p>Do it under controlled circumstances</p>
<p>that do it into a net,</p>
<p>measure their length of their drives,</p>
<p>their dispersion and whatnot,</p>
<p>and see what happens.</p>
<p>Look, if we could find</p>
<p>that this works for golfers,</p>
<p>forget about cognitive function,</p>
<p>we could sell this</p>
<p>for unbelievable amounts of money.</p>
<p>That sounds like a terrible idea.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not serious</p>
<p>about selling it, but-</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re joking.</p>
<p>Maybe people should know</p>
<p>that you are joking about that.</p>
<p>No, I think that anything</p>
<p>that can improve cognitive</p>
<p>and neuromuscular performance</p>
<p>is going to be of interest</p>
<p>for a wide range of both pathologic states</p>
<p>like injury, TBI, et cetera.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent questions I get</p>
<p>is about recovery from concussion</p>
<p>or traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>A lot of people think sports,</p>
<p>they think football,</p>
<p>they think rugby,</p>
<p>they think hockey,</p>
<p>but if you look at the statistics</p>
<p>on traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>most of it is construction workers,</p>
<p>car crashes, bicycle accidents.</p>
<p>I mean, the sports part of it</p>
<p>is a tiny, tiny minuscule fraction</p>
<p>of the total amount</p>
<p>of traumatic brain injury out there.</p>
<p>I think these protocols tested</p>
<p>in the context of golf</p>
<p>would be very interesting</p>
<p>because of the constraints</p>
<p>of the measures, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>and it could be exported</p>
<p>to a number of things.</p>
<p>I want to just try and imagine</p>
<p>whether or not there is any kind</p>
<p>of breathing pattern or breath work,</p>
<p>just to be direct about it,</p>
<p>that even partially mimics</p>
<p>what you described</p>
<p>in terms of episodic hypoxia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of Tumor-Wim Hof</p>
<p>cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before.</p>
<p>My lab studies this in humans,</p>
<p>and what we find is that</p>
<p>if people do cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>so for about a minute,</p>
<p>then exhale, hold their breath</p>
<p>for 15 to 60 seconds,</p>
<p>depending on what they can do,</p>
<p>and just keep repeating</p>
<p>that for about five minutes,</p>
<p>it seems to me that it at least</p>
<p>partially mimics the state</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>because afterwards,</p>
<p>people report heightened levels</p>
<p>of alertness, lower levels</p>
<p>of kind of triggering</p>
<p>due to stressful events.</p>
<p>They feel comfortable</p>
<p>at a higher level</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal, cognitive focus,</p>
<p>a number of improvements</p>
<p>that are pretty impressive</p>
<p>that any practitioner</p>
<p>of Wim Hof or Tumor</p>
<p>will be familiar with.</p>
<p>Is that pattern of breathing even,</p>
<p>can we say that it maps</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>in some general sense?</p>
<p>Well, the expert in this</p>
<p>would be Gordon Mitchell.</p>
<p>I would say it moves</p>
<p>in that direction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as extreme</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you can get down</p>
<p>to the levels of hypoxia</p>
<p>that they do clinically.</p>
<p>I know that our pals</p>
<p>at our Breath Collective</p>
<p>actually just bought a machine</p>
<p>because you can buy a machine</p>
<p>that does this.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And they bought it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>their own self-testing</p>
<p>to see whether or not</p>
<p>this has any effect</p>
<p>on anything that they can measure.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to be concerned</p>
<p>about self-experimentation,</p>
<p>but I applaud their curiosity</p>
<p>in going after it.</p>
<p>Hyperbaric chambers.</p>
<p>I hear a lot nowadays</p>
<p>about hyperbaric chambers.</p>
<p>People are buying them</p>
<p>and using them.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts</p>
<p>on hyperbaric chambers</p>
<p>as it relates to any of the-</p>
<p>Hyper or hypo?</p>
<p>Hyperbaric chambers.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about altitude?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have much to say.</p>
<p>I mean, your oxygen levels</p>
<p>will probably go up a little bit</p>
<p>and that could have</p>
<p>a beneficial effect,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s way outside</p>
<p>my area of comfort.</p>
<p>I think 2022,</p>
<p>I think is going to be</p>
<p>the year of two things</p>
<p>I keep hearing a lot about,</p>
<p>which is the deliberate use</p>
<p>of high salt intake</p>
<p>for performance,</p>
<p>increasing blood volume, et cetera,</p>
<p>and hyperbaric chambers</p>
<p>seem to be catching on</p>
<p>much in the same way</p>
<p>that ice baths were</p>
<p>and saunas seem to be right now.</p>
<p>But anyway, a prediction</p>
<p>we can return to at some point.</p>
<p>I want to ask you about</p>
<p>some of the studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen out there</p>
<p>exploring how deliberately</p>
<p>restricting one&rsquo;s breathing</p>
<p>to nasal breathing</p>
<p>can do things like improve memory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of papers</p>
<p>in Journal of Neuroscience,</p>
<p>which is a respectable journal</p>
<p>in our field.</p>
<p>One looking at olfactory memory.</p>
<p>So that kind of made sense</p>
<p>because you can smell things</p>
<p>better through your nose</p>
<p>than your mouth,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re some sort of elk</p>
<p>or something where they can,</p>
<p>presumably they have</p>
<p>some sense of smell</p>
<p>in their mouth as well.</p>
<p>But humans generally smell</p>
<p>with their nose.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t terribly surprising,</p>
<p>but there was a companion study</p>
<p>that showed that the hippocampus,</p>
<p>an area involved in encoding memories</p>
<p>in one form or another,</p>
<p>was more active, if you will,</p>
<p>and memory and recall</p>
<p>was better when people</p>
<p>learned information</p>
<p>while nasal breathing</p>
<p>as opposed to mouth breathing.</p>
<p>Does that make sense</p>
<p>from any mechanistic perspective?</p>
<p>Well, given that there are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a major pathway</p>
<p>going from the olfactory system</p>
<p>into the brain,</p>
<p>and you cut that,</p>
<p>and not one from any receptors</p>
<p>in the mouth,</p>
<p>the degree of respiratory modulation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>throughout the forebrain</p>
<p>is going to be less</p>
<p>with mouth breathing</p>
<p>than nose breathing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s certainly plausible.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of experiments</p>
<p>that need to be done</p>
<p>to distinguish between</p>
<p>the two that is the nasal component</p>
<p>and the non-nasal component</p>
<p>of these breathing-related signals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tendency sometimes</p>
<p>when you have a strong effect</p>
<p>to be exclusive,</p>
<p>and I think what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>is that there are many inputs</p>
<p>that can have an effect.</p>
<p>Now, whether they&rsquo;re parceled,</p>
<p>that some affect this part of behavior</p>
<p>and some affect that part of behavior</p>
<p>remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly a strong olfactory component,</p>
<p>my interest is trying to follow</p>
<p>the central component</p>
<p>because we know that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a strong central component in this.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a strong central projection</p>
<p>to the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>So regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any air flowing in and out of the nose,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a respiratory input</p>
<p>into the olfactory bulb,</p>
<p>which combines with the respiratory</p>
<p>modulated signals coming</p>
<p>from the sensory receptors.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And as long as we are poking around,</p>
<p>forgive the pun, the nose,</p>
<p>what about one nostril versus the other nostril?</p>
<p>I know it sounds a little crazy to imagine,</p>
<p>but there have been theories in yoga traditions</p>
<p>and others that breathing through one nostril</p>
<p>somehow activates certain brain centers,</p>
<p>maybe hemispherically,</p>
<p>one side of the brain versus the other,</p>
<p>or that right nostril and left nostril breathing</p>
<p>might differ in terms of the levels</p>
<p>of alertness or calmness they produce.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any mechanistic data on that,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s anything worthwhile</p>
<p>about right nostril versus left nostril breathing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re aware of, I&rsquo;d love to know.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s certainly plausible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any data demonstrating it</p>
<p>except the anecdotal reports.</p>
<p>As you know, the brain is highly lateralized</p>
<p>and we have speech on one side</p>
<p>and a dominant hand is on one side.</p>
<p>And so the notion that if you have this huge signal</p>
<p>coming from the olfactory system</p>
<p>and to some degree it&rsquo;s lateralized,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not perfectly symmetrical,</p>
<p>that is, one side is not going evenly to both sides,</p>
<p>then you can imagine that once the signal gets distributed</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not uniform,</p>
<p>that the effectiveness or the response</p>
<p>is gonna be particular to the cortex</p>
<p>in which either the signal still remains</p>
<p>or the signal is removed from.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>What are some of the other features of our brain and body,</p>
<p>be it blinking or eye movements</p>
<p>or ability to encode sounds</p>
<p>or any features of the way that we function</p>
<p>and move and perceive things</p>
<p>that are coordinated with breathing</p>
<p>in some interesting way?</p>
<p>Thank you for that question.</p>
<p>Almost everything.</p>
<p>So we have, for example, on the autonomic side,</p>
<p>we have respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</p>
<p>That is, during expiration, the heart slows down.</p>
<p>Your pupils oscillate with the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the functional basis for that is,</p>
<p>but they do oscillate with the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p>When we inhale, our pupils constrict presumably</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an increase in heart rate</p>
<p>and sympathetic tone.</p>
<p>I would think of constriction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing as you relax, the pupil will get,</p>
<p>and you exhale, the pupil will get-</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, but I always get the valence of that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s counterintuitive</p>
<p>because people wouldn&rsquo;t think that when the pupils get,</p>
<p>I mean, it depends.</p>
<p>I mean, you can get very alert and aroused</p>
<p>for stress or for good reasons,</p>
<p>and the pupils get wider, but your visual field narrows,</p>
<p>and then the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess the idea is</p>
<p>that the pupils are changing size,</p>
<p>and therefore the aperture of your visual window</p>
<p>is changing in coordination with breathing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Your fear response changes with the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p>Tell us more about that.</p>
<p>Well, it was a paper by Zolano,</p>
<p>which I think showed rather clearly</p>
<p>that if you show individuals fearful faces,</p>
<p>that their measured response of fearfulness</p>
<p>changes between inspiration and expiration.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know why, but it does.</p>
<p>Your reaction time changes.</p>
<p>So you talk about blinking.</p>
<p>The reaction time changes</p>
<p>between inspiration and expiration.</p>
<p>If I ask you to punch something,</p>
<p>the time will change between inspiration and expiration.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t know the degree</p>
<p>to which martial artists exploit that.</p>
<p>You know, you watch the breathing pattern,</p>
<p>and your opponent will actually move slower</p>
<p>during one cycle compared to the other.</p>
<p>Meaning, in which direction?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re exhaling, they can punch faster?</p>
<p>I have to say, I don&rsquo;t keep a table</p>
<p>of which direction things move in</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m out of the martial arts field now.</p>
<p>My vague understanding is that exhales on strikes</p>
<p>is the more typical way to do that.</p>
<p>And so as people strike, they exhale.</p>
<p>In many martial arts-</p>
<p>No, as you exhale.</p>
<p>But there are other components to striking</p>
<p>because you want to stiffen your rib cage,</p>
<p>you want to make a Valsalva maneuver.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s both an inspiration and an expiration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the same time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know enough about,</p>
<p>when you say during expiration,</p>
<p>I would assume that when you&rsquo;re making a strike,</p>
<p>you actually sort of want to stiffen here,</p>
<p>which is a Valsalva-like maneuver.</p>
<p>And oftentimes, they&rsquo;ll clinch their fist</p>
<p>at the last moment.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s a whole set of motor things there</p>
<p>that we can talk to some fighters.</p>
<p>We know people who know fighters, so we can ask them.</p>
<p>Interesting, what are some other things</p>
<p>that are modulated by breathing?</p>
<p>I think anything anyone looks at</p>
<p>seems to have a breathing component</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all over your brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to imagine it not being effective.</p>
<p>Now, whether it&rsquo;s incidental or just background</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t really have any behavioral advantage</p>
<p>is possible.</p>
<p>In other cases, it might have a behavioral advantage.</p>
<p>I mean, the big eye-opening thing for me,</p>
<p>probably a decade ago, was digging into literature</p>
<p>and seeing how much of cortical activity</p>
<p>and subcortical activity</p>
<p>had a respiratory modulated component to it.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of my colleagues</p>
<p>who are studying cortex are oblivious to this.</p>
<p>And they find, I heard a talk the other day</p>
<p>with a person who had gone unnamed,</p>
<p>who find a lot of things correlated</p>
<p>with a particular movement.</p>
<p>And I think it all, when I looked, I said,</p>
<p>gee, that&rsquo;s a list of things that are respiratory modulated.</p>
<p>And rather than it being correlated</p>
<p>to the movement that we&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>I think the movement they were looking at</p>
<p>was modulated by breathing, as was everything else.</p>
<p>So there wasn&rsquo;t that the movement itself</p>
<p>was driving that correlation.</p>
<p>It was that they were all correlated to something else,</p>
<p>which is the breathing movement.</p>
<p>And whether or not that is a behaviorally relevant</p>
<p>or behaviorally something you can exploit, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I suspect you&rsquo;re right, that breathing is,</p>
<p>if not the foundational driver of many,</p>
<p>if not all of these things,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s at least one of the foundational drivers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the background, it&rsquo;s in the brain,</p>
<p>and oscillations play an important part in brain function.</p>
<p>And they vary in frequency from maybe 100 hertz</p>
<p>down to, well, we can get to circadian</p>
<p>and sort of monthly cycles.</p>
<p>But breathing occupies a rather unusual place in all that,</p>
<p>because, so let me talk about what people think</p>
<p>the oscillations are doing, particularly the faster ones.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re important in coordinating signals across neurons.</p>
<p>Just like in a computer, a computer steps.</p>
<p>So a computer knows when information is coming</p>
<p>from another part of a computer</p>
<p>that it was originated at a particular time.</p>
<p>And so that discrete step-by-step thing</p>
<p>is important in computer control.</p>
<p>Now, the brain is not a digital device,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an analog device.</p>
<p>But when I have a signal coming in my ear and my eye,</p>
<p>which is Andrew Huberman speaking,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking at his face, I see that as a whole,</p>
<p>but the signal is coming into different parts of my brain.</p>
<p>How do I unify that?</p>
<p>Well, my neurons are very sensitive to changes</p>
<p>in signals arriving by fractions of a millisecond.</p>
<p>So how do I assure that those signals coming in</p>
<p>represent the same signal?</p>
<p>Well, if I have throughout my brain an oscillation,</p>
<p>and the signals ride on that oscillation,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the peak of the oscillation,</p>
<p>I can then have a much better handle</p>
<p>on the relative timing and say,</p>
<p>those two signals came in at the same time,</p>
<p>they may relate to the same object,</p>
<p>and aha, I see you as one unified thing spouting,</p>
<p>you know, talking.</p>
<p>And so these oscillations come</p>
<p>in many different frequency ranges,</p>
<p>and are important in memory formation</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people pay much attention to breathing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s relatively slow to this,</p>
<p>the range when you think about milliseconds.</p>
<p>But we have important things</p>
<p>that are thought to be important in cognitive function,</p>
<p>which are a few cycles per second,</p>
<p>to 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second.</p>
<p>Breathing in humans is maybe 0.2 cycles per second,</p>
<p>every five seconds, although in rodents,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re up to four per second, which is pretty fast.</p>
<p>So, but breathing has one thing which is special,</p>
<p>that is, you can readily change it.</p>
<p>So the degree to which the brain</p>
<p>is using that slow signal for anything,</p>
<p>if that becomes part of its normal signal processing,</p>
<p>you now change it,</p>
<p>that signal processing has to change.</p>
<p>And as that signal processing changes,</p>
<p>acutely, there&rsquo;s a change.</p>
<p>So, you know, you asked about breath practice,</p>
<p>how long do you have to do it?</p>
<p>Well, a single breath will change your state.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re nervous, you take a deep breath,</p>
<p>and it seems to help relax, or even sigh.</p>
<p>Call it what you will.</p>
<p>Call it what you will.</p>
<p>It seems to work.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t have a permanent change,</p>
<p>but, you know, when I&rsquo;m getting up to bat,</p>
<p>or getting up to the first tee,</p>
<p>or getting to give a big talk,</p>
<p>or coming to do a podcast, get a little bit anxious,</p>
<p>a deep breath or a few deep breaths</p>
<p>are tremendously effective in calming one down.</p>
<p>And so, you can get a transient disruption,</p>
<p>but on the other hand,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take something like depression.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, you can envision depression</p>
<p>as activity sort of going around in a circuit.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s continuous in the nervous system,</p>
<p>as signals keep repeating, they tend to get stronger.</p>
<p>And they can get so strong, you can&rsquo;t break them.</p>
<p>So, you can imagine depression</p>
<p>being something going on and on and on,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t break it.</p>
<p>And so, we have trouble when we get</p>
<p>to certain levels of depression.</p>
<p>I mean, all of us get depressed at some point,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s not continuous, it&rsquo;s not long lasting,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to break it.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s long lasting and very deep, we can&rsquo;t break it.</p>
<p>So, the question is, how do we break it?</p>
<p>Well, there are extreme measures to break it.</p>
<p>We could do electroconvulsive shock.</p>
<p>We shock the whole brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s disrupting activity in the whole brain.</p>
<p>And when the circuit starts to get back together again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been disruptive.</p>
<p>And we know that the brain,</p>
<p>when signals get disrupted a little bit,</p>
<p>we can weaken the connections.</p>
<p>And weakening the connections,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s that in the circuit involved in depression,</p>
<p>we may get some relief.</p>
<p>And electroconvulsive shock does work</p>
<p>for relieving many kinds of depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty heroic.</p>
<p>Focal deep brain stimulation does the same thing,</p>
<p>but more localized or transcranial stimulation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re disrupting a network,</p>
<p>and while it&rsquo;s getting back together,</p>
<p>it may weaken some of the connections.</p>
<p>If breathing is playing some role in this circuit,</p>
<p>and now, instead of doing like a one-second shock,</p>
<p>I do 30 minutes of disruption by doing slow breathing</p>
<p>or other breathing practice,</p>
<p>those circuits begin to break down a little bit,</p>
<p>and I get some relief.</p>
<p>And if I continue to do it</p>
<p>before the circuit can then build back up again,</p>
<p>I gradually can wear that circuit down.</p>
<p>I sort of liken this,</p>
<p>I tell people it&rsquo;s like walking around on a dirt path.</p>
<p>You build a rut.</p>
<p>The rut gets so deep, you can&rsquo;t get out of it.</p>
<p>And what breathing is doing</p>
<p>is sort of filling in the rut bit by bit</p>
<p>to the point that you can climb out of that rut.</p>
<p>And that is because breathing,</p>
<p>the breathing signal is playing some role</p>
<p>in the way the circuit works.</p>
<p>And then when you disrupt it,</p>
<p>the circuit gets a little thrown off kilter.</p>
<p>And as you know, when circuits get thrown off,</p>
<p>the nervous system tries to adjust in some way or another.</p>
<p>And it turns out, at least for breathing,</p>
<p>for some evolutionary reason or just by happenstance,</p>
<p>it seems to improve our emotional function</p>
<p>or our cognitive function.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re very fortunate that that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrific segue into what I want to ask you next.</p>
<p>And this is part of a set of questions</p>
<p>I want to make sure we touch on before we wrap up,</p>
<p>which is what do you do with all this knowledge</p>
<p>in terms of a breathing practice?</p>
<p>You mentioned that one breath can shift your brain state</p>
<p>and that itself can be powerful.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also talked about 30-minute breathwork practices,</p>
<p>which is 30 minutes of breathwork</p>
<p>is a pretty serious commitment, I think, but it&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>Certainly a zero cost except for the time in most cases.</p>
<p>What do you see out there in the landscape of breathwork</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being done that you like?</p>
<p>And why do you like it?</p>
<p>What do you think you,</p>
<p>or what would you like to see more of</p>
<p>in terms of exploration of breathwork?</p>
<p>And what do you do?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a relatively new convert to breathwork.</p>
<p>Through my own investigation of it,</p>
<p>I became convinced that it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m basically a beginner in terms of my own practice.</p>
<p>And I like to keep things simple.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve discussed this before.</p>
<p>I liken it to someone who&rsquo;s a couch potato</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s told they got to begin to exercise.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go out and run a marathon.</p>
<p>So, you know, couch potato, you say,</p>
<p>okay, get up and walk for five minutes, then 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And then, okay, now you&rsquo;re walking for a longer period,</p>
<p>you begin to run.</p>
<p>And then you reach a point, you say,</p>
<p>well, gee, I&rsquo;m interested in this sport.</p>
<p>And there may be particular kinds of practices</p>
<p>that you can use that could be helpful</p>
<p>in optimizing performance of that sport.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not there yet.</p>
<p>I find I get tremendous benefit by relatively short periods</p>
<p>between five and maybe 20 minutes of doing box breathing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple to do.</p>
<p>I have a simple app, which helps me keep the timing.</p>
<p>Do you recall which app it is?</p>
<p>Is it the Apnea Trainer?</p>
<p>Is that the one?</p>
<p>Well, I was using Calm for a long time,</p>
<p>but I let my subscription relapse.</p>
<p>And I have another one whose name I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s very simple and it works for me.</p>
<p>Now trying this Tummo,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just curious and exploring it</p>
<p>because it may be acting for a different way.</p>
<p>And I wanna see if I respond differently.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have a particular point of view now.</p>
<p>I have friends and colleagues who are into,</p>
<p>you know, particular styles like Wim Hof.</p>
<p>And I think what he&rsquo;s doing is great</p>
<p>in getting people who are interested.</p>
<p>I think the notion is that I would like to see</p>
<p>more people exploring this.</p>
<p>And to some degree, as you point out, 30 minutes a day,</p>
<p>some of the breath patterns that some of these stars</p>
<p>like Wim Hof are a little intimidating to newbies.</p>
<p>And so I would like to see something very simple</p>
<p>that people, what I tell my friends is,</p>
<p>look, just try it five or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>See if you feel better, do it for a few days.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it, stop it, it doesn&rsquo;t cost anything.</p>
<p>And invariably they find that it&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>I will often interrupt my day</p>
<p>to take five or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Like if I find that I&rsquo;m lagging, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, I think there&rsquo;s some pretty good data</p>
<p>that your performance after lunch declines.</p>
<p>And so very often what I&rsquo;ll do after lunch,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t do today, is take five or 10 minutes</p>
<p>and just sort of breath practice.</p>
<p>And lately, what does that breath practice look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just box breathing for five or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And the duration of your inhales and holds and exhales</p>
<p>and holds is set by the app, is that right?</p>
<p>Well, I do five seconds.</p>
<p>So five seconds inhale, five second hold,</p>
<p>five second exhale, five second hold.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;ll do doubles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Just because I get bored, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, I feel like doing it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very helpful.</p>
<p>I mean, now that&rsquo;s not the only thing I do</p>
<p>with respect to trying to maintain my sanity and my health.</p>
<p>No, I can imagine that there&rsquo;d be a number of things.</p>
<p>Although you seem, because you seem very sane</p>
<p>and very healthy, I in fact know that you are.</p>
<p>Both of those things.</p>
<p>Well, you suspect that I am.</p>
<p>I suspect, but there&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>A while back, we had a conversation, a casual conversation,</p>
<p>but you said something that really stuck in my mind,</p>
<p>which is that it might be that the specific pattern</p>
<p>of breath work that one does is not as important</p>
<p>as experiencing transitions between states</p>
<p>based on deliberate breath work or something to that extent,</p>
<p>which I interpreted to mean that</p>
<p>if I were to do box breathing with five second in,</p>
<p>five second hold, five second exhale,</p>
<p>five second hold for a couple of days,</p>
<p>or maybe even a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>and then switch to 10 seconds, or then switch to TUMO,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something powerful, perhaps,</p>
<p>in the transitions and realizing the relationship</p>
<p>between different patterns of breathing</p>
<p>in those transitions, much in the same way</p>
<p>that you can get into one of these cars</p>
<p>at an amusement park that just goes at a constant rate</p>
<p>and then stops, very different than learning</p>
<p>how to shift gears, you know, I used to drive a manual,</p>
<p>I still can, so I&rsquo;m thinking about a manual transmission,</p>
<p>but even with an automatic transmission,</p>
<p>you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves</p>
<p>under different conditions,</p>
<p>and I thought that was a beautiful seed</p>
<p>for a potential breath work practice</p>
<p>that, at least to my awareness, nobody has really formalized</p>
<p>which is that you introduce some variability</p>
<p>within the practice that&rsquo;s somewhat random</p>
<p>in order to be able to sense the relationship</p>
<p>between different speeds and depths of inhales,</p>
<p>exhales, and holds, and so forth,</p>
<p>and essentially, it&rsquo;s like driving around the track,</p>
<p>but with obstacles at different rates,</p>
<p>and braking, and restarting, and things of that sort,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you learn how to drive.</p>
<p>What do you think about that, and if you like it enough,</p>
<p>can we call it the Feldman Protocol?</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>You know, I was asked in this BBC interview once,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t I name it the Feldman Complex,</p>
<p>instead of the Prebutzinger Complex?</p>
<p>You said I already have a Feldman Complex.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like a psychiatric disorder,</p>
<p>but I think the primary effect</p>
<p>is this disruptive effect, which I described,</p>
<p>but the particular responses may clearly vary</p>
<p>depending on what that disruption is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any particular data</p>
<p>which are some well-controlled experiments</p>
<p>which can actually work through</p>
<p>the different types of breathing patterns,</p>
<p>or simply with a box pattern, just varying the durations.</p>
<p>I mean, prayama is sort of similar,</p>
<p>but the amount of time you spend</p>
<p>going around the box is different.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really have much to say about this.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why we need</p>
<p>better controlled experiments in humans,</p>
<p>and I think this is where being able to study it in rodents,</p>
<p>where you can have a wide range of perturbations</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re doing more invasive studies</p>
<p>to really get down as to which regions are affected,</p>
<p>how is the signal processing disrupted,</p>
<p>which is still a hypothesis, but how it&rsquo;s disrupted</p>
<p>could tell us a lot about, you know,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a resonant point</p>
<p>at which there&rsquo;s an optimal effect</p>
<p>when you take a particular breathing practice.</p>
<p>And then when we talked about, you know,</p>
<p>the fact that different breathing practices</p>
<p>could be affecting the outcome through different pathways.</p>
<p>You know, you have the olfactory pathway,</p>
<p>you have a central pathway, you have a vagal pathway,</p>
<p>you have a descending pathway,</p>
<p>how different practices may change</p>
<p>the summation of those things,</p>
<p>because I think all those things are probably involved.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just beginning to scratch the surface.</p>
<p>And I just hope that we can get serious neuroscientists</p>
<p>and psychologists to do the right experiments</p>
<p>to get at this, because I think there&rsquo;s a lot of value</p>
<p>to human health here.</p>
<p>I do too, and it&rsquo;s one of the reasons my lab</p>
<p>has shifted to these sorts of things in humans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted that you&rsquo;re continuing to do</p>
<p>the hardcore mechanistic work in mice</p>
<p>and probably do work in humans as well,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not already.</p>
<p>And there are other groups, EPOL lab at UCSF,</p>
<p>and a number of, I&rsquo;m starting to see some papers out there</p>
<p>about respiration in humans a little bit,</p>
<p>some more brain imaging.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but ask about a somewhat unrelated topic,</p>
<p>but it is important in light of this conversation</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I really enjoy</p>
<p>about conversations with you,</p>
<p>as it relates to health and neuroscience and so forth,</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re one of the few colleagues I have</p>
<p>who openly admits to exploring supplementation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a long time supplement fan.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s power in compounds,</p>
<p>both prescription, non-prescription, natural, synthesized.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use these haphazardly,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s certainly power in them.</p>
<p>And one of the places where you and I converge</p>
<p>in terms of our interest in the nervous system</p>
<p>and supplementation is vis-a-vis magnesium.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve talked endlessly on the podcast and elsewhere</p>
<p>about magnesium for sake of sleep</p>
<p>and improving transitions to sleep and so forth.</p>
<p>But you have a somewhat different interest in magnesium</p>
<p>as it relates to cognitive function</p>
<p>and durability of cognitive function.</p>
<p>Would you mind just sharing with us a little bit</p>
<p>about what that interest is, where it stems from?</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>and we often talk about supplementation,</p>
<p>what you do with that information?</p>
<p>So I need to disclose that I am a scientific advisor</p>
<p>to a company called Neuroscentria,</p>
<p>which my graduate student, Guo-Sang Liu, is CEO.</p>
<p>So that said, I can give you some background.</p>
<p>Guo-Sang, although when he was in my lab,</p>
<p>worked on breathing,</p>
<p>had a deep interest in learning and memory.</p>
<p>And when he left my lab, he went to work</p>
<p>with a renowned learning and memory guy</p>
<p>at Stanford, Dick Chen.</p>
<p>And when he finished there,</p>
<p>he was hired by Susumu Tonogawa at MIT.</p>
<p>Who also knows a thing or two about memory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m teasing.</p>
<p>Susumu has a Nobel for his work on immunoglobulins,</p>
<p>but then is a world-class memory researcher.</p>
<p>And more.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s many things.</p>
<p>And Guo-Sang had very curious, very bright guy.</p>
<p>And he was interested in how signals</p>
<p>between neurons get strengthened,</p>
<p>which is called long-term potentiation or LTP.</p>
<p>And one of the questions that arose</p>
<p>was if I have inputs to a neuron,</p>
<p>and I get LTP,</p>
<p>is the LTP bigger if the signal is bigger,</p>
<p>or the noise is less?</p>
<p>So we can imagine that when we&rsquo;re listening to something,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s louder, we can hear it better.</p>
<p>Or if there&rsquo;s less noise, we can hear it better.</p>
<p>And he wanted to investigate this.</p>
<p>So he did this in tissue culture of hippocampal neurons.</p>
<p>And what he found was that if he</p>
<p>lowered the background activity in all of the neurons,</p>
<p>that the LTP he elicited got stronger.</p>
<p>And the way he did that was increasing</p>
<p>the level of magnesium in the bathing solution.</p>
<p>This gets into some esoteric electrophysiology.</p>
<p>But basically, there&rsquo;s a background level</p>
<p>of noise in all neurons.</p>
<p>And that part of it is regulated</p>
<p>by the degree of magnesium in the extracellular bath.</p>
<p>And you mean electrical noise.</p>
<p>Electrical noise, I&rsquo;m sorry, electrical noise.</p>
<p>And if you, in what&rsquo;s called the physiological range,</p>
<p>which is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar,</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t worry about the number.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I remember the millimolar of the magnesium.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always frightened that I get,</p>
<p>if I say micro or femto or something,</p>
<p>I go off by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>So in that physiological range,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference in the amount of noise</p>
<p>in a neuron between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar.</p>
<p>So he played around with the magnesium</p>
<p>and he found out that when the magnesium was elevated,</p>
<p>there was more LTP.</p>
<p>All right, that&rsquo;s an observation in a tissue culture.</p>
<p>Right, and I should just mention that more LTP</p>
<p>essentially translates to more neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>more rewiring of connections in essence.</p>
<p>So he tested this in mice</p>
<p>and basically he offered them a,</p>
<p>he had control mice, which got a normal diet</p>
<p>and one that had, one enriched with magnesium.</p>
<p>And the ones that lived enriched with magnesium</p>
<p>had higher cognitive function, lived longer,</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;d want in some magic pill,</p>
<p>those mice did that, excuse me, rats.</p>
<p>The problem was that you couldn&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>taking this into humans because most magnesium salts</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t passively get from the gut</p>
<p>into the bloodstream, into the brain.</p>
<p>They pass via a, what&rsquo;s called a transporter.</p>
<p>A transporter is something in a membrane</p>
<p>that grabs a magnesium molecule or atom</p>
<p>and pulls it into the other side.</p>
<p>So if you imagine you have magnesium in your gut,</p>
<p>you have transporters that pull the magnesium</p>
<p>into the gut, into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Well, if you had taken normal magnesium supplement</p>
<p>that you can buy at the pharmacy,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t cross the gut very easily.</p>
<p>And if you would take enough of it</p>
<p>to get it in your bloodstream, you start getting diarrhea.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a good way to go.</p>
<p>Well, it is a good way to go.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>Well said.</p>
<p>So he worked with this brilliant chemist, Fay Mao,</p>
<p>and Fay looked at a whole range of magnesium compounds</p>
<p>and he found that magnesium threonate</p>
<p>was much more effective in crossing the gut blood barrier.</p>
<p>Now, they didn&rsquo;t realize at the time,</p>
<p>but threonate is a metabolite of vitamin C.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of threonate in your body.</p>
<p>So magnesium threonate would appear to be safe</p>
<p>and maybe part of the role,</p>
<p>or now they believe it&rsquo;s part of the role of the threonate,</p>
<p>is that it supercharges the transporter</p>
<p>to get the magnesium in.</p>
<p>And remember, you need a transporter at the gut,</p>
<p>into the brain and into cells.</p>
<p>So they gave magnesium threonate to mice who had,</p>
<p>no, let me backtrack a bit.</p>
<p>They did a study in humans.</p>
<p>They hired a company to do a test.</p>
<p>It was a hands-off test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these companies that gets hired</p>
<p>by the big pharma to do their test for them.</p>
<p>And they got patients who were diagnosed</p>
<p>as mild cognitive decline.</p>
<p>These are people who had cognitive disorder,</p>
<p>which was age-inappropriate.</p>
<p>And the metric that they use</p>
<p>for determining how far off they were</p>
<p>is Spearman&rsquo;s g-factor,</p>
<p>which is a generalized measure of intelligence</p>
<p>that most psychologists accept.</p>
<p>And the biological age of the subjects was,</p>
<p>I think, 51.</p>
<p>And the cognitive age was 61</p>
<p>based on the Spearman g-test.</p>
<p>Oh, I should say, the Spearman g-factor</p>
<p>starts at a particular level in the population at age 20</p>
<p>and declines about 1% a year.</p>
<p>So sorry to say, we&rsquo;re not 20-year-olds anymore.</p>
<p>But when you get a number from that,</p>
<p>you can put on the curve</p>
<p>and see whether it&rsquo;s about your age or not.</p>
<p>These people were about 10 years older</p>
<p>according to that metric.</p>
<p>And long story short, after three months,</p>
<p>this was a placebo-controlled double-blind study.</p>
<p>The people who were in the placebo arm</p>
<p>improved two years,</p>
<p>which is common for human studies</p>
<p>to cause a placebo effect.</p>
<p>The people who got the compound</p>
<p>improved eight years on average.</p>
<p>And some improved more than eight years.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do any further diagnosis</p>
<p>as to what caused the mild cognitive decline.</p>
<p>But it was pretty, it was extraordinarily impressive.</p>
<p>So it moved their cognition closer to their biological age.</p>
<p>Biological age.</p>
<p>Do you recall what the doses of magnesium-3 and 8 were?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the paper,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically what they have in the compound</p>
<p>which is sold commercially.</p>
<p>So the compound which is sold commercially</p>
<p>is handled by a nutraceutical wholesaler</p>
<p>who sells it to the retailers,</p>
<p>and they make whatever formulation they want.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a dosage which is,</p>
<p>my understanding, is rarely tolerable.</p>
<p>I take half a dose.</p>
<p>The reason I take half a dose</p>
<p>is that I had my magnesium, blood magnesium measured,</p>
<p>and it was low normal for my age.</p>
<p>I took half a dose, it became high normal.</p>
<p>And I felt comfortable staying in the normal range.</p>
<p>But, you know, a lot of people are taking the full dose.</p>
<p>And at my age, I&rsquo;m not looking to get smarter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking to decline more slowly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell you</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s effective or not.</p>
<p>Well, you remembered the millimolar</p>
<p>of the magnesium in the solution,</p>
<p>and on the high and low end.</p>
<p>So I would say it&rsquo;s not a well-controlled study,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an N of one, but it seems to be working.</p>
<p>When I recommend it to my friends,</p>
<p>academics who are, by nature, skeptical, if not cynical,</p>
<p>and I insist that they try it,</p>
<p>they usually don&rsquo;t report a major change</p>
<p>in their cognitive function,</p>
<p>although sometimes they do report,</p>
<p>well, I feel a little bit more alert,</p>
<p>and my physical movements are better.</p>
<p>But many of them report they sleep better.</p>
<p>And that makes sense.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s good evidence that three and eight</p>
<p>can accelerate the transition into sleep,</p>
<p>and maybe even access to deeper modes of sleep.</p>
<p>For many people, actually,</p>
<p>a small percentage of people who take three and eight,</p>
<p>including one of our podcast staff here,</p>
<p>have stomach issues with it.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t tolerate it.</p>
<p>I would say, just anecdotally,</p>
<p>about 5% of people don&rsquo;t tolerate three and eight well.</p>
<p>You stop taking it, and then they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>It causes them diarrhea or something of that sort.</p>
<p>But most people tolerate it well,</p>
<p>and most people report that it vastly improves their sleep.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s anecdotally.</p>
<p>There are a few studies, and they&rsquo;re more on the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>because until you and I had the discussion</p>
<p>about three and eight,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the cognitive enhancing effects.</p>
<p>But the story makes sense from a mechanistic perspective.</p>
<p>And it brings it around</p>
<p>to a bigger and more important statement,</p>
<p>which is that I so appreciate your attention to mechanism.</p>
<p>I guess this stems from your early training as a physicist,</p>
<p>and the desire to get numbers,</p>
<p>and to really parse things at a fine level.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered a lot today.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s much more that we could cover.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to insist on a part two at some point,</p>
<p>but I really want to speak on behalf</p>
<p>of a huge number of people, and just thank you,</p>
<p>not just for your time and energy and attention</p>
<p>to detail and accuracy and clarity around this topic today,</p>
<p>but also what I should have said at the beginning,</p>
<p>which is that you really are a pioneer</p>
<p>in this field of studying respiration,</p>
<p>and the mechanisms underlying respiration</p>
<p>with modern tools now for many decades.</p>
<p>And the field of neuroscience was one</p>
<p>that was perfectly content to address issues</p>
<p>like memory and vision and sensation, perception, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the respiratory system was largely overlooked</p>
<p>for a long time,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve just been steadily clipping away</p>
<p>and clipping away,</p>
<p>much because of the events related to COVID</p>
<p>and a number of other things,</p>
<p>and this huge interest in breathwork</p>
<p>and brain states and wellness.</p>
<p>The field of respiration and interest in respiration</p>
<p>has just exploded.</p>
<p>So I really want to extend a sincere thanks.</p>
<p>It means a lot to me,</p>
<p>and I know to the audience of this podcast</p>
<p>that someone with your depth and rigor in this area</p>
<p>is both a scientist and a practitioner,</p>
<p>and that you would share this with us, so thank you.</p>
<p>Well, I want to thank you.</p>
<p>This is actually a great opportunity for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been isolated in my silo for a long time,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been a wonderful experience</p>
<p>to communicate to people outside the silo</p>
<p>who have an interest in this,</p>
<p>and I think that there&rsquo;s a lot that remains to be done,</p>
<p>and I enjoy speaking to people who have interest in this.</p>
<p>I find the interest to be quite mind-boggling,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite wonderful</p>
<p>that people are willing to listen to things</p>
<p>that can be quite esoteric at times,</p>
<p>but it gets down to deep things about who we are</p>
<p>and how we are going to live our lives.</p>
<p>So I appreciate the opportunity,</p>
<p>and I would be delighted to come back at any time.</p>
<p>Wonderful, we will absolutely do it.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Jack.</p>
