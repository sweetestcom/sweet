    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,</p>
<p>where I and an expert guest discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is the third in the six episode series</p>
<p>on fitness, exercise, and performance.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is all about endurance and fat loss.</p>
<p>That is the specific protocols required</p>
<p>to achieve the four different kinds of endurance</p>
<p>and how to maximize fat loss.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about endurance,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very interested in this conversation</p>
<p>because I, like many other people,</p>
<p>strive to get a certain amount</p>
<p>of cardiovascular work in each week,</p>
<p>maybe a longish jog, maybe a swim, ride the bike, et cetera.</p>
<p>But when I think about the word endurance,</p>
<p>the idea that almost immediately comes to mind</p>
<p>is about doing something for a long period of time,</p>
<p>repeatedly, but I have a feeling that there are other ways</p>
<p>to trigger this adaptation</p>
<p>that we call the endurance adaptation.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited to learn about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also excited to learn about the fuel systems</p>
<p>in the body that allow for endurance</p>
<p>and other modes of repeated activity.</p>
<p>So in order to kick things off,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to frame the conversation</p>
<p>by telling us what is endurance</p>
<p>and are there indeed a large variety of ways</p>
<p>to induce what we call this endurance adaptation?</p>
<p>Sure, the way I wanna start actually here</p>
<p>is calling back to some of the things we talked about</p>
<p>in our previous conversations,</p>
<p>which are really, people exercise for three reasons.</p>
<p>Number one, you wanna feel better.</p>
<p>Number two, you wanna look a certain way.</p>
<p>And then number three,</p>
<p>you wanna be able to do that for a long time, right?</p>
<p>So you need to, the way that we say it in sports</p>
<p>is look good, feel good, play good, right?</p>
<p>So I want some sort of functionality</p>
<p>to be able to perform a certain way,</p>
<p>whatever that is for you.</p>
<p>You wanna be able to look a certain way that,</p>
<p>whatever that matters for you,</p>
<p>and then you wanna be able to do that for a long time.</p>
<p>So when it comes to endurance,</p>
<p>we have a bunch of misnomers here,</p>
<p>which is the same thing with the strength training</p>
<p>or resistance exercise side,</p>
<p>where we wanted to dispel this myth that</p>
<p>I lift weights only because I wanna gain muscle</p>
<p>or play a sport.</p>
<p>And I wanna do cardio because I wanna either lose fat</p>
<p>or for long health sake.</p>
<p>And just like we smashed that myth</p>
<p>from the strength training side,</p>
<p>I wanna smash it from the endurance training side.</p>
<p>There are so many other reasons</p>
<p>that you wanna perform endurance training,</p>
<p>regardless of your goal, right?</p>
<p>Whether it is longevity, whether it is performance,</p>
<p>or whether it is aesthetics.</p>
<p>And so I wanna cover all those reasons,</p>
<p>exactly what to do, protocols of course,</p>
<p>and why those things are working that way.</p>
<p>In general though, the quick answer</p>
<p>is really endurance comes down to two independent factors.</p>
<p>Factor number one is fatigue management,</p>
<p>and then factor number two is fueling.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all it really comes down to.</p>
<p>So all the different types of training</p>
<p>are going to reach a limitation,</p>
<p>which are either again,</p>
<p>your ability to deal with some sort of fatigue,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s generally a fatigue signal.</p>
<p>The other one is managing some sort of restriction</p>
<p>of energy input.</p>
<p>And a lot of the, the spoiler here is,</p>
<p>a lot of the times people think it&rsquo;s a fueling issue</p>
<p>when really it&rsquo;s a fatigue management issue,</p>
<p>or the opposite.</p>
<p>And to have a complete health spectrum,</p>
<p>regardless of whether you&rsquo;re a high performance athlete,</p>
<p>like I typically deal with, or general public,</p>
<p>you need to be able to do both,</p>
<p>manage fatigue as well as understand fuel storage.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really what we&rsquo;re going to get into today.</p>
<p>Fantastic, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, I&rsquo;m going to ask you</p>
<p>what I often ask people who are expert</p>
<p>in their respective fields,</p>
<p>which is, is there any non-obvious tool or mechanism</p>
<p>or tool and mechanism that can allow people</p>
<p>to access better endurance?</p>
<p>You know, when I think about training for endurance,</p>
<p>again, I think about trying to run longer</p>
<p>and longer each week or swim further and further and so on.</p>
<p>But I do wonder whether or not there are other forms</p>
<p>of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation</p>
<p>that I or most people perhaps don&rsquo;t think of as endurance.</p>
<p>Sure, the way I want to answer this is,</p>
<p>if we look back and think about how we&rsquo;ve answered</p>
<p>that question with power and strength and force production,</p>
<p>it is really about how much can you produce maximally once.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re asking now is how can I repeat</p>
<p>that same quality of performance?</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, endurance really comes down</p>
<p>to your ability to maintain proper mechanics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to, like the biggest way</p>
<p>we can increase your endurance exponentially</p>
<p>very quickly is mechanical.</p>
<p>And this is starting with breathing.</p>
<p>And so we need to be breathing properly.</p>
<p>We need to have proper posture and positions,</p>
<p>and then we need to be moving well.</p>
<p>Efficiency is going to trump force always for endurance.</p>
<p>The other side of the equation is not that.</p>
<p>You can have a little bit of leaks in your mechanics</p>
<p>and still squat well or jump high and be fine</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to suffer</p>
<p>those consequences repeatedly, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to drain you over time.</p>
<p>So the quickest way to improve endurance</p>
<p>is to improve mechanics.</p>
<p>And the mechanical thing I would go after first</p>
<p>is your breathing techniques, your pattern,</p>
<p>your entire approach, as well as your posture.</p>
<p>And then from there,</p>
<p>the third one would be your movement technique.</p>
<p>Is it possible to describe the best way to breathe</p>
<p>when doing endurance training,</p>
<p>or is it far more complex than that?</p>
<p>And if it is far more complex than that,</p>
<p>then certainly we can get into it during today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is both of those.</p>
<p>I will give you a quick answer though.</p>
<p>A lot of the times you can kind of hit the cheat code,</p>
<p>which is nasal breathing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of times when you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to nasal breathe or don&rsquo;t need to nasal breathe,</p>
<p>but just, again, as like a one tool</p>
<p>that is a pretty general answer,</p>
<p>if you can do that,</p>
<p>a lot of the times that will fix breathing mechanics</p>
<p>just by default.</p>
<p>And we can maybe talk about why that is later,</p>
<p>but that would be my sort of one sentence</p>
<p>bullet point answer immediately</p>
<p>of how to get in the right position.</p>
<p>So second one would be simply looking at your posture,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re on a bike or you&rsquo;re doing a lift</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re literally hunched over</p>
<p>and your ribs are touching your femur</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re getting closer and closer,</p>
<p>like tends to happen on a bike or an air assault thing</p>
<p>for somebody I&rsquo;ve seen recently.</p>
<p>This morning I was on the assault bike doing a sprint</p>
<p>and I asked Andy, Dr. Galpin,</p>
<p>to critique my form and anything else he wanted to critique</p>
<p>so that I could improve.</p>
<p>And he did comment on my rather C-shaped posture.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Encouraged me to be more upright,</p>
<p>which I should probably do now as well.</p>
<p>And he also cued me to the fact</p>
<p>that during a one minute sprint,</p>
<p>there is something that is quote unquote magic</p>
<p>that happens right about the 40 second mark.</p>
<p>And I use that as a milestone to look for</p>
<p>and indeed something does happen at the 40 seconds</p>
<p>into a one minute sprint where all of a sudden</p>
<p>it does seem to get much easier</p>
<p>for reasons I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Maybe you can tell me that,</p>
<p>but it certainly had nothing to do with my posture.</p>
<p>My posture needs improvement.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, yeah.</p>
<p>So breathing mechanics and breathing strategies.</p>
<p>People tend to be over-breathing early on</p>
<p>and this is going to lead to problems later.</p>
<p>So having a more strategic breathing pattern</p>
<p>and approach is again, a very quick solution.</p>
<p>I know that we&rsquo;re going to dive very deep</p>
<p>into the mechanisms of energy and metabolism</p>
<p>and endurance today.</p>
<p>But as long as we&rsquo;re having a discussion</p>
<p>about these brief sort of tidbits</p>
<p>of how to improve endurance,</p>
<p>are there any other ways to improve endurance</p>
<p>that are of relatively short time investment,</p>
<p>even if they require a lot of energy?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The classic paradigm you&rsquo;re going to find here</p>
<p>is steady state long duration</p>
<p>posed up against what a lot of folks</p>
<p>will now call higher intensity</p>
<p>interval training specifically.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of misconceptions here.</p>
<p>The quick answer is you need to be doing both.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a bunch of stuff in between</p>
<p>that you should be practicing.</p>
<p>If you honestly want to maximize those three factors</p>
<p>we talked about at the beginning,</p>
<p>you need to be training across this full spectrum.</p>
<p>Just like I told you to train across the full spectrum</p>
<p>of your lifting,</p>
<p>we want to be doing the same thing here.</p>
<p>So are there independent special factors</p>
<p>that can happen with the shorter time length,</p>
<p>higher intensity stuff?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also magic that happens</p>
<p>on the other end of that spectrum.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t just choose one side</p>
<p>because what tends to happen is people either go with,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m going to do 30 or 45 minutes of steady state stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m going to do the opposite,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m going to leave that stuff on the table,</p>
<p>not do it,</p>
<p>because I only want to do high intensity intervals</p>
<p>because I can get it done in five minutes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s magic on both sides of the equation.</p>
<p>We want to get into all of that.</p>
<p>But just to answer your question directly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of things you can do</p>
<p>in under one minute that are convenient to do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a wonderful set of papers</p>
<p>out of a couple of laboratories in Canada</p>
<p>that championed this idea that&rsquo;s called exercise snacks.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a series of studies that have been done here</p>
<p>that are really interesting.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve looked at a couple of things</p>
<p>that are noteworthy.</p>
<p>One of them is a 20 second bout of all out work.</p>
<p>And this is actually done in workers in an office.</p>
<p>And so what they had them do is run upstairs.</p>
<p>And I believe it was about 60 steps is what it took them.</p>
<p>Something along the order of 20 seconds, exactly.</p>
<p>And they repeated that about once every four hours.</p>
<p>So really it&rsquo;s just, you go to work,</p>
<p>you get, you know,</p>
<p>put your coffee in your bag down, whatever.</p>
<p>You run up a flight of stairs,</p>
<p>20 seconds later,</p>
<p>then you go right back to work at lunch.</p>
<p>And before you go home,</p>
<p>you sort of repeat it there.</p>
<p>And if you repeat that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s multiple times a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do that.</p>
<p>I think they, in one of the interventions,</p>
<p>it was three times a week for six weeks,</p>
<p>18 total times you did that.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ll see is a noticeable improvement.</p>
<p>This is statistically significant improvements</p>
<p>in cardiorespiratory fitness,</p>
<p>specifically VO2 max,</p>
<p>as well as a number of cognitive benefits,</p>
<p>work productivity, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can happen in as little as 20 seconds.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go to the gym.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to shower.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do anything like that.</p>
<p>Just find the stairs,</p>
<p>run up and down them a few times.</p>
<p>Now you may have noticed,</p>
<p>you actually sort of caught me yesterday.</p>
<p>I did that right here, right?</p>
<p>I was just, I,</p>
<p>and we had a little bit of a break.</p>
<p>I was feeling an energy lull.</p>
<p>I ran up the stairs three or four times,</p>
<p>felt a lot better.</p>
<p>So that can actually also help.</p>
<p>They ran another study where they looked at that</p>
<p>following a giant high glycemic index meal.</p>
<p>And what they saw,</p>
<p>and then they took insulin measures</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of other biological markers associated</p>
<p>that you want to pay attention to</p>
<p>with the high glycemic index meal.</p>
<p>And they looked at those immediately</p>
<p>an hour, three hours, six hours as opposed.</p>
<p>And it was very clear that same intervention</p>
<p>was able to improve postplandial glucose control,</p>
<p>insulin, and a whole bunch of other factors</p>
<p>in addition to that.</p>
<p>So if you are the sort of type who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>wow, I&rsquo;m in an office all day,</p>
<p>maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal,</p>
<p>not the best approach,</p>
<p>but a little bit of mitigation there</p>
<p>can just be running up a flight of stairs</p>
<p>or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of magic and power in maximal exertion.</p>
<p>If one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work,</p>
<p>could they do jumping jacks?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, you could do anything you really wanted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the mode of exercise that matters here.</p>
<p>It is simply the exertion.</p>
<p>You just get up as hard as you can.</p>
<p>You could do burpees, you could do any number of things.</p>
<p>You can sprint down your road,</p>
<p>down the hallway, back and forth.</p>
<p>The mode is just something that was easy</p>
<p>for the scientists to control.</p>
<p>And X number of steps, people could do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna fall, hurt yourself, things like that.</p>
<p>Just to remind me, it&rsquo;s once every four hours,</p>
<p>one minute of all out.</p>
<p>20 seconds.</p>
<p>Oh, 20 seconds, excuse me.</p>
<p>20 seconds of essentially all out exertion</p>
<p>while remaining safe,</p>
<p>not going so fast up the stairs</p>
<p>or doing jumping jacks so fast.</p>
<p>And certainly not down the stairs.</p>
<p>Up the stairs, please.</p>
<p>Escalators don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose they count if you&rsquo;re moving,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not remaining on the same steps.</p>
<p>In fact, in an airport recently,</p>
<p>I saw somebody walking against the conveyor</p>
<p>while talking on the phone</p>
<p>while waiting for their flight to take off.</p>
<p>And I thought, it&rsquo;s genius, right?</p>
<p>It looked a little awkward.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it was-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked awkward in every airport</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in for the last 15 years</p>
<p>for these exact reasons, doing wild stuff like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, nothing&rsquo;s more awkward</p>
<p>than not being able to walk to the end of the terminal</p>
<p>simply because one isn&rsquo;t familiar</p>
<p>with walking that far carrying a couple of suitcases.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the other fit test.</p>
<p>The suitcase carrier in the airport.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>So once every four hours, 20 seconds.</p>
<p>So maybe once when arriving to work,</p>
<p>once four hours in and then four hours,</p>
<p>most people are probably at work somewhere,</p>
<p>plus or minus two hours.</p>
<p>Now, one thing I actually really want to make clear</p>
<p>because your audience is so incredible,</p>
<p>they tend to be really excited about these protocols</p>
<p>and they follow them exactly as written.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not exactly how science works.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be every four hours.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be three times a day.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be 20 seconds.</p>
<p>They literally built that protocol</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to replicate a real life scenario.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re in an office building.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re generally there for eight hours.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if you did one every sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>So if you want to do it four times a week, great.</p>
<p>If you can do it only 10 seconds, amazing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably going to get the same benefits.</p>
<p>Those are not the details to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The detail to pay attention to is every so often,</p>
<p>multiple times a day,</p>
<p>try to get your heart rate up really quickly.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t require sweating, doesn&rsquo;t require anything else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no warmup associated with it.</p>
<p>Again, you need a minute break</p>
<p>in between meetings or whatever,</p>
<p>and you can sprint up them.</p>
<p>I do this all the time in my house.</p>
<p>When you have those days</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on like seven straight hours of Zooms, et cetera,</p>
<p>you can get out of 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I run to my garage, which is over there.</p>
<p>I hop on the air bike and I will just smash out 30 seconds</p>
<p>as fast as I can and then walk right back in.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start.</p>
<p>Yeah, just also, you can just put one of those things,</p>
<p>which I do also, just put one in your office</p>
<p>and hop over out of there.</p>
<p>The whole entire thing now literally takes 23 seconds.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of our desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Momentus.</p>
<p>Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering</p>
<p>with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>their supplements are of extremely high quality.</p>
<p>Second of all,</p>
<p>their supplements are generally</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to develop a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to focus mainly</p>
<p>on using single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>With single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>you can devise the most logical and effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.</p>
<p>And this is of course important</p>
<p>because we realize that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>listeners reside outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try the various supplements mentioned</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>in particular supplements for hormone health,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Levels.</p>
<p>Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods</p>
<p>and activities affect your health</p>
<p>by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose</p>
<p>using a continuous glucose monitor.</p>
<p>Many people are aware that their blood sugar,</p>
<p>that is their blood glucose level,</p>
<p>is critical for everything from fat loss,</p>
<p>to muscle gain, to healthy cognition,</p>
<p>and indeed aging of the brain and body.</p>
<p>Most people do not know, however,</p>
<p>how different foods and different activities,</p>
<p>including exercise or different temperature environments,</p>
<p>impact their blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>And yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive</p>
<p>to all of those things.</p>
<p>I first started using Levels about a year ago</p>
<p>as a way to understand how different foods,</p>
<p>exercise, and timing of food relative to exercise,</p>
<p>and quality of sleep at night</p>
<p>impact my blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned a tremendous amount from using Levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taught me when best to eat, what best to eat,</p>
<p>when best to exercise, how best to exercise,</p>
<p>and how to modulate my entire schedule</p>
<p>from work to exercise and even my sleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about Levels</p>
<p>and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s levels.link slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that contains the exact ratios of the electrolytes,</p>
<p>sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>to optimize cellular functioning</p>
<p>for mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Most people realize that hydration is key.</p>
<p>We need to ingest enough fluids</p>
<p>in order to feel our best and perform our best.</p>
<p>But what most people do not realize</p>
<p>is that the proper functioning of our cells</p>
<p>and nerve cells, neurons in particular,</p>
<p>requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>be present in the correct ratios.</p>
<p>Now, of course, people with prehypertension</p>
<p>and hypertension need to be careful</p>
<p>about their sodium intake.</p>
<p>But what a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise,</p>
<p>and in particular, if you&rsquo;re following a very clean diet,</p>
<p>that is not a lot of processed foods,</p>
<p>which of course is a good thing,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re not getting enough sodium, potassium,</p>
<p>and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar.</p>

<p>So tell me about endurance.</p>
<p>What is endurance?</p>
<p>How do I get more endurance?</p>
<p>And how does it work?</p>
<p>When we think about endurance,</p>
<p>I would like to open up the conversation</p>
<p>to include more things than people generally do</p>
<p>when they hear the word endurance.</p>
<p>So, if we just think about</p>
<p>what you typically ask your body to do,</p>
<p>or would like to ask your body to do,</p>
<p>and we just walk through them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be things like this.</p>
<p>Number one, I wanna have energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a form of endurance.</p>
<p>Great, I don&rsquo;t wanna have these lulls and fatigue,</p>
<p>and I wanna feel fantastic</p>
<p>as I move throughout my activities of daily living,</p>
<p>whatever those may be.</p>
<p>Work, exercise, enjoyment, paying attention,</p>
<p>focus, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Great, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>Another thing you wanna ask your body to do</p>
<p>is I wanna be able to repeat some small effort</p>
<p>in a muscle group and feel great about that.</p>
<p>This is what we generally call muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So this is something like,</p>
<p>I wanna be able to walk up those 10 flights of steps,</p>
<p>and my quads aren&rsquo;t burning at the end of it, right?</p>
<p>Or it even gives me energy.</p>
<p>Another thing you&rsquo;ll wanna ask your body to do</p>
<p>is to be able to perform a tremendous amount of work</p>
<p>for a longer period of time,</p>
<p>something in the realm of 20 to 80 seconds.</p>
<p>So this could be something like if you&rsquo;re surfing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve gotta paddle extremely hard for a minute</p>
<p>to get on top of a wave,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re out riding your bike</p>
<p>and you need to be able to get up a hill</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very steep hill.</p>
<p>These are gonna take maximal efforts</p>
<p>for some small amount of time</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll get back up there.</p>
<p>We tend to call that maximum anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>So the max amount of work you can perform</p>
<p>at a high rate for some amount of seconds,</p>
<p>like maybe a minute.</p>
<p>Past that is your ability to repeat an effort</p>
<p>kind of like that for something like five to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And this is the example would be run a mile, right?</p>
<p>Some interval like that, which is a longer distance, right?</p>
<p>That is gonna be your maximum aerobic capacity.</p>
<p>Another thing you&rsquo;re gonna want your body to do</p>
<p>is what we call sustained position.</p>
<p>So this is, you wanna be able to sit in your chair at work</p>
<p>and have perfect posture for 20, 30, 40 minutes, right?</p>
<p>You wanna be able to stand in line at a grocery store</p>
<p>for 15 minutes and not have a breakdown in posture.</p>
<p>So you wanna be able to maintain position</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re riding your bike, you&rsquo;re not collapsing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing any of these activities</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get hurt or lose efficiency</p>
<p>simply because you couldn&rsquo;t sustain basic positions.</p>
<p>All right, whatever those shapes and positions need to be.</p>
<p>And then the last one is a maximum distance.</p>
<p>So you wanna be able to go for a longer hike</p>
<p>or have just a long day at Disneyland</p>
<p>for whatever it needs to be</p>
<p>and feel great at the end of it, right?</p>
<p>So the goal with all of these things</p>
<p>is not can you just do them, but can you do them</p>
<p>and then you feel good afterwards?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re back in a right position</p>
<p>where they give you energy, you feel good about it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just something you had to do</p>
<p>and you regretted and you felt awful.</p>
<p>So those are the factors I think about</p>
<p>when someone says, I want better endurance</p>
<p>is I wanna walk backwards and say,</p>
<p>okay, when you say endurance, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s generally the things I&rsquo;ve come across</p>
<p>is if you can handle all of those things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you&rsquo;re in fantastic shape.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna feel your recovery is going to be excellent</p>
<p>and your physical performance in the gym</p>
<p>or in any of the sporting activities you do</p>
<p>will be enhanced.</p>
<p>Given what you told us a little bit earlier</p>
<p>that endurance really reflects fatigue management</p>
<p>and energy production,</p>
<p>how do each and both of those things</p>
<p>relate to endurance at a mechanistic level?</p>
<p>I mean, really what I&rsquo;m asking is</p>
<p>what is fatigue management</p>
<p>and what is energy production?</p>
<p>In order to do that, it&rsquo;s important that we understand</p>
<p>all of those functional capacities that I just talked about.</p>
<p>They all have different points of failure, okay?</p>
<p>So in order to then work backwards and say,</p>
<p>well, how do I optimize my performance</p>
<p>in all those categories?</p>
<p>We need to go through each one and figure out,</p>
<p>well, where am I failing?</p>
<p>Some of them are gonna be failing</p>
<p>because of fatigue management</p>
<p>and some of them will be failing</p>
<p>because of energy production issues.</p>
<p>So if we walk through a little bit of how we make energy</p>
<p>and how we handle fatigue,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re gonna have a better understanding</p>
<p>of exactly what to do for each one of these categories</p>
<p>if you feel like one of them in particular</p>
<p>is worse for you or lagging behind,</p>
<p>or if in general you just wanna improve all of them.</p>
<p>All right, now I&rsquo;m gonna make a little bit</p>
<p>of a 90 degree turn here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it with strategy though, I promise.</p>
<p>And I wanna ask you a very simple question.</p>
<p>How do you lose weight?</p>
<p>I was taught that the calories in, calories out,</p>
<p>thermodynamics of energy utilization</p>
<p>governs most everything.</p>
<p>That is if I&rsquo;m ingesting less caloric energy than I burn,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to lose weight.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m ingesting exactly as much as I burn,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll maintain weight.</p>
<p>And if I ingest more than I burn, then I&rsquo;ll gain weight.</p>
<p>Sure, that is the approach you would take.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m asking really is</p>
<p>how are you actually physically losing the weight?</p>
<p>So my understanding is that we have</p>
<p>different fuel sources in the body.</p>
<p>Glycogen, which is stored in muscle and liver,</p>
<p>body fat, which is stored in mainly white adipose tissue,</p>
<p>and which is subcutaneous and around our organs,</p>
<p>intravisceral fat,</p>
<p>and that we can also use protein as a fuel.</p>
<p>And then as I recall,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a phosphocreatine system.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re going to tell me</p>
<p>that each of these systems is tapped into</p>
<p>on different timescales,</p>
<p>and perhaps according to different levels of exertion.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certain that what I just said is not exhaustive,</p>
<p>but hopefully it is most or entirely correct.</p>
<p>Pretty correct.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that got to do with fat loss?</p>
<p>At some point, body fat stores adipocytes, fat cells,</p>
<p>are going to start liberating fat as a fuel source.</p>
<p>And the stimulus for that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming is going to be that other fuel sources</p>
<p>are either depleted</p>
<p>or that the energy and metabolic systems of the body,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say decide</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have their own consciousness,</p>
<p>but are flipped-</p>
<p>Signaled.</p>
<p>Are signaling in a way that registers</p>
<p>that body fat would be the optimal fuel source</p>
<p>given how long and or intensely</p>
<p>a given activity has been performed.</p>
<p>Okay, we have some stuff to clean up there,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re still not really answering the question.</p>
<p>How am I actually losing that body fat?</p>
<p>How is it actually leaving the body?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>My understanding is that</p>
<p>it leaves the body through respiration.</p>
<p>Aha.</p>
<p>So now we have some interesting things to talk about.</p>
<p>How am I actually losing fat via respiration?</p>
<p>What the hell does that even mean?</p>
<p>How is something that occupied this physical space</p>
<p>on the side of me, leaving my body through my mouth?</p>
<p>And there is a very clear answer there, right?</p>
<p>Which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re cued up to.</p>
<p>When you take a breath in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re generally breathing in oxygen, O2.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other things, but we&rsquo;ll just stick to oxygen.</p>
<p>When you exhale, you&rsquo;re breathing out CO2.</p>
<p>The difference between those two is that carbon molecule.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that&rsquo;s important to understand here</p>
<p>is all of your carbohydrates,</p>
<p>which is that word itself is a carbon</p>
<p>that has been hydrated.</p>
<p>So it is a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule.</p>
<p>It is a simple chain of carbons.</p>
<p>Your fat molecules are also chains of carbon.</p>
<p>All of metabolism really, in terms of energy production,</p>
<p>is simply trying to figure out a way</p>
<p>to break those carbon bonds.</p>
<p>As a result, we get energy from that.</p>
<p>We use that energy to create a molecule called ATP,</p>
<p>which is the central source of energy for any living being.</p>
<p>That carbon is then floating around in free form,</p>
<p>which is bad news internally.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got to figure out a way</p>
<p>to get that carbon out of our system.</p>
<p>So all of energy production, all of fatigue management</p>
<p>really comes down to this core issue</p>
<p>of how are we handling carbon</p>
<p>and how are we moving it around the body?</p>
<p>And so what we do is we do this sneaky thing.</p>
<p>So another question I like to ask people</p>
<p>is why do we breathe?</p>
<p>Well, for two reasons,</p>
<p>to bring oxygen into the system</p>
<p>and to offload carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>But the neural trigger for breathing</p>
<p>is when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level</p>
<p>in the set of neurons in the brainstem</p>
<p>and elsewhere activate the phrenic nerve</p>
<p>or the gas reflex or a combination of things</p>
<p>and we inhale or inhale.</p>
<p>Right, so a reduction of oxygen intake</p>
<p>generally doesn&rsquo;t stimulate ventilation</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re at altitude.</p>
<p>Then that sort of changes, right?</p>
<p>In general, it&rsquo;s an elevation in CO2</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna stimulate breathing up.</p>
<p>The only reason you bring in O2 for the most part</p>
<p>is to get rid of the CO2.</p>
<p>Oxygen is not a fuel source.</p>
<p>It is not a way, it works the same with fire, by the way.</p>
<p>So you know you have to have oxygen present</p>
<p>for a fire to go and if you squelch oxygen,</p>
<p>the fire will go out, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of half of how those fire extinguishers work.</p>
<p>But we think then that means oxygen is the fuel.</p>
<p>It is not the fuel.</p>
<p>It is something entirely different.</p>
<p>It is a product that is necessary</p>
<p>for the metabolism process to actually occur.</p>
<p>All right, so we&rsquo;re kind of dancing around an idea here,</p>
<p>which is this carbon cycle of life.</p>
<p>So what happens in plants</p>
<p>is they generally will breathe in the opposite</p>
<p>and breathe out the opposite of humans.</p>
<p>So a plant will breathe in CO2 and exhale O2.</p>
<p>All right, this is why we have to have</p>
<p>a certain amount of these things</p>
<p>and algae and forests and trees and stuff</p>
<p>to maintain this O2, CO2 balance in our atmosphere.</p>
<p>We do the opposite.</p>
<p>And so we have this wonderful circle of life.</p>
<p>We breathe in O2, breathe out CO2, they do the opposite.</p>
<p>Well, what happens is because carbohydrates</p>
<p>are long chains of carbon and fats are as well.</p>
<p>Generally, when we think about fats, by the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to understand that structure a little bit.</p>
<p>So if we think about triglycerides,</p>
<p>it is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one, two, three,</p>
<p>and horizontally running off of each one of those</p>
<p>are fatty acid chains, right?</p>
<p>And so we form this structure that looks like an E, right?</p>
<p>Like the letter E, three in the back,</p>
<p>and then three chains coming off of it.</p>
<p>Each of those chains are called fatty acids</p>
<p>and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon, right?</p>
<p>Or a number of carbons strung together.</p>
<p>However many carbons are there</p>
<p>determines which type of fatty acid it is, right?</p>
<p>So stearic acid, linoleic acid,</p>
<p>like any different number of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also what determines whether or not</p>
<p>is a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated</p>
<p>is if carbon requires a special thing called a double bond.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a double bond across every carbon and carbon,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re all fully saturated and you&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any of them that are not double bonded,</p>
<p>in fact, an example,</p>
<p>if there is one that doesn&rsquo;t have a double bond,</p>
<p>that is now called mono and saturated.</p>
<p>And if there are many, it is called polyunsaturated.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s pros and cons to all of these things, right?</p>
<p>In either case, we&rsquo;re still talking long carbon chains.</p>
<p>So what a plant will do is bring in carbon.</p>
<p>And then it has this wonderful ability</p>
<p>to use energy from the sun called photosynthesis.</p>
<p>And it can take those carbons that it inhales</p>
<p>and use the energy from the sun to form a bond.</p>
<p>Now, in our prior discussion,</p>
<p>when we were going over hypertrophy,</p>
<p>we talked about the energy required</p>
<p>to go through protein synthesis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because forming a new atom</p>
<p>or a new bond between atoms oftentimes takes energy.</p>
<p>In this case, it does.</p>
<p>The same thing happens here.</p>
<p>So if a plant does not have oxygen</p>
<p>or does not have carbon dioxide in the air, it has no fuel.</p>
<p>Then basically think about it as that&rsquo;s what it eats.</p>
<p>It needs to get nitrogen from the ground and the soil.</p>
<p>Just like we need to get nitrogen from our protein,</p>
<p>but fuel-wise, it needs to get carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Then it needs sun to give it energy</p>
<p>so that it can actually form that bond.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s getting its fuel from.</p>
<p>So if we think about a classic plant</p>
<p>that produces either a starch or a fruit,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>It inhales that carbon and then it starts packing it away.</p>
<p>Now, in a root vegetable,</p>
<p>what it does is it stores those things together.</p>
<p>And if we store that thing</p>
<p>and we grow a fruit at the bottom of it,</p>
<p>we tend to call those things starches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to then take the carbon</p>
<p>that is packed away in its root and send it up the tree.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna actually do that</p>
<p>by breaking it down into a smaller form of carbohydrate</p>
<p>that we tend to often call things like sucrose and glucose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll ship that up the tree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go out to the leaves</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll convert it into the fruit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna eventually transform that stuff</p>
<p>into smaller carbon things called fructose.</p>
<p>And if we think about the fruit or the sugar in fruit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often in the form of fructose or sucrose</p>
<p>or a combination and sometimes glucose.</p>
<p>So we have these smaller carbon, six carbon chains,</p>
<p>generally in the form of glucose</p>
<p>that are being made from this larger storage</p>
<p>of carbohydrates that we call starch, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s packed in together.</p>
<p>Your body does the exact same thing.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a potato</p>
<p>and it has a whole bunch of glucose packed away,</p>
<p>we call that starch.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in your quadricep</p>
<p>and we pack about a whole bunch of glucose away,</p>
<p>we now call it glycogen.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in your blood as that six carbon chain,</p>
<p>we call it glucose.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in the tree and in the fruit,</p>
<p>we call it fructose, right?</p>
<p>Those are different molecules,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s effectively the same thing happens.</p>
<p>So the biology or the chemistry is almost identical.</p>
<p>It just runs in the reverse order.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why again,</p>
<p>tubers and potatoes and stuff tend to be starches</p>
<p>and fruits tend to be glucose, fructose and sucrose.</p>
<p>So we have this wonderful circle of light.</p>
<p>The plants can survive on just breathing in the CO2</p>
<p>and then getting the energy from the sun.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that ability, at least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>to run through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>So the only way we can get carbon into our system</p>
<p>is to actually ingest carbon,</p>
<p>which means we have to eat the starch, the fruit,</p>
<p>the animal, some other form of stored carbon</p>
<p>to get that into our system.</p>
<p>We then pack that away.</p>
<p>We put the carbohydrates, as you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>either in our liver, our blood, or in our muscles.</p>
<p>We put the fat generally in adipose tissue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put a little bit in muscle cells,</p>
<p>as intramuscular triglycerides,</p>
<p>and then the protein we&rsquo;ll use as structure, right?</p>
<p>To do different things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like to use protein as material or fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to use as structure.</p>
<p>And what we have to do then is if all of a sudden</p>
<p>we realize that storage is getting too much in our body,</p>
<p>in other words, we&rsquo;re gaining too much weight,</p>
<p>we have to figure out how to get the carbons</p>
<p>out of our body.</p>
<p>And that is metabolism, right?</p>
<p>Anytime we&rsquo;re trying to break a carbon bonds</p>
<p>that we can get energy to make ATP,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to release the carbon out of our tissue</p>
<p>into the blood.</p>
<p>We have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon molecule</p>
<p>to make CO2 so we can exhale it</p>
<p>and put it back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful description of the circle of life</p>
<p>and energy utilization in the human body.</p>
<p>I have to ask the question that I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>many people are wondering about,</p>
<p>which is if indeed we exhale these carbons</p>
<p>and as it relates to fat loss,</p>
<p>that is the way that we lose fat</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re in a subcaloric state, for instance.</p>
<p>Has it ever been explored as to whether</p>
<p>increasing the duration or intensity of exhales</p>
<p>can accelerate fat loss?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s sort of the logical extension</p>
<p>of what you described.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m actually interested equally</p>
<p>in whether or not the answer is yes,</p>
<p>as well as whether it could be no.</p>
<p>Because I could imagine if the answer is yes,</p>
<p>well, then there&rsquo;s some interesting protocols</p>
<p>to emerge from that, but that if it&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>it will reveal to us some important bottlenecks</p>
<p>about metabolism and energy utilization.</p>
<p>You ever seen those magicians who like show up</p>
<p>and they can tell your mom&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>or something like that before you</p>
<p>because they can sort of lead you down a path?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, not to take us down a deep dive tangent,</p>
<p>but I once went to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles</p>
<p>and I was one of the people called up front</p>
<p>and an incredible magician named,</p>
<p>I think his name was Ozzy Mind or something.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>He had me write my name on a card in a Sharpie pen.</p>
<p>I ripped up the card, I ripped it up.</p>
<p>I put it in my pocket.</p>
<p>And at the end of the 10 or 15 minute bout</p>
<p>of him doing a bunch of other tricks,</p>
<p>he asked me to look in my right shoe</p>
<p>and under my foot in my right shoe was that card intact.</p>
<p>And it was no longer in my pocket.</p>
<p>And I swear on my life, I wasn&rsquo;t a collaborator with him.</p>
<p>And to this day, it still gives me chills</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know how, magic.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, magic.</p>
<p>Well, the reason I say that is I&rsquo;ve given that little spiel</p>
<p>that I just gave you countless times in my classes.</p>
<p>And I would say 99% of the time, as soon as I stop,</p>
<p>the very first question is,</p>
<p>so can I just like do a bunch of exhales and lose fat?</p>
<p>Which is wonderful,</p>
<p>because I was really hoping you would do that</p>
<p>and you rolled right into my trap.</p>
<p>You landed perfectly.</p>
<p>So I look like a magician over here.</p>
<p>I feel like I should look in my right shoe right now.</p>
<p>No, I asked the question because it&rsquo;s the logical extension</p>
<p>of what you laid out,</p>
<p>but I know biology to be both diabolical and cryptic,</p>
<p>but also exquisite in the way that things are arranged</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get something for nothing.</p>
<p>There are no free passes in physiology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the saying, no free passes.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is yes.</p>
<p>A lot, 100%, yes.</p>
<p>In fact, that is the only way to go about it.</p>
<p>You have two options.</p>
<p>You can ingest less carbon or you can expel more carbon.</p>
<p>People always say calories in, calories out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really carbon in, carbon out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a calorie is, right?</p>
<p>Calories is the amount of energy we get</p>
<p>per breaking a carbon bond.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really less in, more out.</p>
<p>Less in is fairly obvious, whether that comes in any form.</p>
<p>And by the way, this is exactly why the percentage</p>
<p>of your intake coming from fats or carbohydrate,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that much.</p>
<p>If you look at fat loss, clinical trials,</p>
<p>you guys may have covered this when Lane was in here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure like this is something he talks about a lot.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s irrelevant because it&rsquo;s not about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing magic in those things.</p>
<p>They are different.</p>
<p>They have different physiological responses.</p>
<p>Everything is different, right?</p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>But in general, it&rsquo;s just simply about carbon intake.</p>
<p>Turns out fat has a lot more carbons per mole</p>
<p>than carbohydrates do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s more calories per mole in there.</p>
<p>So if you, the physical amount of fat</p>
<p>needs to come in a smaller amount,</p>
<p>physical amount of carbohydrates</p>
<p>will come in as a larger amount,</p>
<p>but you can play any number of very high carb, low fat.</p>
<p>What matters?</p>
<p>Total calories, right?</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not like the only thing that matters,</p>
<p>but you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Some percentages in the way can go.</p>
<p>Fat loss works fantastic.</p>
<p>High fat, low carbohydrate.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why do all these things work?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about total intake of carbon, total exhale.</p>
<p>So absolutely, can you lose fat by simply exhaling more?</p>
<p>In fact, that is exactly what you did this morning.</p>
<p>When I hopped on the Airdyne bike for-</p>
<p>When you did anything, right?</p>
<p>The question is, can you think of a scenario</p>
<p>in which you could have a bunch of</p>
<p>increased rates of exhalation that helps in fat loss?</p>
<p>Sure, I can think of a lot of things</p>
<p>that will stimulate increased rates of exhalation.</p>
<p>One thing could be simply going,</p>
<p>huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.</p>
<p>Right, and so the question is like,</p>
<p>can I literally do some breath protocols</p>
<p>where I force exhale and lose fat?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>But what happens?</p>
<p>What happens if you do hyperventilation training?</p>
<p>Well, my lab studies cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>as one of our many deliberate protocols.</p>
<p>And one of the most prominent things that one observes</p>
<p>is that levels of adrenaline increase very quickly.</p>
<p>Extremely quickly.</p>
<p>People feel jittery, anxious, stressed,</p>
<p>and unless they are consciously trying to anchor</p>
<p>their thinking about what that means</p>
<p>and the benefits set to persisting,</p>
<p>typically they abort the cyclic hyperventilation protocol</p>
<p>really quickly.</p>
<p>Within seconds, right?</p>
<p>You will feel tingling, sweating, all kinds of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hyperventilating, right?</p>
<p>And we could talk ad nauseum about</p>
<p>how that changes everything from adrenaline</p>
<p>to focus to a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, a strategy of sitting around</p>
<p>and just exhaling more than you inhale</p>
<p>technically helps you lose more fat,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to last very long.</p>
<p>So then the question is,</p>
<p>well, how do I get into a situation or a scenario</p>
<p>in which I can increase my rate of expiration</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not gonna pass out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going and altering hypocapnia and hypercapnia issues.</p>
<p>Any idea of a situation in which you would have</p>
<p>an enhanced rate of exhalation</p>
<p>without worrying about passing out?</p>
<p>True, steady state exercise.</p>
<p>Or not steady state exercise, lifting weights,</p>
<p>intervals, moderate training, repeated.</p>
<p>Any of these things, they all work equally for fat loss</p>
<p>because all they&rsquo;re doing is increasing respiration rate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying increased demand for energy,</p>
<p>increased exhalation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the trick here.</p>
<p>And when you equate these things to that,</p>
<p>they have equal success in fat loss.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter theoretically</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re getting it from.</p>
<p>And so when we get into this idea of,</p>
<p>well, what are the best training strategies for fat loss?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which one of these tactics you pick</p>
<p>as long as you maintain a consistent adherence over time</p>
<p>because of this exact fact.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re burning quote unquote fat</p>
<p>in the exercise session</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re burning carbohydrates in the exercise session.</p>
<p>It is totally irrelevant to your net fat loss over time.</p>
<p>Okay, now there&rsquo;s some significant misconceptions there</p>
<p>about what I just talked and I would love to come back</p>
<p>and walk through that in more detail.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the main take home message here.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>because in either case,</p>
<p>it is the same rate of oxygen in and CO2 out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key metric.</p>
<p>And hopefully this helps a lot of people have some relief</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, man, you&rsquo;re so tied up</p>
<p>on what is the exact protocol for training</p>
<p>for optimizing fat loss.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the exact nutritional intervention</p>
<p>I need for fat loss.</p>
<p>And then you wonder why all these different diets</p>
<p>can work effectively</p>
<p>and wonder why all these different training protocols</p>
<p>and surely you know somebody who lost a bunch of weight</p>
<p>and the only thing they did is they just started running.</p>
<p>There was no advanced protocol,</p>
<p>they just started running</p>
<p>and they ran five miles every day.</p>
<p>That works.</p>
<p>And then tons of people who tried that</p>
<p>and like didn&rsquo;t lose anything.</p>
<p>And lots of people who went to,</p>
<p>I went to cardio kickboxing class, lost weight.</p>
<p>Oh, I just started doing intervals on my,</p>
<p>why mysteriously do all these things work?</p>
<p>Something has some spidey sense</p>
<p>has to be going off in your brain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, there has to be something linking these things.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s linking it is simply carbon exchange.</p>
<p>So put yourself in a position</p>
<p>in which you are exhaling more than you inhaling</p>
<p>without passing out.</p>
<p>The other problem is</p>
<p>if you were to simply do a breathing protocol</p>
<p>while the rate of exhalation would go up,</p>
<p>after that you would correct</p>
<p>and go in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the problem is your net carbon output</p>
<p>over the course of the day is not gonna change</p>
<p>unless you increase the demand for energy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you get into that negative state.</p>
<p>Along these lines of exhaling carbons</p>
<p>as the route for fat loss,</p>
<p>it makes me wonder whether or not</p>
<p>increasing lung capacity is possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the answer is yes.</p>
<p>And whether or not increasing lung capacity</p>
<p>is a good goal in route to enhancing fat loss.</p>
<p>Essentially what I&rsquo;m asking is</p>
<p>if you can offload more CO2,</p>
<p>okay, carbons per exhale,</p>
<p>are you a more efficient fat loss machine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful thought and the answer would be no.</p>
<p>Not something to worry about</p>
<p>because if you were to exhale more carbon</p>
<p>than actually needed,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re in a state of inefficiency.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re burning way more energy</p>
<p>than needed to do your activity.</p>
<p>The heart has a metric called cardiac output.</p>
<p>This is in sciences, we abbreviate this as Q</p>
<p>for some odd reasons, it&rsquo;s either CO or Q.</p>
<p>And cardiac output is heart rate</p>
<p>multiplied by stroke volume.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s how many beats per minute you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>as well as how much blood&rsquo;s coming out of it.</p>
<p>So cardiac output is actually</p>
<p>very specific to energy needs.</p>
<p>If you try to work around that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to adjust itself.</p>
<p>So what I mean by this is</p>
<p>if you were able to increase your stroke volumes,</p>
<p>the amount of blood coming out per pump,</p>
<p>you would automatically adjust to reduce your heart rate</p>
<p>so that you keep cardiac output</p>
<p>exact to energetic demands.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re sort of pushing one end of the spectrum</p>
<p>but your body will pull the other one back</p>
<p>to keep you at that exact same neutral level.</p>
<p>So if you look at,</p>
<p>if you think about like cardiovascular adaptations</p>
<p>to endurance training,</p>
<p>any type of endurance training,</p>
<p>a common thing people will understand</p>
<p>is resting heart rate.</p>
<p>And so what that number is</p>
<p>how many beats per minute you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting here doing nothing.</p>
<p>A very positive adaptation</p>
<p>is a lowering of that resting rate over time.</p>
<p>As general numbers,</p>
<p>what you will hear is people will say things like</p>
<p>a normal resting heart rate</p>
<p>is between 60 to 80 beats per minute.</p>
<p>And if any of the things I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>with the individuals I work with,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t work with anybody with disease,</p>
<p>just to clarify that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do anything with disease,</p>
<p>management, treatment, anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always about people who are in a good spot</p>
<p>who wanna optimize or get to the next level.</p>
<p>Whether this is professional athletes</p>
<p>trying to peak for physical performance</p>
<p>or the folks in our rapid health optimization program</p>
<p>that feel good.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not disease stuff</p>
<p>and they wanna feel incredible.</p>
<p>One of the metrics we&rsquo;re gonna pay attention to</p>
<p>is this resting heart rate.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>As you improve your endurance,</p>
<p>your resting heart rate will go down.</p>
<p>If I see somebody over 70 beats per minute,</p>
<p>unless something&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not physically fit.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not that is quote unquote</p>
<p>within the normative values,</p>
<p>I wanna see everybody sub 60 beats per minute or close.</p>
<p>And that is not a difficult thing</p>
<p>to really get to for most people.</p>
<p>So if you train a lot,</p>
<p>regardless of how you train,</p>
<p>intervals, steady state, doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>that resting heart rate will come down.</p>
<p>But since energy demands at rest haven&rsquo;t really changed,</p>
<p>cardiac output stays the same.</p>
<p>So what happens is stroke volume goes up.</p>
<p>So literally like we trained your quadriceps</p>
<p>on the leg extension machine to get stronger</p>
<p>so you can produce more force per contraction,</p>
<p>the heart will do the exact same thing.</p>
<p>And so as you&rsquo;re able to get more of the blood</p>
<p>out of your heart per pump,</p>
<p>the heart realizes I don&rsquo;t need to pump as often.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the compensatory adaptation,</p>
<p>which is saying, hey, look,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to beat 60 times a minute.</p>
<p>I now need to beat 55 times a minute</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m getting the same amount of blood out</p>
<p>per pump, chill.</p>
<p>And this is why your resting heart rate goes down,</p>
<p>your resting stroke volume goes up,</p>
<p>but your cardiac output is identical.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a good metric of fitness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to stay the same.</p>
<p>Cardiac output will only adjust per energetic changes,</p>
<p>energy requirements in the acute moment, right?</p>
<p>How much do I need?</p>
<p>Go, which is gonna be determined by ventilation, right?</p>
<p>How much air am I bringing in and putting out?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna determine cardiac output</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna determine where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>If you were to do like a sub-maximal exercise test,</p>
<p>when you were unfit to when you&rsquo;re fit</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re fit to where you&rsquo;re super fit,</p>
<p>at sub-max, you&rsquo;re gonna see the same thing.</p>
<p>Cardiac output will be identical</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, damn, nothing happened.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re not realizing is your heart rate</p>
<p>at that same workload is now lower</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s efficiency because your stroke volume is higher.</p>
<p>Where it gets people tripped up is at max</p>
<p>because you may not see a much of a change at max</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t really see an increase</p>
<p>in maximum heart rate with fitness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a thing, right?</p>
<p>So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy</p>
<p>for fit or unfit or anything like that.</p>
<p>Stroke volume will get limited eventually</p>
<p>by filling capacity of your heart.</p>
<p>It has to have so much time to fill up with blood</p>
<p>before it can contract again and squeeze the blood out.</p>
<p>And when you have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute,</p>
<p>that just doesn&rsquo;t leave much time to fill.</p>
<p>And so it won&rsquo;t really push you past that.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t worry about trying to increase</p>
<p>your maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily a good thing</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t really change.</p>
<p>But your cardiac output will</p>
<p>because stroke volume will be higher.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that I should avoid training</p>
<p>that gets me up toward maximal heart rate, correct?</p>
<p>Oh, you should absolutely do it.</p>
<p>Right, that was my assumption.</p>

<p>Getting back to energy production and metabolism.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got these different modes of moving energy</p>
<p>but making and breaking energy bonds in the body,</p>
<p>moving energy into different tissues</p>
<p>and out of different tissues</p>
<p>and indeed out of the body through exhalation.</p>
<p>How do each of these different modes of energy utilization</p>
<p>relate to different modes of movement and exercise?</p>
<p>In my mind, I&rsquo;m starting to draw a bridge between,</p>
<p>okay, when I walk for 60 minutes,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m talking, I&rsquo;m breathing a bit more,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m burning a little more fat.</p>
<p>After all, speech is a modified exhale.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m sprinting, I&rsquo;m breathing differently.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m doing a 30 minute moderate,</p>
<p>quote unquote, moderate jog, I&rsquo;m breathing differently.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve beautifully illustrated this bridge</p>
<p>between energy production and utilization</p>
<p>and carbon dioxide offload through exhalation.</p>
<p>What are some of the specifics about energy utilization</p>
<p>according to different modes of exercise?</p>
<p>And if we could better define modes of exercise</p>
<p>or types of exercise that trigger specific adaptations,</p>
<p>I think this is where the bridge will move</p>
<p>from being a mere line to a real structure.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I wanna lay one more foundational piece</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s going to be much easier to understand</p>
<p>the limitations I put on some of these training protocols</p>
<p>as well as the lack of limitations.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s really, really important.</p>
<p>The way I wanna start this is</p>
<p>we have this foundation now of carbon</p>
<p>and basic energy production.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say there&rsquo;s no difference.</p>
<p>There is, and that difference is important.</p>
<p>But maybe we can answer the question from earlier,</p>
<p>which is actually something you asked me this morning</p>
<p>when we were exercising.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, training fasted, right?</p>
<p>Does training fasted enhance fat loss?</p>
<p>And the logic is sound.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t have any fuel,</p>
<p>then I should be burning more fat,</p>
<p>therefore I shouldn&rsquo;t be losing more fat, it&rsquo;s sound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these classic things in science</p>
<p>and exercise physiology where you&rsquo;re like, sounds good.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a pretty gross misunderstanding</p>
<p>of metabolism.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not to pick on that topic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about that topic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a common question.</p>
<p>It also gives me an opportunity</p>
<p>to just tell you more about metabolism.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>You are breathing in O2 and breathing out CO2.</p>
<p>However, the ratio to that is what we call</p>
<p>the either RER, respiratory exchange ratio,</p>
<p>or RQ, respiratory quotient.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna differentiate those two.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the same thing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna skip past that for now.</p>
<p>As you begin to increase exercise intensity,</p>
<p>the percentage of O2 to CO2 rises in the favor of CO2.</p>
<p>So you start breathing out way more CO2</p>
<p>than you are breathing in O2, right?</p>
<p>And so if we were to look at that number,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the relationship?</p>
<p>It goes up.</p>
<p>So at rest, most people have a value</p>
<p>that we would typically call something like 0.6, okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, again, the relationship between O2 and CO2.</p>
<p>Maybe 0.7.</p>
<p>If you were to go for a walk, that increases slightly</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re now expiring CO2 at a higher rate.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve moved up to say 0.8 or something like that.</p>
<p>One of the ways that we mark somebody</p>
<p>of achieving an actual VO2 max on a test</p>
<p>is if that value exceeds 1.1.</p>
<p>Now, any of you who are paying attention</p>
<p>and thinking, well, wait a minute,</p>
<p>how the hell can a ratio between two things</p>
<p>ever get past one?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re getting into a place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually offloading more CO2</p>
<p>than is actually necessary.</p>
<p>And this is what actually causes and explains</p>
<p>a thing that people like to call EPOC,</p>
<p>which is excess exercise post-oxygen consumption.</p>
<p>This is another way to think about it.</p>
<p>The only reason you&rsquo;re breathing</p>
<p>is to bring in oxygen when offload CO2, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m no longer exercising, why am I still breathing?</p>
<p>In other words, once you stop the demand</p>
<p>or the need for energy, you should stop ventilating,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because in the case of low intensity exercise,</p>
<p>the second you stop,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right back down to respiring ventilation.</p>
<p>No problem, because you were able to match</p>
<p>the need for energy with the offload of waste</p>
<p>one-to-one during that exercise.</p>
<p>When you start creeping up the intensity, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So you have to basically start stealing</p>
<p>a little bit of fuel here.</p>
<p>So even though you&rsquo;re done exercising,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still ventilating because you have to pay that back.</p>
<p>And pay that back by that,</p>
<p>I specifically mean you have to bring in oxygen</p>
<p>because you have a whole bunch of waste</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been accumulating in your tissue</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got to deal with.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll walk you through what that waste is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particular molecule</p>
<p>that a lot of people have heard of,</p>
<p>but grossly misunderstand.</p>
<p>So you got to be able to handle that.</p>
<p>So the reason that you sit there and go,</p>
<p>and continue to ventilate</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;re now trying to pay back</p>
<p>that excess post-exercise oxygen debt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that oxygen debt we&rsquo;re specifically talking about.</p>
<p>All right, so that being said,</p>
<p>as we start cruising up,</p>
<p>that RRQ starts going up, up, up, up, up, up, up.</p>
<p>And if we get to one, you&rsquo;re 1.0,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hurting, you&rsquo;re in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I like that, you&rsquo;re hurting, you&rsquo;re in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>A window into Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Now you really want to be a subject in his laboratory study.</p>
<p>Masochists swarm to Andy&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So the idea that I will lose more fat</p>
<p>by being in an exercise situation that is burning more fat,</p>
<p>it seems to make sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a massive failure to understand the metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the exact same explanation</p>
<p>as why exercising fasted doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So the exercising fasted issue under normal circumstances</p>
<p>is irrelevant because you have plenty of fuel in the system</p>
<p>even when you haven&rsquo;t eaten breakfast that morning.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re talking like extended fasting</p>
<p>over multiple days, this is a different scenario.</p>
<p>If muscle glycogen, liver glycogen,</p>
<p>and blood glucose are at sufficient levels,</p>
<p>then you absolutely have enough energy</p>
<p>to perform almost any type of exercise</p>
<p>that most people are doing.</p>
<p>Maybe if you&rsquo;re Rob and you&rsquo;re at mile 20 today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different story,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of us have plenty of fuel</p>
<p>sitting around, so we&rsquo;re not going to burn more into fat</p>
<p>just because we didn&rsquo;t eat breakfast that morning.</p>
<p>So that just doesn&rsquo;t make energetic sense.</p>
<p>We have a lot of backup supplies and you&rsquo;re never out.</p>
<p>The trick here is this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a concept here we call crossover concept.</p>
<p>So as we are starting to move up exercise intensity,</p>
<p>we start burning a higher percentage of our fuel</p>
<p>from carbohydrates</p>
<p>and a lower percentage of our fuel coming from fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sleeping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the highest percentage of your fuel</p>
<p>that will be coming from fat</p>
<p>of any activity you could ever do.</p>
<p>So if the theory that I&rsquo;m going to stay at a lower intensity</p>
<p>to burn more fat was true,</p>
<p>the optimal fat burning strategy would then be to sleep.</p>
<p>Like that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Of course it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So why would then going at a slightly elevated rate</p>
<p>somehow all of a sudden magically make you lose fat?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually make sense.</p>
<p>When you think about that, we were like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a percentage trick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difference between absolute and relative.</p>
<p>This is what this confusion is.</p>
<p>So yes, as you start doing lower intensity exercise,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re fast or not, it&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>But lower intensity exercise,</p>
<p>a greater percentage of your fuel is coming from fat.</p>
<p>However, your total fuel expenditure is very low.</p>
<p>So that whole total carbon balance</p>
<p>is not really being shifted much.</p>
<p>As you start exercising at a very high intensity,</p>
<p>you actually start getting a higher percentage</p>
<p>of your fuel from carbohydrate</p>
<p>and a lower percentage from fat.</p>
<p>In fact, at rest, about the highest you can get</p>
<p>in most people is about 60% of your fuel from fat.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re sleeping, you might be 70%,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll never be in a position ever,</p>
<p>no matter what sort of thing you&rsquo;ve heard on the internet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never be in a situation</p>
<p>where fat is your only fuel source.</p>
<p>The highest I&rsquo;ve probably ever seen is like 70%.</p>
<p>You should probably be at about,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a kind of a good number to think, honestly.</p>
<p>But people who understand a little bit</p>
<p>about metabolism to be dangerous, but not enough,</p>
<p>will throw out these terms like fat adapted.</p>
<p>And fat adapted is a real thing,</p>
<p>but it is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes, right?</p>
<p>It is this idea of thinking like,</p>
<p>I can get to a spot where I&rsquo;m maximizing fat burning.</p>
<p>Maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise</p>
<p>and maximizing fat loss over time</p>
<p>are not the same thing at all, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the confusion.</p>
<p>So if you enhance fat oxidation in an exercise,</p>
<p>that does not enhance fat loss per se, right?</p>
<p>So this is a lot of the confusion that&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>So as we start moving up,</p>
<p>we can never get in a position</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re using fat only as a fuel.</p>
<p>Again, at best you&rsquo;re at 70% fat, 30% carbohydrate.</p>
<p>For a lot of reasons,</p>
<p>we probably just don&rsquo;t have time to get into today.</p>
<p>However, the opposite is possible.</p>
<p>When you get into true high intensity exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be basically 100% carbohydrate and 0% fat, right?</p>
<p>That is very possible.</p>
<p>That in fact is 1.0.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what our cue, 1.1 is actually</p>
<p>because your ventilation got so high,</p>
<p>you actually exceeded that number,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re at 100% carbohydrate.</p>
<p>This is what people came up with the idea then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, whoa, I don&rsquo;t wanna burn carbs,</p>
<p>I wanna lose fat.</p>
<p>So my response to that is always like, okay, great.</p>
<p>So it makes sense, burning fat, losing fat,</p>
<p>burning carbs is losing what then?</p>
<p>Like you think your liver shrunk?</p>
<p>Like, wait a minute, what did you lose then?</p>
<p>Where did it come from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all coming as carbon.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about where it came from for your fuel.</p>
<p>It just has to come out as carbon, right?</p>
<p>There are differences in exercise efficiency for performance</p>
<p>with our professional athletes, of course,</p>
<p>but if the only goal here is fat loss,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you get it from.</p>
<p>The last bridge we have to connect here is like,</p>
<p>well, wait a minute, if I only burned carbohydrate,</p>
<p>how did I actually lose that fat?</p>
<p>There was that love handle sitting on the side of me.</p>
<p>How did that come out of me?</p>
<p>If I never burned that for my fuel?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re failing to understand</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a balance game that happens here.</p>
<p>So if you were to do a bunch</p>
<p>of high intensity exercise training</p>
<p>and you burned only muscle glycogen and blood glucose,</p>
<p>and maybe even you did it for so long,</p>
<p>you burned some liver glycogen.</p>
<p>The body understands that it has expelled a lot of energy</p>
<p>from that side of the equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to do a couple of things.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s very difficult to go through this fancy situation</p>
<p>where you convert carbohydrates into fat and back and forth.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s actually like fairly hard.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s easier to do is something you said earlier</p>
<p>is actually just bias energetics to a different fuel source.</p>
<p>In that scenario where you&rsquo;re down really low</p>
<p>in your carbohydrate stores,</p>
<p>any carbohydrates you bring in are going to go to storage.</p>
<p>And since your net energy expenditure</p>
<p>is something that your body regulates a lot,</p>
<p>any fat that you then bring in</p>
<p>is going to be utilized as a fuel source</p>
<p>because it knows it doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore.</p>
<p>That is in excess.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how you actually use fat as a fuel</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve burned down carbohydrate storages.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m hearing this, a couple of things come to mind.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for that incredibly important</p>
<p>description of what is otherwise</p>
<p>a very confusing landscape for most people.</p>
<p>One of the key points I took away,</p>
<p>and I just want to say from the outset,</p>
<p>this is not exhaustive by any stretch,</p>
<p>is that burning fat does not equal</p>
<p>losing fat from the body.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And then burning fat has to be divided</p>
<p>into burning of body fat stores.</p>
<p>And we need to distinguish that</p>
<p>from burning of dietary fat that is brought in.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people don&rsquo;t disambiguate those.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also understanding that reducing</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s body carbohydrate stores,</p>
<p>muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, et cetera,</p>
<p>occurs during high-intensity exercise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other ways, but that is one very efficient way</p>
<p>to tap into those stores, which makes me wonder,</p>
<p>again, this is one of these things that,</p>
<p>does it lead to a protocol,</p>
<p>makes me wonder whether or not doing high-intensity,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say weight training for 45 to 60 minutes,</p>
<p>75 minutes of strength training, power training,</p>
<p>hypertrophy training, which we&rsquo;ve covered in an episode</p>
<p>about those topics,</p>
<p>and then doing some steady state cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>is there any benefit to that arrangement</p>
<p>that would quote-unquote enhance body fat loss</p>
<p>from the body, to be very specific now,</p>
<p>because unlike the idea that training fasted</p>
<p>would shift the bias towards fat loss,</p>
<p>which it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ve told us,</p>
<p>under those conditions, muscle glycogen</p>
<p>and maybe even liver glycogen is going to be depleted.</p>
<p>Put simply, can I enhance body fat loss</p>
<p>by doing some cardio after a bout of weight training?</p>
<p>If you equate for total energy expenditure, it won&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Now, you did bring up a very important point</p>
<p>that I want to clarify.</p>
<p>If you look at the exercise modalities</p>
<p>that we laid out in our previous conversations,</p>
<p>we talked about nine different adaptations.</p>
<p>One was skill, and then speed, power, strength,</p>
<p>hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic capacity,</p>
<p>aerobic capacity, and long-duration endurance.</p>
<p>Now, speed, power, and skill development</p>
<p>have almost no benefit for fat loss,</p>
<p>because remember, those are low weight,</p>
<p>a lot of rest, and low volume.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really going to be helpful.</p>
<p>You can make a little bit of a case for strength,</p>
<p>a little bit, but the total energy expenditure</p>
<p>for strength training, even if it&rsquo;s an hour,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s truly strength training, it&rsquo;s fairly low.</p>
<p>Because the repetitions are in the one to three range.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough for total work.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to develop a protocol</p>
<p>that sort of optimizes fat loss,</p>
<p>what you want to do, you were close.</p>
<p>In my opinion, is do a combination of something</p>
<p>in the hypertrophy slash muscular endurance</p>
<p>strength training realm.</p>
<p>Okay, so six to 30 repetitions.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Of resistance training.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Deplete muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>maybe even a little bit of liver glycogen.</p>
<p>Maybe a little bit, depending on if you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>for a long time, but probably not a noticeable amount.</p>
<p>Okay, so an hour of hypertrophy type training.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training hard with low rest intervals</p>
<p>and you really did an hour, you would for sure get there.</p>
<p>But most people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Is that the reason why I crave large bowls</p>
<p>of oatmeal and rice after I do weight training?</p>
<p>I want to replenish muscle glycogen.</p>
<p>Totally, right?</p>
<p>Then you maybe do a little bit of very high intensity,</p>
<p>maximum heart rate, well over VO2 max.</p>
<p>Hard as you can for 20, 30, 45, 60 seconds,</p>
<p>something like that with some recovery,</p>
<p>a lot of recovery and repeated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to do a great job</p>
<p>of depletion muscle glycogen, right?</p>
<p>If you do that long enough, you&rsquo;ll get the liver.</p>
<p>But again, most people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really, really hard to go that hard.</p>
<p>So liver is sort of last resort.</p>
<p>Yeah, basic mechanics here,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll actually get into as our third segment here</p>
<p>is energy production comes from the local exercising muscle</p>
<p>first and foremost from phosphocreatine</p>
<p>and carbohydrate stores, right?</p>
<p>And so again, and we store it in muscle,</p>
<p>we call it glycogen, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just your first sign of light on defense.</p>
<p>If you need glucose outside of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start pulling it from the blood.</p>
<p>But one of the things,</p>
<p>your body regulates a handful of things</p>
<p>over almost everything, blood pH, blood glucose,</p>
<p>blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations.</p>
<p>Like it really does not want to mess</p>
<p>with those things at all.</p>
<p>It will change almost anything else in the body</p>
<p>to keep those things standardized, right?</p>
<p>You generally, because you need all those things</p>
<p>for your brain to work</p>
<p>and your brain will stop working, right?</p>
<p>If you lose blood pressure, it won&rsquo;t go up there.</p>
<p>pH changes, you can&rsquo;t run metabolism.</p>
<p>Electrolytes change, you can&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>And glucose is a primary fuel source for the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a problem, right?</p>
<p>So if that number starts to come down</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re grabbing glucose out of the blood,</p>
<p>your liver is going to then kick in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to break down its glycogen</p>
<p>to put glucose in the blood</p>
<p>to keep the blood number, the level.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the things you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>is blood glucose concentrations rise during exercise.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t fall.</p>
<p>In fact, they rise as an anticipatory state.</p>
<p>If you train a lot,</p>
<p>your blood glucose will start going up</p>
<p>before you start moving.</p>
<p>It knows it&rsquo;s coming, right?</p>
<p>So you can play that game.</p>
<p>You can rob Peter to pay Paul for a long time</p>
<p>until your liver runs out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what actually is a bonk</p>
<p>in terms of like long duration endurance stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking many, many, many miles,</p>
<p>several hours typically.</p>
<p>We say, oh, it&rsquo;s got to be over two hours</p>
<p>before your liver starts to become a real problem</p>
<p>or it has to be tremendously intense</p>
<p>because of those reasons.</p>
<p>You have to burn through just a lot of energy</p>
<p>before your liver starts to get into a problem.</p>
<p>You can continue to train</p>
<p>when your muscle glycogen levels are low.</p>
<p>In fact, people say glycogen depletion in muscle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s generally a misnomer.</p>
<p>And you are going to just have tremendous signals of fatigue</p>
<p>when that number gets lower than 75%.</p>
<p>So people think that like their muscles are getting heavy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably still 75% full.</p>
<p>A lot of folks will quit around the 50%.</p>
<p>The highest I&rsquo;ve ever seen is like 95% true depletion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an extremely high level cross-country skiers</p>
<p>and like their deltoid gets very, very low.</p>
<p>Some very talented runners will get fairly low</p>
<p>in their quads, but the vast majority of folks,</p>
<p>by the time you&rsquo;re 50% depleted, you&rsquo;re going to quit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be really, really challenging.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re never really going to get that low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a bit of a protective mechanism, right?</p>
<p>But when your liver gets low, you&rsquo;re going to be shut down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the case of if you&rsquo;ve ever been to like a marathon</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve seen people run like 25 and a half miles</p>
<p>and then they just like bonk,</p>
<p>they go into like baby deer walking stance</p>
<p>and then they collapse and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>how are you mentally weak?</p>
<p>Like you ran 26 miles and you can&rsquo;t run the last point.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t mentally weak.</p>
<p>It is if your liver is done, it&rsquo;s going to stop you</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no more backup reserves.</p>
<p>Muscle you can get away with, you can push through it.</p>
<p>Liver will not let you go any farther.</p>
<p>I find this fascinating because it makes me wonder</p>
<p>whether or not the liver being depleted</p>
<p>sends a neural signal to the brain</p>
<p>or the brain must register some signal.</p>
<p>I would like to be alive tomorrow, thank you.</p>
<p>Whatever is happening right now,</p>
<p>stopping is going to be safer than continuing.</p>
<p>And so that stop signal is one that I think a lot of people,</p>
<p>including myself, are intrigued by</p>
<p>because we always think that it&rsquo;s related to willpower,</p>
<p>but the brain needs to preserve itself.</p>
<p>And as the master computer,</p>
<p>I mean, there are ways to go into kind of automaton type,</p>
<p>not thinking, just doing type of behavior.</p>
<p>You have override switches, right?</p>
<p>And you can play those cards</p>
<p>and you can get better at learning</p>
<p>and being less sensitive to that switch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what happened when you first start training.</p>
<p>You start to realize like, oh my gosh, I&rsquo;m super tired.</p>
<p>And then you realize really quick,</p>
<p>like, oh, I&rsquo;m totally fine here.</p>
<p>And this is like the, pick your person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s made sayings like this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re really only 10% depleted</p>
<p>or 30% or 40% or something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all operating at 40% of what we could do.</p>
<p>Of course, any of those things are true</p>
<p>because it is like a little bit of an override.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just gotten very sensitive</p>
<p>to being a small percentage depleted</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve learned, okay, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>And there is a long way to go past that.</p>
<p>But once you get past that</p>
<p>and you flip that override switch a lot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to break quickly</p>
<p>because you basically learned to ignore that signal</p>
<p>and problems can happen really quickly after that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s even experienced endurance athletes.</p>
<p>If you hit that level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going to be hitting the concrete next.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s potentially a problem.</p>
<p>I want to make sure I understand a concept</p>
<p>that you referred to earlier correctly</p>
<p>because I have a feeling that I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s this issue of how the body accesses</p>
<p>body fat stores when in a sub caloric state</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing mainly glycogen burning exercise.</p>
<p>What I heard you say,</p>
<p>and please correct me where I&rsquo;m undoubtedly wrong.</p>
<p>What I heard you say was that,</p>
<p>okay, I go into the gym and I start lifting weights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m burning muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>mostly local to the muscles that I&rsquo;m using.</p>
<p>And then I start pulling glycogen from the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some body fat stores that are mobilized,</p>
<p>probably not dipping into my liver glycogen.</p>
<p>Okay, I complete the workout.</p>
<p>Maybe I even hop on the air dime bike</p>
<p>and do a little sprint.</p>
<p>I go for a jog.</p>
<p>Maybe I eat immediately afterward.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t eat for a few hours afterwards,</p>
<p>but across the day, I ingest fewer calories than I burn.</p>
<p>Is it the case that body fat is mobilized</p>
<p>in order to replace the glycogen</p>
<p>that my sub caloric intake was insufficient to provide?</p>
<p>In other words, because I didn&rsquo;t eat enough</p>
<p>to fill the glycogen stores,</p>
<p>am I using body fat converted into glycogen</p>
<p>to fill those stores?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if so, is that a case</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m no longer exhaling carbons</p>
<p>in order to burn body fat,</p>
<p>but rather I&rsquo;m repurposing body fat into muscle?</p>
<p>Have I turned fat into muscle in that case?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m really glad you asked this</p>
<p>because I did a very poor job</p>
<p>on that last point talking about earlier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m realizing, playing back in my head,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s so many really good questions.</p>
<p>You cannot turn fat into muscle.</p>
<p>Can you turn muscle into fat?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you said that</p>
<p>because when I was in college,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to out that person,</p>
<p>the physiology teacher seemed to think still at that point</p>
<p>that one could lift weights, get muscular,</p>
<p>but then it would eventually turn into body fat.</p>
<p>That myth has, I think, largely been dispelled.</p>
<p>I heard that so many times as a kid.</p>
<p>I heard it so many times in college.</p>
<p>I hear it so many times in our undergraduate students</p>
<p>from other faculty and such.</p>
<p>So no, they&rsquo;re not the same structures.</p>
<p>They are very different.</p>
<p>Let me take a shot at answering this better.</p>
<p>You were really, really, really close.</p>
<p>So yeah, if you were to do that type of exercise</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve burned a lot of muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>how is it I&rsquo;m losing stored fat?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the crux of the question.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t even actually matter</p>
<p>if you then went ahead and ingested carbohydrates</p>
<p>or fat post-exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really the thing.</p>
<p>You hit on a couple of key things.</p>
<p>Number one, this is all under the assumption</p>
<p>that total caloric intake is still low, right?</p>
<p>You have to have&hellip;</p>
<p>Below total need.</p>
<p>Below total need, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I also want to flag calories in, calories out</p>
<p>is not the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>This is a very complex thing.</p>
<p>Calories in is incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>Calories out is even more complicated, okay?</p>
<p>So we just&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe another series we can spend on that alone.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t go nuts about that.</p>
<p>You have to be hypo caloric one way or the other.</p>
<p>If you burn a bunch of muscle glycogen</p>
<p>and you are hyper caloric, you&rsquo;re still going to add fat.</p>
<p>If you burn a bunch of muscle glycogen</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re hypo caloric, you&rsquo;re going to lose fat, right?</p>
<p>Think about it this way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a negative calorie state.</p>
<p>Where are those calories going to come from?</p>
<p>Are you going to reduce</p>
<p>your muscle glycogen storages permanently?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, are you going to reduce</p>
<p>your glycogen storage in your liver?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You want to reduce blood glucose?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No way, right?</p>
<p>So where is that extra energy coming from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming from your storage fat.</p>
<p>It is your backup reserve energy system.</p>
<p>The way that I want to flag this here is</p>
<p>people tend to think about it</p>
<p>as like carbohydrates versus fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like a chain, more like a bicycle</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a front gear and a back gear.</p>
<p>You turn one gear, it turns the other one.</p>
<p>These are complementary systems.</p>
<p>They are not and or systems, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re turning one.</p>
<p>And when we go through carbohydrate metabolism,</p>
<p>maybe here in a second,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll understand why you have to have</p>
<p>an anaerobic and an aerobic component to that.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no way</p>
<p>to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen.</p>
<p>That has to happen.</p>
<p>The only way to engage in fat metabolism</p>
<p>is aerobic and oxygen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no anaerobic component to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental difference there.</p>
<p>So your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible.</p>
<p>It is the primary fuel source for a reason.</p>
<p>Your fat is not meant to be flexible.</p>
<p>It is meant to be unlimited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic point.</p>
<p>So you want flexibility over here</p>
<p>and an unlimited capacity over there.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m safeguarded against any energetic need, okay?</p>
<p>I need to run up a hill for safety.</p>
<p>Cool, carbohydrates are there.</p>
<p>I need to then run for 17 hours.</p>
<p>Cool, fat is there.</p>
<p>We want both of these systems.</p>
<p>You wanna be able to have great energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>You want a slow drip coming from fat.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want up and down, up and down.</p>
<p>Feel great, up and down.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>You wanna be able to think very quickly</p>
<p>and get hyper-focused.</p>
<p>Boom, carbohydrates ramp right up, right?</p>
<p>Get it into the brain, get thinking better,</p>
<p>get thinking clearly fast.</p>
<p>So we want all of these, not just for exercise purposes,</p>
<p>but for activities of daily living,</p>
<p>we want an optimal system here.</p>
<p>When people use the terms like fat adapted,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re generally hijacking that and they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>it used to be a thing we said all the time</p>
<p>in like all of my undergraduate classes for years.</p>
<p>And that idea of metabolic flexibility</p>
<p>is using optimal fuel sources and optimal times,</p>
<p>not maximizing fat usage.</p>
<p>The people have co-opted that term</p>
<p>of metabolic flexibility to be like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, yeah, therefore learn how to maximize fat burning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what that term means.</p>
<p>That term means maximizing your ability</p>
<p>to use whatever fuel is optimal in that time.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll grant you,</p>
<p>most people aren&rsquo;t fantastic at using fat as a fuel source</p>
<p>relative to the other direction,</p>
<p>but nonetheless the gold standard here</p>
<p>should be maximizing both.</p>
<p>All right, finally answering your question.</p>
<p>If I were to burn a bunch of muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>how am I losing that fat?</p>
<p>Well, the fuel you&rsquo;re ingesting in that hypochloric state</p>
<p>is going to say, hey look,</p>
<p>we have a lot of muscle glycogen we have to replenish.</p>
<p>So any carbohydrate that comes in</p>
<p>needs to be biased towards storage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to go into those tissue.</p>
<p>Any fat that comes in or doesn&rsquo;t even come in,</p>
<p>but any fat that we&rsquo;re using for fuel</p>
<p>needs to be utilized for activity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the caloric expenditure from fat comes in.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically saying your general physiology,</p>
<p>the energy for that starts coming from fat.</p>
<p>And the energy that&rsquo;s coming in from carbohydrate</p>
<p>needs to be simply stored.</p>
<p>And so what you see is your respiratory cushion changes.</p>
<p>Right, the RER is going off.</p>
<p>And so in the exercise moment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s shot way up for carbohydrates</p>
<p>and shot way down for fat.</p>
<p>As a compensatory response, it goes the other direction</p>
<p>because your body is saying we are low on carbohydrates,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use them for fuel,</p>
<p>unless we absolutely have to, right?</p>
<p>So use them for storage.</p>
<p>Get our fuel from the fat side of the equation.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re generally going to say is like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m burning more fat just sitting around</p>
<p>after things like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not even taking into the equation,</p>
<p>the EPOC part, which is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not actually as large as people think it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fairly small, but it adds up sort of over time.</p>
<p>So does that explain a little bit better</p>
<p>about how you lose fat</p>
<p>when you actually only burn carbs for exercise?</p>
<p>Yeah, you explained it beautifully.</p>
<p>You talked about EPOC,</p>
<p>the post-exercise oxygen consumption,</p>
<p>not being that significant in terms of energy utilization.</p>
<p>Even though today we&rsquo;re talking about endurance</p>
<p>and different forms of endurance,</p>
<p>I do have to ask whether or not people consider</p>
<p>the elevation in basal metabolism</p>
<p>that occurs when there&rsquo;s more muscle around</p>
<p>because muscle is such a metabolically demanding tissue.</p>
<p>Is there a straightforward-ish equation?</p>
<p>If one adds one pound of lean muscle tissue to their body,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s distributed across multiple muscle groups,</p>
<p>does that equate to a caloric need</p>
<p>of X number of calories per day?</p>
<p>And is that because of the muscle protein synthesis needs</p>
<p>of that muscle or it&rsquo;s glycogen storage needs or both?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough muscle,</p>
<p>you start to have problems with fat loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult challenge.</p>
<p>If you have enough muscle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just trying to get extremely large,</p>
<p>if your FFMI is 24 and you&rsquo;re 15% body fat,</p>
<p>adding more muscle is not really gonna play a lot</p>
<p>in the equation and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat,</p>
<p>but fat is not inert.</p>
<p>So fat is still going to burn a small number of calories.</p>
<p>Muscle burns more,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not nearly what people think it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a muscle guy, I&rsquo;m a muscle physiologist.</p>
<p>I would love to get people to have more muscle</p>
<p>for any excuse I can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not honest to say that though.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about when I was in undergraduate,</p>
<p>we would say numbers like 50 kcals per day per pound</p>
<p>is what you can look at, right?</p>
<p>So if you put on a pound of muscle spread across the body,</p>
<p>your basal metabolic rate would go up</p>
<p>by around 50 calories per day.</p>
<p>I think that number is grossly exaggerated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a 10th of that, six to 10 calories, maybe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly what that number is,</p>
<p>but the more recent estimates are something like that.</p>
<p>So now on one hand, you could say,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, that is not even meaningful.</p>
<p>The other hand, you could say that&rsquo;s super meaningful.</p>
<p>It just depends on time domain</p>
<p>you want to put that out, right?</p>
<p>So if you were to put on five pounds of muscle</p>
<p>and your basal metabolic rate went up</p>
<p>30 or 40 calories a day,</p>
<p>well, over the course of a thousand days,</p>
<p>like that actually adds up.</p>
<p>So you can slice this any way you want.</p>
<p>Now, maybe that number is somewhere in between.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a field I pay that much attention to candidly</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a metric kind of like Epoch</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, we used to really harp on it</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>well, maybe we exaggerated that like honestly just a bit.</p>
<p>But to me, it doesn&rsquo;t change the equation much</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t have enough muscle, as I described,</p>
<p>there are other consequences</p>
<p>that are going to make fat loss hard.</p>
<p>And so you need to have sufficient muscle.</p>
<p>If the additional caloric expenditure is the carrot, great.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something else, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just enough evidence that you need to have it.</p>
<p>Or I should say, there&rsquo;s enough evidence</p>
<p>that it will really help you in your path.</p>
<p>Maybe a few calories here, there is not really that thing.</p>
<p>Especially if you understand a normal food item,</p>
<p>anything you pick is going to be</p>
<p>probably a couple of hundred calories.</p>
<p>One bad food choice a day</p>
<p>will outkick almost any amount of coverage</p>
<p>you got on adding muscle mass to you.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re really stepping over a dollar</p>
<p>to pick up a dime.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about how many calories</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting from adding muscle,</p>
<p>fat loss is going to be about regulating that carbon intake</p>
<p>above and beyond anything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>to acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>and wellbeing can only be analyzed</p>
<p>from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests</p>
<p>out there, however, is that you get information back</p>
<p>about various levels of lipids and hormones</p>
<p>and metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes knowing what to do</p>
<p>with all that information exceedingly easy.</p>
<p>They have a personalized platform that lets you see</p>
<p>what your specific numbers are, of course,</p>
<p>but then also what sorts of behavioral do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional changes,</p>
<p>what sorts of supplementation would allow you</p>
<p>to bring those levels into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard about this concept of metabolic flexibility</p>
<p>mentioned a few times.</p>
<p>Frankly, you&rsquo;re the first person who&rsquo;s ever explained it</p>
<p>to me in a clear and concise way.</p>
<p>How do I know if I am metabolically flexible</p>
<p>and how do I increase my metabolic flexibility?</p>
<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s no specific standard,</p>
<p>which is actually a good thing, right?</p>
<p>And so if you have a level of specificity</p>
<p>that you want or need metabolically,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t actually want to be in this middle ground.</p>
<p>An example would be if you are performing</p>
<p>in a type of exercise or an athlete who performs</p>
<p>in a sport that is glycolytically dominated,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be optimally metabolically flexible.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be super, quote unquote, fat adapted.</p>
<p>You want to be biased towards the energy you&rsquo;re going to use.</p>
<p>The same could be true for the other end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>So in those particular cases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not optimal to be equally effective</p>
<p>because there are no free passes in physiology, right?</p>
<p>Your energy producing systems</p>
<p>will up-regulate or down-regulate accordingly.</p>
<p>So you will actually limit your ability</p>
<p>to say maximally utilize carbohydrates as a fuel</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to up-regulate your ability</p>
<p>to use fat as a fuel.</p>
<p>And so this is like, there&rsquo;s a saturation point.</p>
<p>Outside of that spectrum, most people would just say,</p>
<p>hey, like I want to feel great throughout the day</p>
<p>to be able to do a bunch of different things.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of biological markers you can take.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also just some practical takes.</p>
<p>Now, none of these markers by themselves are any sign.</p>
<p>What you want to do is probably a couple of them</p>
<p>and then say, okay, this is maybe a clue.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s really important to emphasize</p>
<p>not a single one of these tests</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m about to walk you through</p>
<p>automatically means you can&rsquo;t use fat as a fuel</p>
<p>or the other case, which is maybe you&rsquo;re poor</p>
<p>at using carbohydrate as a fuel.</p>
<p>So disclaimers aside, we&rsquo;ll get into a couple of them.</p>
<p>So should we think about these as informative and useful</p>
<p>but not diagnostic?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We would call this data inspired or data led</p>
<p>and not data driven, right?</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So number one, you want to think about</p>
<p>just overall functionality.</p>
<p>Do you have a reasonable regulation</p>
<p>of your energy throughout the day?</p>
<p>Now, many things could be going into this</p>
<p>which is why these are not specific diagnostics</p>
<p>but as a basic measure, we talked about blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people will say,</p>
<p>again, you want that to be something like</p>
<p>between 80 and 90 milligrams per deciliter</p>
<p>is a blood glucose level.</p>
<p>And you can go look at the cutoff points</p>
<p>for what determines to be pre-diabetic</p>
<p>and type two diabetic, et cetera.</p>
<p>What I can actually recommend,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of science here actually</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll talk you through,</p>
<p>but a lot of this is my personal preference.</p>
<p>I generally want people to be at 85 or lower.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of a couple of things.</p>
<p>Number one, there&rsquo;s actually some papers that showed</p>
<p>every single point increase above 85</p>
<p>increases your likelihood of developing type two diabetes</p>
<p>by about 6%.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So technically while maybe 90 or 95 or even up to 100</p>
<p>are in the quote unquote normative values,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one clue.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not definitive by itself,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>
<p>You need to really pay attention to what increasing</p>
<p>by 6% actually means,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a data point where I&rsquo;m looking at.</p>
<p>If I actually then see symptomology</p>
<p>and we run you through maybe some questionnaires,</p>
<p>ask how you&rsquo;re feeling throughout the day</p>
<p>and we see uncontrolled energy bouts.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a lot of energy,</p>
<p>then you get really, really tired and swings.</p>
<p>Okay, another data point.</p>
<p>All right, and we may patch a few of these things together.</p>
<p>That may give me some clues.</p>
<p>That being said, again, a lot of this rhetoric is used</p>
<p>to then scare people off of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And that is, I want to be as clear as possible.</p>
<p>That is not, not truly the only thing</p>
<p>people should care about, right?</p>
<p>It can be a thing that can also be unrelated.</p>
<p>There are reasons you could have blood glucose concentrations</p>
<p>at this level or energy swings</p>
<p>that are unrelated to carbohydrate ingestion at all.</p>
<p>All right, so one test you can either run.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to get blood glucose measured,</p>
<p>you can look at some markers we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>which are AST and ALT.</p>
<p>We talked about how you can kind of look at that</p>
<p>AST to ALT ratio before.</p>
<p>You can actually do the inverse,</p>
<p>which is look at ALT and AST.</p>
<p>The kind of normative value there</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to look at is like 0.8.</p>
<p>I actually like to see it lower than that.</p>
<p>And that alone has been actually associated</p>
<p>with blood glucose dysregulation.</p>
<p>And so if you see multiple of these signs,</p>
<p>again, we&rsquo;re looking for patterns and patterns and patterns</p>
<p>in both, in our case, biomarkers,</p>
<p>symptomology and performance.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re, if all three of those things are lining up,</p>
<p>you may have an issue.</p>
<p>So performance wise,</p>
<p>a couple of little tests you can run.</p>
<p>Ideally you have some sort of standard workout you do.</p>
<p>Oh, and hopefully it&rsquo;s pretty objective.</p>
<p>So in other words, like I run the same 15 minute loop</p>
<p>every morning for my cardio.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>How long does it take you to run that loop?</p>
<p>Like you could pick whatever distance,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your heart rate during that thing?</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s your perceived exertion?</p>
<p>Now you should be able to do that fasted</p>
<p>with very little drop in performance.</p>
<p>Okay, if you can do that,</p>
<p>then that tells me you&rsquo;re fairly good</p>
<p>at using a fat as a fuel source.</p>
<p>If however, the one day you go to do your standard workout</p>
<p>and you feel awful fasting,</p>
<p>that may be another clue that perhaps</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not very good at dialing in that system.</p>
<p>If your recovery afterwards</p>
<p>in terms of heart rate recovery is very long,</p>
<p>it may be another clue that you have a poor utilization</p>
<p>of fat as a fuel source.</p>
<p>The inverse can also be true.</p>
<p>So if I give you something in the neighborhood</p>
<p>of like 50 or so grams of carbohydrate</p>
<p>and 30 minutes later, your face is falling off the table,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good sign that you&rsquo;re in the opposite.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually very, very, very poor</p>
<p>utilizing carbohydrate as a fuel.</p>
<p>And the reason I bring that up is that is equally a problem.</p>
<p>We hear people a lot make comments like,</p>
<p>man, I have to stay away from carbs.</p>
<p>I crash really hard if I do them.</p>
<p>What that actually means is you&rsquo;re very poor</p>
<p>at utilizing carbohydrates as fuel.</p>
<p>Your sensitivity is way off.</p>
<p>We should be able to have carbohydrate</p>
<p>at a reasonable dosage, 50 grams,</p>
<p>and not fall asleep 30 minutes later</p>
<p>or have to run to caffeine.</p>
<p>So that is a sign in our opinion.</p>
<p>This is, again, now just my practical brain telling you</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s a sign of dysfunction.</p>
<p>We should be able to have plenty of carbohydrates</p>
<p>through the day if we choose to,</p>
<p>if we want to for any reason.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if you were to throw 150 or 200 grams</p>
<p>of carbohydrate in your belly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to take a little bit of an energy hit</p>
<p>after that, but we should be able to have a reasonable dosage</p>
<p>and not have to fall asleep afterwards.</p>
<p>What is one way that people can enhance</p>
<p>their utilization of carbohydrates for exercise?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is I think I fall into that category.</p>
<p>I do consume some complex carbohydrates</p>
<p>and fruit post-resistance training.</p>
<p>And that tends to be when I&rsquo;m hungriest for them.</p>
<p>But typically, unless I&rsquo;ve just done some resistance training</p>
<p>I keep most of my daytime meals</p>
<p>relatively low carbohydrate.</p>
<p>And then in the evening, I prefer slightly less protein</p>
<p>and more carbohydrate because it has this effect</p>
<p>of sedating me a little bit and I sleep well.</p>
<p>And I know this runs against what everyone was taught,</p>
<p>which is to not eat carbohydrates late in the day.</p>
<p>But I like it because then I tend to wake up</p>
<p>in the morning with, at least as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>my glycogen stores, not necessarily topped off,</p>
<p>but certainly filled.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m able to train fasted in the morning.</p>
<p>And my favorite pre-workout consists of water</p>
<p>and caffeine and electrolytes</p>
<p>and maybe some supplementation as well.</p>
<p>But I love training fasted.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually a number of things.</p>
<p>One little sneaky thing you threw in there</p>
<p>is actually the use of caffeine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another sign.</p>
<p>If you have to have caffeine to do your fasted training,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generally another sign</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not very good at using fuel.</p>
<p>So I use caffeine prior to resistance training workouts.</p>
<p>Generally, I don&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>for any kind of cardiovascular training.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And when I say that, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like another clue that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, you should be able to do this</p>
<p>without having to have caffeine to execute it.</p>
<p>Now, using caffeine to get a better result</p>
<p>is sort of different as an ergogenic aid.</p>
<p>We actually use a lot of high carbohydrate meals</p>
<p>at the end of the day,</p>
<p>a lot of the times for our athletes who are cutting weight</p>
<p>or trying to reduce weight.</p>
<p>It is a fantastic way to handle a lot of things.</p>
<p>And that idea that if you eat carbs late at night,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll increase fat.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s all is so old</p>
<p>and so well destroyed scientifically</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not a concern.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much data showing.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s so much data on like eating timing</p>
<p>is generally poorly understood</p>
<p>about when you can eat and what you can&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>Eating in the morning versus eating at night.</p>
<p>Like a lot of what we&rsquo;ve heard in there is tough.</p>
<p>And maybe we just save that for sort of another day</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to get really far down</p>
<p>in this water we can dive into it.</p>
<p>Yes, I think our plan is to cover that</p>
<p>in an episode on nutrition, which is in this series.</p>
<p>The only thing that I would add to it is,</p>
<p>you know, when you hear about</p>
<p>ingesting carbohydrate late at night,</p>
<p>I should just say that at least in my case,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating the majority of my carbohydrate</p>
<p>unless I trained, resistance trained early in the day,</p>
<p>in which case I post resistance training.</p>
<p>In the last meal of the day,</p>
<p>but for me, that&rsquo;s not really late at night.</p>
<p>That last meal is somewhere between 6.30 and 7.30 PM.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s three or so hours or something like that</p>
<p>before you go to sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, I go to sleep around 10, 10.30 or so.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, you know, midnight bowls of pasta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that too, but typically it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So I think that people will be very interested,</p>
<p>myself included, in how meal timing relates to all of this,</p>
<p>but yeah, let&rsquo;s put that towards it.</p>
<p>So how do you improve fat utilization?</p>
<p>How do you improve carbohydrate utilization?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hammer both out really quickly.</p>
<p>Enhancing fat utilization is as simple</p>
<p>as doing a little bit of work</p>
<p>in a either pre-fat ingested state.</p>
<p>So anytime you ingest a nutrient prior to training,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to bias towards that nutrient, right?</p>
<p>Which is almost what we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>So if you want to guarantee you burn more fat,</p>
<p>eat more fat prior to a workout.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re not going to lose fat,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re effectively signaling</p>
<p>is we have an overabundance of this fuel.</p>
<p>Preferentially target this fuel.</p>
<p>Now the downside is that may actually</p>
<p>hinder your performance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s typically only a concern</p>
<p>for people at a very high level.</p>
<p>Fat is a slower fuel source.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re relying more upon that,</p>
<p>your top end is going to come down a little bit.</p>
<p>And so you wouldn&rsquo;t want to use that strategy prior to race</p>
<p>if it is a carbohydrate dependent race, right?</p>
<p>And in fact, we actually see long-term adaptations</p>
<p>that would suggest that.</p>
<p>So the enzymes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism</p>
<p>will down regulate.</p>
<p>And so you get worse at that.</p>
<p>So not a great strategy there.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate would be the opposite, right?</p>
<p>So if you have carbohydrate prior to exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to bias more towards that.</p>
<p>So a handful of things you can do.</p>
<p>If your total caloric intake is simply managed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to take care of a lot of these problems.</p>
<p>An appropriate eating strategy.</p>
<p>So the types of food, the combinations of food,</p>
<p>all of those things are going to make</p>
<p>your post-carbohydrate ingestion bonk.</p>
<p>A lot of those things can go away.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little bit of physiology</p>
<p>that has to be corrected for.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit&hellip;</p>
<p>In one hand, you can go very deep here, right?</p>
<p>So the real answer of how we would do this</p>
<p>is if we see a scenario like that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do a whole set of analyses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go full labs, right?</p>
<p>Extensive blood panel, urine, saliva, stool even.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to figure out</p>
<p>where is that glucose dysregulation coming from?</p>
<p>So a lot of people think like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s a metabolism issue.</p>
<p>It might be.</p>
<p>It also might just be a flag</p>
<p>that something else is happening in the body.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to actually work backwards a lot</p>
<p>to try to figure out exactly why that&rsquo;s occurring.</p>
<p>It may be as simple as,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re eating a lot of your carbohydrates</p>
<p>without any fiber or protein.</p>
<p>And we know that that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>because those will actually blunt the glycemic index,</p>
<p>like the rise in blood glucose.</p>
<p>So it could be a simple thing of just like,</p>
<p>oh, your combination of food is doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the total amount.</p>
<p>It may be something again,</p>
<p>more endogenous to the actual system.</p>
<p>It could be a heart rate issue.</p>
<p>It could be a breathing issue.</p>
<p>There could be a number of things.</p>
<p>So the way to get better at it is to simply train it.</p>
<p>And specificity is king here.</p>
<p>So if you want to get better</p>
<p>at managing your blood glucose throughout the day,</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not feeling those things,</p>
<p>it could be a fuel issue,</p>
<p>but it could be a number of other things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just hard to go into all of them</p>
<p>within our time constraint.</p>
<p>So the practical tool that I would say here is,</p>
<p>if you want to get better at managing energy</p>
<p>throughout the day,</p>
<p>make sure that number one, your protein is stabilized.</p>
<p>Make sure number two,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ingesting your food in the right combinations,</p>
<p>ideally with some fiber and or some protein or both.</p>
<p>That alone will help stabilize a lot of the problems.</p>
<p>Then you need to train at a high intensity.</p>
<p>You want to get better at using carbohydrates as a fuel,</p>
<p>train at a higher intensity</p>
<p>and have carbohydrates right before the workout.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do that a lot if we see folks who are,</p>
<p>I kind of walked you through the test of identifying</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not very good at using fat as a fuel.</p>
<p>The test for not being good at using carbohydrate as a fuel</p>
<p>is both that eating test I talked about,</p>
<p>as well as performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a very, very, very slow starter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like really hard to get going,</p>
<p>that generally indicates you might be in a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not very good at using carbohydrates as a fuel.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to practice that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have a pre-carbohydrate,</p>
<p>pre-exercise carbohydrate meal,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to do higher intensity stuff.</p>
<p>Not to the point of making you sick</p>
<p>and digestive issues, all that stuff,</p>
<p>but we want to get better at using carbohydrates</p>
<p>as a fuel faster.</p>
<p>If you want to get better at doing the opposite,</p>
<p>then you do that opposite strategy.</p>
<p>Either again, using fat prior to the workout,</p>
<p>knowing your peak performance</p>
<p>is going to go down a little bit,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re investing in adaptation, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about that workout.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what&rsquo;s going to happen six, eight, 10 weeks from now.</p>
<p>Investment is what you want to think about it.</p>
<p>Or you could bring in some fasted training.</p>
<p>And so I want to really make sure I clarify</p>
<p>when we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at all against fasted training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it works.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t required for fat loss.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t required for fat adaptation.</p>
<p>It is a great option though, if you want.</p>
<p>What I was hoping to do with that conversation</p>
<p>and maybe I didn&rsquo;t articulate that well</p>
<p>is to not restrict people, but is to open you up.</p>
<p>And at least you have a lot of options.</p>
<p>If you like to do fasted cardio, amazing, it is great.</p>
<p>If you hate it, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>You can reach the same performance goals,</p>
<p>the same physique goals without ever doing it.</p>
<p>If you love long duration steady state stuff, it is great.</p>
<p>If you hate it, there are other options,</p>
<p>higher intensity stuff.</p>
<p>Again, if we&rsquo;re just talking about fat loss.</p>
<p>So I hope now that that&rsquo;s a little clearer</p>
<p>in terms of the same thing in nutrition.</p>
<p>If you like higher carb, great.</p>
<p>If you like lower carb, these are all great.</p>
<p>You have options and you don&rsquo;t have to fret so much over,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, I have to do this thing a certain way</p>
<p>and I absolutely hate it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>Hit those concepts and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, you mentioned that</p>
<p>if we ingest a given macronutrient, like fat,</p>
<p>then the body will preferentially use that fuel source.</p>
<p>If you ingest carbohydrate, it will use that fuel source.</p>
<p>Is it always the case that the body uses</p>
<p>the ingested macronutrient prior to using glycogen?</p>
<p>I have to imagine it&rsquo;s using both.</p>
<p>I mean, if I were to have some carbohydrate</p>
<p>before doing any kind of training,</p>
<p>the muscles still burn glycogen, right?</p>
<p>Or do they have some way to register the amount</p>
<p>of circulating carbohydrate that would allow</p>
<p>or available carbohydrate in the form of foodstuffs</p>
<p>that would allow them to not tap</p>
<p>into their own muscle fiber stores of glycogen?</p>
<p>All right, so the way that we derive energy</p>
<p>for exercise or basic maintenance,</p>
<p>a little bit about cellular physiology.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a couple of organelle and structures</p>
<p>that we need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The first one is the nucleus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s holds your DNA.</p>
<p>The second one is the mitochondria.</p>
<p>And then everything outside of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got all these other organelle</p>
<p>that do a bunch of things like ribosomes</p>
<p>or protein synthesis, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>All right, now, when you wanna produce energy for exercise,</p>
<p>anytime you hear the word anaerobic,</p>
<p>you automatically understand</p>
<p>we are meaning without oxygen.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>That all happens in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>The cytoplasm is that space</p>
<p>that is not the mitochondria, not the nucleus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the space in between everything else.</p>
<p>This is like jelly-like substance that stands there.</p>
<p>So anaerobic metabolism happens there.</p>
<p>Every single aerobic metabolic process</p>
<p>happens in the mitochondria.</p>
<p>All right, why is that important?</p>
<p>If I go to create cellular energy</p>
<p>and I need it the fastest possible,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go for phosphocreatine</p>
<p>because it is stored directly in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>The stoichiometry is one-to-one there,</p>
<p>which means for every mole of phosphocreatine I burn,</p>
<p>I can create one ATP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one-to-one.</p>
<p>It is incredibly fast, but it is very limited</p>
<p>because think about it,</p>
<p>how much of that could I possibly store</p>
<p>in the small size of the cell?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>If I need energy past that point,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ll start using muscle glycogen</p>
<p>because that is also stored in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>So it is right there.</p>
<p>The stoichiometry is not one-to-one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit higher, probably like four-to-one.</p>
<p>So for every molecule of glycogen you burn,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get something like four-ish,</p>
<p>like some small number of ATP out of that,</p>
<p>which is great.</p>
<p>But again, you&rsquo;re running into a storage problem.</p>
<p>How much can I possibly store inside a muscle cell?</p>
<p>It is very, very fast,</p>
<p>much more effective than phosphocreatine, but so there.</p>
<p>If I then want to metabolize any form of fat,</p>
<p>or if I want to complete the metabolization</p>
<p>of carbohydrates,</p>
<p>I have to start transferring into the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Now I start getting whole hosts of ATP.</p>
<p>If you were to fully run through this thing,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a second,</p>
<p>called the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get now something like 28 or 30 or 35,</p>
<p>kind of depending, ATP per.</p>
<p>So the energetic output is much higher.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s exactly what happens.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to walk you through this</p>
<p>in the form of carbohydrate,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll come backwards and go through fat.</p>
<p>So remember, carbohydrate,</p>
<p>it is one carbon molecule that has been hydrated.</p>
<p>So it is one-to-one.</p>
<p>So the actual chemistry here,</p>
<p>it is CH2O, one carbon, 2H10.</p>
<p>Glucose is a six carbon chain.</p>
<p>So the chemistry here is C6H12O6,</p>
<p>six carbons, six waters.</p>
<p>Very simple, that&rsquo;s a carbohydrate.</p>
<p>All right, so you can imagine</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re watching on the video here,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see my fingers going nuts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to make sure I explain it to you all</p>
<p>just listening in an easy fashion.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this chain of six carbons</p>
<p>that is in front of you.</p>
<p>And the very first step to metabolism</p>
<p>is you snap that thing in half.</p>
<p>Right, so you break into two separate three carbon chains.</p>
<p>All right, now in doing that,</p>
<p>you got a little bit of energy</p>
<p>because you broke that one bond,</p>
<p>but not a tremendous amount.</p>
<p>This is called glycolysis.</p>
<p>So lysis being the split and glycogen,</p>
<p>like you split glycogen up,</p>
<p>got a little bit of energy of that.</p>
<p>All right, you form this three carbon chain</p>
<p>called pyruvate or pyruvic acid.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s differences there,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t kill me.</p>
<p>General audience, friends.</p>
<p>All right, I gotta give this,</p>
<p>communicate this to everybody.</p>
<p>So you got a little bit of that.</p>
<p>Now you can&rsquo;t do much past that</p>
<p>besides rip one more carbon</p>
<p>off of each of those three carbon chains.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got two, three carbon chains.</p>
<p>I gotta be careful how I do this with my fingers</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t flip you off here in a second.</p>
<p>But I burn one more off of each.</p>
<p>I get a little bit of energy</p>
<p>and now that little two carbon chain,</p>
<p>I have two, two carbon chains,</p>
<p>those are called acetyl-CoA.</p>
<p>All right, amazing.</p>
<p>I have now completed anaerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got really nothing left I can do here.</p>
<p>I made a little bit of ATP.</p>
<p>Now, wait a minute.</p>
<p>I have now freed two carbons</p>
<p>because remember I started with six</p>
<p>and I split them apart,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t, I had two, three carbon chains.</p>
<p>I burned one each.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two free floating carbons.</p>
<p>I have to now do something with them.</p>
<p>My body will not let me go through that last process</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;ve got a plan for that free carbon</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t break it in half.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>If I have those three carbon molecules</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have anywhere I can put that carbon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to go through that process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to stop it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start building up pyruvate.</p>
<p>Now, at the same time, you&rsquo;re breaking ATP for fuel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called ATP hydrolysis, right?</p>
<p>You have water that comes in,</p>
<p>you have an adenosine and three phosphates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called ATP,</p>
<p>adenosine triphosphate, one, two, three.</p>
<p>You break one of those phosphates off.</p>
<p>There you go, there&rsquo;s your energy.</p>
<p>So now you have a free floating inorganic phosphate</p>
<p>and an adenosine diphosphate, so two over there.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>That actually results because you use water for it,</p>
<p>results in a free floating hydrogen ion.</p>
<p>Okay, you just have to trust me, hydrogen H2O.</p>
<p>Any idea what a free floating hydrogen is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s acid.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was gonna say it&rsquo;s gonna increase acidity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what acidity is.</p>
<p>For anyone that&rsquo;s ever measured pH,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really measuring is the amount of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Potential hydrogen, that&rsquo;s what pH is, right?</p>
<p>100%, there&rsquo;s two definitions of pH,</p>
<p>but you get it, that&rsquo;s one of the two.</p>
<p>So is this, are you gonna tell me</p>
<p>this is related to the burn?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get close, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of free floating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the phosphates, which are actually a problem,</p>
<p>two, probably more of a problem than people realize,</p>
<p>and that hydrogen.</p>
<p>What are you going to do with that hydrogen?</p>
<p>Well, one thing you can do is actually ship it over</p>
<p>to pyruvate and bond it there.</p>
<p>We have a special name for that little molecule</p>
<p>when you have pyruvate and you have hydrogen attached to it.</p>
<p>Do you know what it&rsquo;s called?</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide?</p>
<p>Lactate.</p>
<p>Lactate, lactic acid, this is that whole system, right?</p>
<p>Again, I was skipping some steps,</p>
<p>making a little bit of mistakes here,</p>
<p>intentionally folks, just to make this assumed.</p>
<p>So what happens when you start running</p>
<p>a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis?</p>
<p>You start seeing massive rises in lactate.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Not lactic acid.</p>
<p>Right, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we see associations</p>
<p>between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue,</p>
<p>but the lactate is actually not causing the fatigue.</p>
<p>The lactate is actually sparing you</p>
<p>from having a bunch of free floating acid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also can be then used directly back in the muscle</p>
<p>because as soon as you bring in enough oxygen</p>
<p>and you can take that hydrogen back off of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve now turned it right back into pyruvate</p>
<p>and you can run it through this whole cycle</p>
<p>as fuel that I&rsquo;m about to do.</p>
<p>You can actually actually ship it</p>
<p>out of the exercising muscle</p>
<p>and ship it into a non-exercising muscle</p>
<p>and then go backwards and make glucose.</p>
<p>What actually liberates hydrogen from lactate?</p>
<p>You mean like chemically?</p>
<p>Yeah, so what liberates,</p>
<p>well, what are the stimuli that can take hydrogen</p>
<p>off the pyruvate?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>And then in other words,</p>
<p>to reduce lactate and free up that hydrogen.</p>
<p>Oxygen availability.</p>
<p>So in fact, one of the major places</p>
<p>that you ship hydrogen to,</p>
<p>or one of the major places that you ship lactate to</p>
<p>is your heart,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what we call the ultimate slow touch fiber.</p>
<p>And it has a ton of freely available mitochondria,</p>
<p>which have a ton of access to oxygen</p>
<p>so it can actually then go to it, form water.</p>
<p>The H2O can be used to form water</p>
<p>and now we have a place to store the hydrogen.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So as a result of anaerobic glycolysis,</p>
<p>we have made a little bit of ATP.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created a lot of waste</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have anywhere to go with these end products.</p>
<p>So when you do anything of a higher intensity</p>
<p>and it says, I need energy fast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go to this system first, right?</p>
<p>Right past ATP,</p>
<p>because it is the fastest place to get energy,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna get much of it</p>
<p>and you got to deal with the waste products.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Right back to the beginning of our conversation.</p>
<p>Endurance is about two things,</p>
<p>energy production and waste management.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re right, we&rsquo;re fatigue buffering.</p>
<p>This is it, right?</p>
<p>How well can you handle the elevations in hydrogen,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Drop in pH.</p>
<p>And then what are you gonna do with these products?</p>
<p>If you want to fully metabolize a carbohydrate,</p>
<p>you then have to do something with those pyruvates</p>
<p>or those acetyl-CoAs,</p>
<p>which are going to do,</p>
<p>if oxygen is available,</p>
<p>you will take those things</p>
<p>and ship them into the mitochondria.</p>
<p>They have to go through some cell walls</p>
<p>and some other things like that,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to get inside there.</p>
<p>Once they&rsquo;re in there,</p>
<p>that two carbon acetyl-CoA</p>
<p>runs through this entire cycle</p>
<p>that we call the Krebs cycle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s this really interesting place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where B6 and NMN,</p>
<p>people are like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where that whole stuff starts to kick in.</p>
<p>All your B vitamins basically run that entire circle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna start off at the top.</p>
<p>You have a bunch of fun stuff going on,</p>
<p>but as a part of that circle,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna pull off some hydrogen ions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna send these</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s called the electron transport chain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re gonna get a ton of ATP out of.</p>
<p>And as a result,</p>
<p>about halfway through the turn,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna pull off one carbon</p>
<p>and about halfway through the other,</p>
<p>almost the other way to the finish,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna pull off the second carbon.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna take the second acetyl-CoA,</p>
<p>run that entire thing,</p>
<p>same through as well.</p>
<p>And so what we did is we started off</p>
<p>with a six carbon glucose chain.</p>
<p>We split it in half.</p>
<p>We call those pyruvate.</p>
<p>We made a little bit of energy</p>
<p>because we broke that one bond</p>
<p>of those two carbons that are in the middle.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Those two, three carbon molecules,</p>
<p>we pulled one carbon off of each.</p>
<p>We brought in,</p>
<p>sorry, we moved those into the mitochondria.</p>
<p>We brought one off.</p>
<p>We took a breath,</p>
<p>brought in some oxygen,</p>
<p>bonded that,</p>
<p>took out two CO2 exhales.</p>
<p>We ran the acetyl-CoA through the Krebs cycle.</p>
<p>One, two carbons per turn coming out of CO2.</p>
<p>So we had six carbons total as we started</p>
<p>and we exited with zero carbons.</p>
<p>Now we have fully metabolized</p>
<p>a molecule of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>That required an anaerobic start</p>
<p>and an aerobic finish.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of mitochondria,</p>
<p>large mitochondria,</p>
<p>high functioning mitochondria,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to limit your anaerobic performance</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to get,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna run that door full very, very quickly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go past it</p>
<p>because hydrogen will build up way too fast.</p>
<p>And one of the things that we know</p>
<p>is both temperature and pH run enzyme function.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to stop.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t even be able to run through,</p>
<p>in fact, that ATP hydrolysis phase.</p>
<p>Even if I gave you a whole infinite supply of ATP,</p>
<p>if I put enough acid in there,</p>
<p>it would stop working</p>
<p>because the ATPase enzyme needed to split.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be able to run</p>
<p>in a highly acidic environment or a hot environment.</p>
<p>Yeah, at some point,</p>
<p>perhaps today,</p>
<p>perhaps in the future discussion,</p>
<p>but still not too far from now,</p>
<p>we could talk about the role of temperature</p>
<p>in pyruvate in terms of its regulation</p>
<p>of muscle contraction.</p>
<p>But I want to make sure I understood something correctly.</p>
<p>You mentioned these two parallel fuel systems, right?</p>
<p>One is essentially anaerobic, right?</p>
<p>And the other is aerobic.</p>
<p>You said that if we can&rsquo;t pull enough,</p>
<p>if we can&rsquo;t break enough bonds,</p>
<p>then we limit our anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I would have thought,</p>
<p>given that the mitochondria are the site</p>
<p>for essentially for aerobic metabolism,</p>
<p>that we would be limiting our aerobic capacity as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could just clarify for me</p>
<p>how these two things are divided</p>
<p>or is there not a clean division?</p>
<p>Is it not an either or?</p>
<p>No, in fact, again,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to think of these things</p>
<p>rather as two separate parallel things as one big cycle.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re one gear turning the next.</p>
<p>Being compromised in one will compromise the other.</p>
<p>That, I should say,</p>
<p>reminds me of what you said earlier,</p>
<p>which is the bicycle gear analogy.</p>
<p>That works great.</p>
<p>So if you short circuit one,</p>
<p>basically the chain can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Okay, so indeed they are running in parallel,</p>
<p>but they are interdependent.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they&rsquo;re actually not even running in parallel</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re actually funneling to the same endpoint,</p>
<p>right, which is like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to come from the anaerobic glycolysis route</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to come from the fat route,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a second,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re both going to be limited in the mitochondria.</p>
<p>So when that thing&rsquo;s full, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run either system, right?</p>
<p>So it is more of like a,</p>
<p>again, if you&rsquo;re running the bike gears,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if the back one&rsquo;s larger or smaller</p>
<p>because if either one is limited, you&rsquo;re toast</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re running on the same system.</p>
<p>You can sneak a little bit here and there, but not much.</p>
<p>You also really nicely highlighted how lactate,</p>
<p>this thing that we think of as a limiting factor,</p>
<p>like the burn, it gets in the way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the thing where you need to stop</p>
<p>and buffer and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really a fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tremendously effective fuel.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a strongly preferred fuel, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, this is a very classic case</p>
<p>of association, correlation versus causation, right?</p>
<p>So the original actually,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a really cool history on lactate,</p>
<p>but it was originally found, I think in Germany,</p>
<p>pardon my history there,</p>
<p>somewhere in Europe in hunted stags.</p>
<p>So one of the things is they sort of realized</p>
<p>is like if we harvested a stag in a rest state</p>
<p>when it didn&rsquo;t know we were there</p>
<p>versus if we chased it and it was ran down,</p>
<p>that these lactate concentrations were significantly higher</p>
<p>in the latter situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, lactate started immediately getting</p>
<p>this association between high fatigue points.</p>
<p>It is easy to measure.</p>
<p>If you do any sort of lactate test,</p>
<p>any sort of metabolic test,</p>
<p>you will see as fatigue increases,</p>
<p>lactate will also increase.</p>
<p>The assumption there was then, oh my gosh, it&rsquo;s the cause.</p>
<p>Now we know like, again, it&rsquo;s not the thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in large part trying to buffer</p>
<p>the negative consequences of ATP hydrolysis</p>
<p>and some other things.</p>
<p>So it is certainly playing a part in that role,</p>
<p>but it is not the core driver.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why you don&rsquo;t need to worry</p>
<p>about doing things to, quote unquote,</p>
<p>reduce lactate in the muscle after exercise</p>
<p>or to clear lactate or any of those things.</p>
<p>You may still wanna do those activities,</p>
<p>but not for that reason.</p>
<p>Lactate&rsquo;s fine, you&rsquo;re actually gonna use it</p>
<p>in, again, the neighboring exercise muscle fibers</p>
<p>in the same muscle.</p>
<p>Another muscle, you can send it actually to the liver</p>
<p>and it can actually go through gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>and it can actually replenish liver glycogen</p>
<p>just as a fuel source,</p>
<p>or you can send it to the heart or any number of sources.</p>
<p>You can also just kind of put it in circulation,</p>
<p>put it back in the muscle,</p>
<p>and once enough oxygen is there,</p>
<p>you can just kick it right back</p>
<p>into either glucose or glycogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>So it is obviously clear though,</p>
<p>once that number gets very, very high,</p>
<p>other things are going to be happening</p>
<p>that are gonna be causing a lot of hurt.</p>
<p>And this is your managing waste, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an issue of managing</p>
<p>what am I gonna do with all this extra carbon?</p>
<p>What am I gonna do with all this extra inorganic phosphate</p>
<p>and some other nasty byproducts?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing you have to deal with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to teach me</p>
<p>how different ratios of fuel sources are used</p>
<p>depending on how long I happen to be exercising.</p>
<p>For example, if I do a very short bout of exercise,</p>
<p>typically that&rsquo;s correlated with a higher intensity output.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose I could jog for one minute,</p>
<p>but here I&rsquo;m thinking about sprinting for one minute or less.</p>
<p>Which fuels are used?</p>
<p>Is that mainly driven by fat,</p>
<p>by carbohydrate stores?</p>
<p>Is it driven by dietary fat preferentially</p>
<p>or carbohydrate that I&rsquo;ve ingested</p>
<p>if indeed I&rsquo;ve ingested those or protein for that matter.</p>
<p>And then as we transition to exercise</p>
<p>that goes a little bit longer,</p>
<p>anywhere from three to five minutes,</p>
<p>how do those ratios change?</p>
<p>And as we transition to longer duration,</p>
<p>what most people think of as endurance exercise,</p>
<p>but long duration output of 20 minutes or more</p>
<p>leading all the way up to a full marathon.</p>
<p>How does that change the ratio</p>
<p>of fuel sources that are used?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be particularly interested</p>
<p>in distinguishing between carbohydrate,</p>
<p>fat and protein that&rsquo;s ingested.</p>
<p>So coming from food sources</p>
<p>or carbohydrate, fat and protein</p>
<p>that are coming from storage sites within the body.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start at zero seconds</p>
<p>and run all the way through marathon.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll flag the distinctions where they start changing.</p>
<p>As soon as you want to create muscle contraction and power,</p>
<p>the very first source of energy is phosphocreatine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna power you for zero to maybe say eight</p>
<p>to 15, 20 seconds of maximal exertion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s coming from the muscle fibers themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is actually stored</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>So this is a little area or space in the muscle fiber</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of like in this jelly-like substance.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice because one molecule of phosphocreatine</p>
<p>gives you one molecule of ATP.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a big energy output,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very fast because it is stored right there</p>
<p>in the local exercising muscle, right?</p>
<p>Now, if you need energy past that point,</p>
<p>say 10 or 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>this is now you&rsquo;re gonna have to transition</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna burn through that phosphocreatine</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to move to now carbohydrate metabolism.</p>
<p>This is what we call anaerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two phases of glycolysis.</p>
<p>Glycolysis itself means glucose burning, all right?</p>
<p>So it just means we&rsquo;re using carbohydrate as a fuel source.</p>
<p>So initially, when we start off this cascade,</p>
<p>which is gonna take us again for a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>carbohydrate utilization comes first</p>
<p>from the exercising muscle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very similar to phosphocreatine that way.</p>
<p>If you start running low on it,</p>
<p>you can actually start pulling blood glucose.</p>
<p>And if blood glucose gets low,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to start getting glycogen from the liver</p>
<p>to keep that up.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve sort of covered that conversation.</p>
<p>All right, so a little bit of chemistry here,</p>
<p>just give me a little bit of room here.</p>
<p>So now remember a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule</p>
<p>that has been hydrated.</p>
<p>So one carbon attached to one water,</p>
<p>and remember water is H2O.</p>
<p>Most of the time when we&rsquo;re talking about glucose,</p>
<p>it is in a six carbon chain.</p>
<p>So six carbons attached to six water molecules.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>When I go to split this up through anaerobic glycolysis,</p>
<p>it works a little bit like this.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this six carbon chain.</p>
<p>The first step is to snap that thing in half.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna make two, three carbon chains.</p>
<p>Now we broke one bond right there,</p>
<p>so we got a little bit of energy,</p>
<p>but not a tremendous amount.</p>
<p>At the end of anaerobic glycolysis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna net something like three or four ATP.</p>
<p>So more than you get from the phosphocreatine.</p>
<p>Triple or quadruple, but still not very much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another major downside that&rsquo;s coming in a second</p>
<p>to this system.</p>
<p>The upside is it&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>Actually, one adaptation we get to training in this style</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ll increase your ability</p>
<p>to store glycogen in your muscle.</p>
<p>Which is great, right?</p>
<p>We can actually biopsy you and measure the amount</p>
<p>that you store, and a training adaptation is awesome.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to sustain this system longer.</p>
<p>So perhaps 90 seconds into your interval training,</p>
<p>you hit a fatigue point,</p>
<p>and now you maybe can extend that to 100 or 115 seconds</p>
<p>simply because you&rsquo;re storing more glycogen in the muscle.</p>
<p>Before we have to then go into the blood</p>
<p>and get it in the form of glucose.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got this six carbon molecule,</p>
<p>and we split this in half.</p>
<p>We got that little bit of ATP.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re in this little tricky position</p>
<p>because this three carbon molecule</p>
<p>is what we call pyruvate, pyruvic acid.</p>
<p>And again, chemistry folks, I&rsquo;m skipping some steps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna intentionally make some mistakes here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making sure the entire world listening,</p>
<p>regardless of where they come in, can follow me here, okay?</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t burn me on the details.</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;ve got this pyruvate.</p>
<p>The problem is you can no longer do anything</p>
<p>with that glycolysis is over.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta make a choice, right?</p>
<p>In order to make something</p>
<p>out of those three carbon molecules,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to ship them to the mitochondria.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve said, that is the only place of aerobic metabolism.</p>
<p>Right, we cannot do aerobic metabolism anywhere else</p>
<p>until we enter the mitochondria.</p>
<p>So anytime we cross that barrier,</p>
<p>we know we&rsquo;ve automatically switched</p>
<p>from anaerobic to aerobic.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>If you were to take one more carbon</p>
<p>off that three carbon pyruvate,</p>
<p>you have to now do something with that carbon waste, okay?</p>
<p>So before when we split the six carbon chain,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t actually leave any carbons free-floating.</p>
<p>We just split a two molecule in half.</p>
<p>When we go to split from pyruvate</p>
<p>and make it into this two carbon molecule</p>
<p>called acetyl-CoA or acyl-CoA,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;ve got a free-floating carbon.</p>
<p>We have to have a strategy for that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to increase the acidity level.</p>
<p>Any enzyme in our body that works to create fuel</p>
<p>is very pH sensitive, right?</p>
<p>So if this thing, if pH gets off either high or low,</p>
<p>these enzymes can&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, really important</p>
<p>because even if I were to give you a direct injection</p>
<p>of ATP, remember that&rsquo;s that energy currency,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way we can actually form energy.</p>
<p>I guess remember to clarify,</p>
<p>anytime we&rsquo;re using phosphocreatine or glucose or fat,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll get to a second,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not actually getting energy for exercise</p>
<p>by breaking those down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting energy that we can use to then make ATP.</p>
<p>We break that ATP down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s actually powering muscle contraction.</p>
<p>You can go back to our previous episode</p>
<p>where we walked you through the detail</p>
<p>of the muscle contraction.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re after, okay?</p>
<p>So in the case of pyruvate,</p>
<p>if we split that off, we have got to deal with that.</p>
<p>And the only way and the best way</p>
<p>we can deal with that is oxygen.</p>
<p>Remember, we&rsquo;re going to breathe in O2.</p>
<p>That O2 is going to combine with that free-floating carbon,</p>
<p>make CO2, we&rsquo;re going to exhale that thing out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our waste management strategy.</p>
<p>But that has to happen in the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Remember, if we&rsquo;re using oxygen,</p>
<p>it has to be in the mitochondria.</p>
<p>So if we have the ability to ship pyruvate</p>
<p>into the mitochondria, we&rsquo;re golden.</p>
<p>But what happens if we don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Why do we not?</p>
<p>Well, if we don&rsquo;t have enough mitochondria</p>
<p>or our mitochondria are too small or they&rsquo;re too far away,</p>
<p>or we don&rsquo;t have sufficient oxygen availability.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have sufficient oxygen availability?</p>
<p>Because we created the pyruvate too fast.</p>
<p>And the demand in the mitochondria is exceeded</p>
<p>by the buildup of pyruvate.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re having this giant backlog</p>
<p>and this thing fills up fast.</p>
<p>We have a couple of strategies here.</p>
<p>Well, when you&rsquo;re going through ATP and you&rsquo;re splitting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called ATP hydrolysis.</p>
<p>Of doing that, remember ATP is an adenosine molecule</p>
<p>and then the T part is triphosphate, one, two, three,</p>
<p>which means you have three phosphates attached at the end.</p>
<p>When you break that phosphate off,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you get your energy.</p>
<p>So now you have an inorganic phosphate</p>
<p>and an ADP, adenosine diphosphate, two.</p>
<p>That process requires water, it&rsquo;s called hydrolysis.</p>
<p>As a result of that, you then have a free floating hydrogen.</p>
<p>And as you well know, that is acid, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s potential hydrogen, that&rsquo;s what that means.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve increased the acidity in the muscle</p>
<p>by breaking up all this ATP.</p>
<p>And so, uh-oh, we&rsquo;re building up acid,</p>
<p>we are building up pyruvate,</p>
<p>we have nowhere to go with it,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t cleave off a carbon</p>
<p>because now we&rsquo;re just gonna exacerbate the acid increase.</p>
<p>So what we can do is we can take those hydrogens</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re building up and store them on the pyruvate.</p>
<p>A pyruvate that&rsquo;s holding an extra acid</p>
<p>has a special name and we call that lactate, all right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we see this buildup of lactate.</p>
<p>So one of the downsides of anaerobic glycolysis</p>
<p>is an incredibly high rate of waste production.</p>
<p>Now, lactate is not the cause of fatigue.</p>
<p>In fact, if you think a little bit more carefully</p>
<p>about what I just said, it&rsquo;s actually stopping you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we call a acid buffer.</p>
<p>You can actually use it for a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>You can ship it to a neighboring muscle fiber</p>
<p>in the same muscle that&rsquo;s not working,</p>
<p>you can ship it to the liver,</p>
<p>you can ship it to the heart and a bunch of other places,</p>
<p>and then you can actually just work backwards.</p>
<p>So if you ship it to, for example, the heart</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got a bunch of mitochondria that are free,</p>
<p>you can bring in the oxygen,</p>
<p>attach it to that hydrogen, make water,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re right back to pyruvate.</p>
<p>You put two pyruvate back together</p>
<p>and now you just make glucose.</p>
<p>So you can actually store it in the liver.</p>
<p>This is a process called gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>through this fancy thing called the Cori cycle,</p>
<p>which is what the proper cycle here is.</p>
<p>So you can use it as a very potent fuel source.</p>
<p>In fact, lactate is a tremendously valuable fuel source,</p>
<p>not only for exercise, but for cognition</p>
<p>and a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>So lactate, in fact, this is why,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve seen any of the research</p>
<p>about pre-exam testing exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a noticeable increase in exam scores</p>
<p>if you do a 20-metabyte of exercise prior to taking the exam.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s largely in part probably</p>
<p>because of things like elevations in lactate.</p>
<p>How intense of exercise would be most beneficial?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that exact answer.</p>
<p>I just know that generally any form of exercise is good,</p>
<p>but if you were to reach a reasonably high heart rate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to see&hellip;</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s an acute and chronic adaptation here.</p>
<p>So folks that exercise have better memory retention,</p>
<p>scores in exams, et cetera,</p>
<p>but then also doing it prior to that exam,</p>
<p>make sure you recovered and rested back down to straight,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll generally perform better.</p>
<p>I had a previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a psychology professor and neuroscientist</p>
<p>and also Dean of College of Arts and Sciences</p>
<p>at New York University, NYU.</p>
<p>Wendy Suzuki is religious about daily morning exercise</p>
<p>specifically for this purpose</p>
<p>of enhancing learning and memory</p>
<p>and has a lot of really beautiful data.</p>
<p>I consider her one of the real pioneers in this space.</p>
<p>So if people want to learn more,</p>
<p>they can look to that episode or Wendy&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>We can provide a link to a couple of the papers,</p>
<p>but this is fantastic in that it&rsquo;s incredibly clear.</p>
<p>I think for the first time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m understanding what lactate is really doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s dispelling a lot of myths</p>
<p>that I think I and a lot of other people</p>
<p>arrived to the discussion about lactate with.</p>
<p>What happens when the bout of exercise extends longer?</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So if we want to continue past that point,</p>
<p>we have to have some sort of strategy</p>
<p>to get through it, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stuck, we&rsquo;re out of gas.</p>
<p>We have to then ship it to the mitochondria.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to enter</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called aerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>And this is going to take us anywhere from,</p>
<p>again, say that 90 seconds of all that work</p>
<p>up to really 20, 30 minutes.</p>
<p>In fact, it really will take us to unlimited.</p>
<p>If you look at a highly competitive marathon runner,</p>
<p>even those that are running, say your two-hour marathon,</p>
<p>those folks are burning up to 80% carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It is not a fat burning thing.</p>
<p>And the reason is fat metabolism is way too slow.</p>
<p>It provides a lot of energy, but it is incredibly slow.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to run a four and a half</p>
<p>or so minute mile repeated 26 times,</p>
<p>you have to be moving fast.</p>
<p>Are they ingesting carbohydrate</p>
<p>as a fuel source during the race?</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re on the team, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t really tell you.</p>
<p>These are sort of trade secrets.</p>
<p>It would be, I would say, fairly rare to not have something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different strategies.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go really long,</p>
<p>like some of these, like cycling,</p>
<p>where the races will be several hours,</p>
<p>then you actually might go to some fat as fuel sources.</p>
<p>I know a lot of cyclists are using ketones</p>
<p>and things like that now.</p>
<p>But traditionally, most endurance folks</p>
<p>are going to bias heavily towards carbohydrate.</p>
<p>Now, in one respect,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to run out of carbohydrates</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re many hours in.</p>
<p>These folks are a unique case,</p>
<p>but the average individual who&rsquo;s doing an hour,</p>
<p>hour and a half cardio even,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be limited by your carbohydrate stores.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be just fine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be limited by some other things,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll maybe sort of break down here in a second,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to be fine there.</p>
<p>A lot of those folks will take carbohydrate,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have very specific intervals.</p>
<p>You do want to be careful though</p>
<p>of ingesting too many fast carbohydrates</p>
<p>prior to your exercise spout.</p>
<p>We actually have this little thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the insulin glucose double whammy.</p>
<p>And what that means is when you ingest carbohydrates,</p>
<p>immediately your blood glucose goes up</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s depending on the type of carbohydrate</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>Well, the same thing happens with exercise.</p>
<p>And so what happens is insulin wants to start</p>
<p>pulling glucose out of the blood.</p>
<p>At the same time, muscle wants to start pulling glucose</p>
<p>out of the blood.</p>
<p>And so we have this giant bolus of carbohydrate come in</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden our blood sugar crashes.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re going to be doing so</p>
<p>your first half marathon or something like that,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in those giant corrals</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like a hundred people waiting to go</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re standing there for 45 minutes,</p>
<p>you may or may not want to slug down</p>
<p>like three or four bananas and a bagel and honey.</p>
<p>And you probably don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>Now, not everyone experiences this double whammy,</p>
<p>but it has been shown in the literature</p>
<p>to happen to some people.</p>
<p>So you want to just be a little bit careful.</p>
<p>An easy way to combat that is just practice</p>
<p>exactly what you&rsquo;re going to do in your race</p>
<p>in your training.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the simplest advice ever,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d be stunned how many people do things</p>
<p>during the race that they&rsquo;ve actually never done in training.</p>
<p>I suggest people do exactly what you described</p>
<p>also for any kind of cognitive testing.</p>
<p>Before a big exam is not the time to discover</p>
<p>whether or not you can handle twice as much espresso</p>
<p>or take a nootropic for the first time or change anything.</p>
<p>I mean, if indeed the score on that exam</p>
<p>is meaningful to you, keep things regular.</p>
<p>So to recap, what we&rsquo;ve done here</p>
<p>is we started off in the cytoplasm</p>
<p>with this glucose molecule that has six carbons.</p>
<p>We took that thing, we split it in half.</p>
<p>We call that thing anaerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>We made a little bit of energy, but not much.</p>
<p>We take those three carbon molecules,</p>
<p>we ship them into the mitochondria.</p>
<p>We take each one of those, we clear off one carbon each.</p>
<p>Those carbons, we take a breath in,</p>
<p>we attach them to oxygen, we exhale them,</p>
<p>get rid of that energy.</p>
<p>We are now fully into aerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>Each one of those two carbon molecules,</p>
<p>we run through the Krebs cycle.</p>
<p>Each round of the Krebs cycle burns one, two carbons.</p>
<p>So we go one, two, one, two.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;ve gone from six carbon molecule</p>
<p>all the way down to zero.</p>
<p>We used the hydrogens that we pulled off of that</p>
<p>Krebs cycle run to go to the electron transport chain.</p>
<p>From there, we made a whole bunch of ATP.</p>
<p>And so we have now fully metabolized</p>
<p>one molecule of carbohydrate.</p>
<p>And the end product of all of it is simply ATP,</p>
<p>water, and CO2.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>And leads me to the conclusion that</p>
<p>most everything is really about utilization of carbons</p>
<p>and exhaling CO2.</p>
<p>Is that how I should think about bookending</p>
<p>what you just described?</p>
<p>This is why we started off the conversation</p>
<p>with the circle of life.</p>
<p>This is really a carbon game.</p>
<p>This is why we call chemistry with carbon,</p>
<p>organic chemistry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this whole thing is about.</p>
<p>Any living being has to run through metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a carbon game.</p>
<p>Any living being has to use ATP.</p>
<p>This is all just a big fancy game</p>
<p>of how do I make ATP and handle the waste?</p>
<p>Remember, endurance is all about waste management,</p>
<p>fatigue resistance, the same thing,</p>
<p>and energy production.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing a game here.</p>
<p>The whole game, bring in energy, use it,</p>
<p>mitigate waste products.</p>
<p>So when thinking about aerobic exercise</p>
<p>or long duration exercise,</p>
<p>in this case, anything longer than five minutes</p>
<p>for that matter, five minutes all the way up</p>
<p>to an ultramarathon,</p>
<p>the breathing associated with endurance exercise,</p>
<p>the heart beating, which of course is associated</p>
<p>with the breathing and vice versa,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really all about bringing oxygen into the system</p>
<p>that then allows those carbons to be used</p>
<p>within the mitochondria specifically</p>
<p>and then carbon dioxide to be exhaled</p>
<p>as we work through the carbons</p>
<p>of the sort of beads on a string.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re moving incredibly fast</p>
<p>for a very long time,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking probably north of 90 minutes,</p>
<p>endurance is really not a game</p>
<p>of making sure I have enough fuel.</p>
<p>It is simply managing the waste production.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what you described.</p>
<p>You need to bring in the oxygen</p>
<p>so you can handle the carbon that&rsquo;s building up</p>
<p>as a result of both the anaerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our game here.</p>
<p>If we start talking about endurance events longer than that,</p>
<p>now we do have to start worrying</p>
<p>about running out of muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>running out of liver glycogen, et cetera,</p>
<p>or if we are at that two hour mark or so</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re moving very, very, very fast.</p>
<p>But anything south of that is just managing carbon buildup</p>
<p>and we do that best through oxygen utilization</p>
<p>or getting more efficient</p>
<p>and having a higher capacity for our anaerobic side.</p>
<p>So we can do that by having either more glycogen</p>
<p>in our muscle so that lasts longer</p>
<p>or building better acid buffering systems.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole line of supplementation</p>
<p>that are specifically acid buffers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole line of training.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole line of breathing to manage this step.</p>
<p>So we have a lot of strategies</p>
<p>where we can maximize endurance.</p>
<p>All we have to do is go back</p>
<p>to the earlier part of our talk,</p>
<p>which is figure out what&rsquo;s the actual limiting step</p>
<p>and then train according to that</p>
<p>or do your strategy, your nutrition, your supplementation</p>
<p>that defeats that limiting factor.</p>
<p>For an example, if you are trying</p>
<p>to maximize your performance in this 22nd maximal burst</p>
<p>and your strategy for that was to make sure</p>
<p>that your muscle glycogen is saturated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not going to help a ton</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to be limited by total fuel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be limited by your ability to buffer acid.</p>
<p>However, storing more glycogen in your muscle</p>
<p>in preparation for a marathon</p>
<p>is a tremendously effective strategy</p>
<p>because that will become a limiting factor.</p>
<p>So what we can do actually next if you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>is we can just walk through these</p>
<p>and look at the individual limitations</p>
<p>where the failure point happens</p>
<p>and then that effectively will outline your strategy</p>
<p>for improving them.</p>
<p>So you taught us about carbohydrate utilization</p>
<p>as a fuel source.</p>
<p>What about fat and what about protein?</p>
<p>Great, I&rsquo;ll start with protein because it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>It is generally at best going to represent 10%</p>
<p>of your energy output.</p>
<p>Now that will grow over time</p>
<p>in terms of if you did a several hour amount of exercise.</p>
<p>When you started doing it,</p>
<p>you might be using 5% of your energy from protein</p>
<p>and then that might grow to 10 or so.</p>
<p>And that happens</p>
<p>because you start running low on muscle glycogen.</p>
<p>You start running low on liver glycogen.</p>
<p>You start then having to pull in energy from another place.</p>
<p>So like as those numbers go down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see an increased uptick of energy from fat</p>
<p>as well as protein.</p>
<p>Having said that, it&rsquo;s not a tremendous fuel source.</p>
<p>It is only aerobic.</p>
<p>So it has to be oxidized.</p>
<p>Those are the same thing.</p>
<p>When I say oxidized,</p>
<p>you use oxygen to burn something to make a fuel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a significant contributor</p>
<p>to energy in that regard.</p>
<p>And unless you&rsquo;re talking ultramarathons or longer</p>
<p>and it is also not something that can enhance performance.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t really need to talk much more</p>
<p>about it than that.</p>
<p>In terms of fat as a fuel source,</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s the fundamental difference.</p>
<p>While carbohydrate starts anaerobically</p>
<p>and finishes aerobically in the mitochondria,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using mostly the carbohydrate</p>
<p>in the exercising muscle tissue.</p>
<p>Eventually you can pull from blood</p>
<p>and then you can pull from the liver.</p>
<p>With fat, you have a tiny amount stored in the muscle,</p>
<p>intramuscular triglycerides.</p>
<p>But the overwhelming majority of fuel you get from fat</p>
<p>comes systemically.</p>
<p>And so now we have a fundamental difference.</p>
<p>We actually literally have a time problem.</p>
<p>I can get energy from carbohydrates faster</p>
<p>because it is directly there.</p>
<p>If I go to pull it from fat,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to pull it from the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Which is why somebody who loses fat</p>
<p>loses it from their entire body.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that they may be only exercising</p>
<p>a couple of parts.</p>
<p>So think about a runner.</p>
<p>Someone who lost a lot of fat running.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see them just lose fat in their legs.</p>
<p>It comes from their face and their neck and everywhere.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because what you&rsquo;re going to do is pull fat</p>
<p>from the entire system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to break it down</p>
<p>through a process called lipolysis.</p>
<p>Which just means you break it down from the stored form.</p>
<p>You put it in the blood as that glycerol backbone,</p>
<p>which is that three carbon backbone</p>
<p>in the individual fatty acids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to float through the blood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a seven step system here,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll skip it for now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to have to get then uptaken into the muscle.</p>
<p>In the muscle then it has to get taken up</p>
<p>and run into the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Now that backbone, that three carbon glycerol backbone</p>
<p>is actually going to function almost exactly</p>
<p>like the three carbon pyruvate.</p>
<p>Just get it into the mitochondria,</p>
<p>cleave off one carbon, run it as that&rsquo;s took away.</p>
<p>Bada bing, bada boom.</p>
<p>Exact same thing.</p>
<p>Super easy to metabolize.</p>
<p>Small enough to go through the mitochondria membrane.</p>
<p>The fatty acid chains become a problem.</p>
<p>So if you have a chain that&rsquo;s longer</p>
<p>than our eight or so carbons,</p>
<p>it has to actually go through a special transporter</p>
<p>on the cell wall to get in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be limited by a thing called carnitine.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re probably familiar with that as a supplement.</p>
<p>You may have talked about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of places that make it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be a limiting factor.</p>
<p>If it is a smaller, what we call a short chain</p>
<p>or even a medium chain,</p>
<p>triglyceride which a lot of folks have heard of MCT.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>That can actually go directly through</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s small enough to pass through</p>
<p>and you can use it immediately as an energy source.</p>
<p>In either case, the way that you finally metabolize</p>
<p>a fatty acid is a process where you would go through</p>
<p>and cut off two carbons at a time.</p>
<p>Why would you cut off two?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re trying to make that two carbon acetyl-CoA</p>
<p>so you can run through that Krebs cycle again.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re cutting off two carbons at a time,</p>
<p>we have a special name for that oxidation process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called beta-oxidation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly why we call it beta-oxidation.</p>
<p>Two carbons in, you cut it off to make that acetyl-CoA.</p>
<p>So you can notice the oxidation pathway,</p>
<p>the electron transport pathway is identical</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re talking about the carbohydrates or the fat.</p>
<p>In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p>More to our point, if we&rsquo;re talking about simply fat loss,</p>
<p>it really just is about running</p>
<p>that electron transport chain.</p>
<p>Whether it came from a carbohydrate original source</p>
<p>or a fat original source,</p>
<p>it ends up in the mitochondria</p>
<p>as basically the exact same thing.</p>
<p>It then ends, the end of metabolism as the same thing.</p>
<p>Remember the final endpoint of carbohydrate metabolism</p>
<p>is water, ATP and CO2.</p>
<p>Do you want to guess the final endpoint of fat metabolism?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s water, ATP and CO2.</p>
<p>So practical applications here.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize fat loss,</p>
<p>what type of training is best?</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If you enjoy longer steady state stuff, fantastic.</p>
<p>If you enjoy intervals, amazing.</p>
<p>If you would like to do a combination,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my personal preference, that&rsquo;s great too.</p>
<p>You have a ton of options.</p>
<p>Pick what you think is a combination of challenging.</p>
<p>Not all exercise should be easy,</p>
<p>but you will actually enjoy somewhat</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re willing to accept.</p>
<p>And anything that you absolutely hate, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s very, very, very difficult</p>
<p>to do high intensity training.</p>
<p>You have to really be interested in doing it.</p>
<p>If not, it ends up turning into like</p>
<p>moderate intensity training.</p>
<p>You sort of just check the box</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t work that well</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just checking the box.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like, man, mentally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have it in me today</p>
<p>to get to a high heart rate and throw up</p>
<p>and all that stuff, cool.</p>
<p>But you can just do some moderate steady state stuff,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a win.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>more than 10 straight minutes and I&rsquo;m so bored.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re all, maybe you&rsquo;re also like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have 45 minutes,</p>
<p>I gotta get this done in eight minutes.</p>
<p>Great, go do some high intensity intervals.</p>
<p>Either option will be equally effective.</p>
<p>As you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>exercise is useful for aesthetic changes,</p>
<p>functionality and for longevity.</p>
<p>But when thinking about exercise specifically for fat loss,</p>
<p>I do have to ask this question.</p>
<p>I often hear from people</p>
<p>that they prefer one type of exercise versus another</p>
<p>for sake of fat loss</p>
<p>because certain forms of exercise make them very hungry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering whether or not there&rsquo;s any relationship</p>
<p>between the intensity or type of exercise</p>
<p>and the hunger stimulus.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have this problem</p>
<p>because basically everything makes me hungry.</p>
<p>And yet I&rsquo;m also okay fasting for part of the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those pseudo intermittent fasters.</p>
<p>Talk about what I mean by that.</p>
<p>I just happen to eat between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. naturally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not religious about it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t do it for any other reason</p>
<p>except that that tends to be when I&rsquo;m hungry</p>
<p>and I exercise outside of that in the morning typically.</p>
<p>In any case, is there a way that people can determine</p>
<p>what type of exercise might be better or worse for them</p>
<p>based on its appetite stimulating or inhibiting effects?</p>
<p>Because I also hear that some people will go for a long run</p>
<p>and then they are quote unquote not hungry</p>
<p>for several hours afterwards.</p>
<p>Does that have anything to do</p>
<p>with which fuels are being utilized</p>
<p>during different forms of exercise?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a really good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the mechanisms that could explain that answer.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is you hear the same comment</p>
<p>for physical activity.</p>
<p>In other words, people say,</p>
<p>man, if I do this type of training then I just am exhausted</p>
<p>and I lay around the rest of the day.</p>
<p>So my total caloric expenditure</p>
<p>is actually compromised as an aggregate because I&rsquo;m down.</p>
<p>The data would suggest in general that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So most of the time we don&rsquo;t see a reduction</p>
<p>in physical activity with either high intensity</p>
<p>or steady state training.</p>
<p>In fact, you generally see equal if not increased,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called NEAT.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the non-exercising part of your day</p>
<p>in addition to the basal metabolic rate.</p>
<p>So physical activity wise you don&rsquo;t seem to be propped.</p>
<p>Now hunger is a little bit of a different thing.</p>
<p>The answer here is I don&rsquo;t think we have time</p>
<p>to actually do justice on this.</p>
<p>So perhaps best to not get into this one.</p>
<p>Yeah, why don&rsquo;t we punt this down the road</p>
<p>to our discussion about nutrition specifically</p>
<p>and weave back to it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll earmark it for that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it sounds like if one is thinking purely</p>
<p>in terms of burning calories</p>
<p>and getting the health benefits of exercise</p>
<p>to create a caloric deficit, to create fat loss,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not they burn those calories</p>
<p>using a form of exercise that relies predominantly</p>
<p>on carbohydrate, fat or protein, correct?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that either one will work.</p>
<p>Because when we say things like that,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re actually identical.</p>
<p>There are some slight differences</p>
<p>and maybe those differences are important for some people</p>
<p>and not others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s either one is a viable strategy.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>What about protein as a fuel?</p>
<p>As an actual fuel.</p>
<p>So let me give you an analogy.</p>
<p>Imagine that you were with me a few weeks ago</p>
<p>in Southern Montana and we were out</p>
<p>in the wilderness for a week, okay?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cold out there and you needed to make a fire.</p>
<p>And if I said, look, you can pick any of these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some wood over there, we brought some newspaper</p>
<p>and then we brought a match and we need to create a fire.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna use that fire to energy and heat up.</p>
<p>Okay, I said, great.</p>
<p>The very first place you would probably start</p>
<p>to make that fire is the match.</p>
<p>You light the match and any match,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s gonna light immediately</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably gonna last five to 20 seconds,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, before it burns out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fossil creatine.</p>
<p>Real fast, real burns out.</p>
<p>If you were smart, you would take that match</p>
<p>and then light the newspaper on fire, right?</p>
<p>Now, if you were to burn a whole newspaper,</p>
<p>it is more energy than you get to the match,</p>
<p>but you still, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it gonna take, a few minutes?</p>
<p>Some number of minutes before an entire newspaper</p>
<p>burns up?</p>
<p>Yeah, five, I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>Depends on which type of newspaper it is, I guess, right?</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s carbohydrate, right?</p>
<p>If you were really smart, you would use that</p>
<p>to then light a piece of wood on fire.</p>
<p>And a wood, if you&rsquo;ve been in the wilderness,</p>
<p>it could last hours, days, it&rsquo;s really quite unlimited.</p>
<p>Your fossil creatine storage is very limited, small.</p>
<p>Glycogen is a lot higher,</p>
<p>because you can store it in muscle,</p>
<p>you can store it in other places,</p>
<p>so you have more, but not a lot.</p>
<p>Fat is unlimited.</p>
<p>The average person, if you&rsquo;re around, say, 70 kilos,</p>
<p>up 170 pounds or so, and you&rsquo;re moderately lean,</p>
<p>maybe 15% body fat, nothing crazy.</p>
<p>You probably have enough stored fat</p>
<p>to create enough energy to survive</p>
<p>for more than 30 days, right?</p>
<p>This would literally be, if you ingested zero calories,</p>
<p>you have enough fuel in your stored fat</p>
<p>to keep you alive for certainly 30 days.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t feel good and all those things.</p>
<p>But energetically, basically, fat will never,</p>
<p>ever be your limiting factor to performance.</p>
<p>So when we start talking about,</p>
<p>well, what limits my performance in these areas,</p>
<p>you can just wipe fat off the list.</p>
<p>It will never be your limiting factor</p>
<p>to any type of endurance performance.</p>
<p>You simply have way too much.</p>
<p>The only problem with fat is it&rsquo;s just too slow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta mobilize it, I&rsquo;ve gotta get it in the blood,</p>
<p>move it, that whole thing.</p>
<p>Too slow.</p>
<p>So if I wanna go faster,</p>
<p>I will never be able to fully utilize fat,</p>
<p>which is why we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never see a situation in which somebody</p>
<p>is 100% burning fat as a fuel and no percent carbohydrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always going to be too slow.</p>
<p>Highest you&rsquo;ll get, maybe 70 so percent.</p>
<p>Protein in this equation is none of that.</p>
<p>Now you may notice, how do you make paper?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s fibrous, you combine it with water,</p>
<p>it gets pressed, it gets compressed, yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s made from wood.</p>
<p>How do you make a match?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made from wood.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s carbohydrate?</p>
<p>A chain of carbon.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s fat?</p>
<p>A chain of carbon.</p>
<p>These are similar molecules, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re meant to give you pros and cons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to just light a log on fire</p>
<p>without a lot of work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.</p>
<p>So these are complimentary systems</p>
<p>that are really close to the same thing.</p>
<p>Protein is none of those things.</p>
<p>Protein is more like a piece of metal.</p>
<p>So if you were out in the woods with me</p>
<p>and we were trying to make a fire and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>hey look, I found some old railroad over there,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s throw that on there.</p>
<p>I would probably look at you like crazy.</p>
<p>Now technically, can you melt metal?</p>
<p>Sure, but you&rsquo;re gonna burn a lot of energy</p>
<p>to try to get a little bit back out of the metal</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;ve also cost yourself</p>
<p>a very, very valuable structure.</p>
<p>So protein is a fuel source for exercise or metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an incredibly poor choice.</p>
<p>Your body will do it.</p>
<p>Again, maybe five to 10%,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re burning a very valuable supply</p>
<p>in a situation in which you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s ever gonna be any more.</p>
<p>Remember, protein is fairly transient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very good at storing it.</p>
<p>You can store a ton of carbohydrate</p>
<p>in an unlimited, literally, amount of fat.</p>
<p>So you just really need to disregard</p>
<p>thinking about protein as a fuel source.</p>
<p>Your body does not wanna do it.</p>
<p>You are not good at it.</p>
<p>You can go through a process of gluconeogenesis from protein,</p>
<p>make glucose from it, it&rsquo;s just very poor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get much out of the exchange</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve burned your supply of metal,</p>
<p>which is gonna be very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very high commodity in the woods</p>
<p>or the wilderness to have something like metal.</p>
<p>For people that consume very low carbohydrate</p>
<p>or zero carbohydrate diets,</p>
<p>are they pulling more energy from muscle?</p>
<p>Which I imagine is a conversion of amino acids</p>
<p>into ready carbon chains.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, in this particular case,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve reached a certain level of adaptation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just gotten extremely good at generating glucose</p>
<p>from other fashions, right?</p>
<p>So you can bias heavily towards fat adaptation.</p>
<p>The downside is, and we&rsquo;ve seen this born in the literature,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to perform slower.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t care about maximizing performance,</p>
<p>especially over something where it is a maximal effort</p>
<p>for a few minutes or something,</p>
<p>then maybe you&rsquo;re not concerned.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely great,</p>
<p>especially for people just don&rsquo;t exercise.</p>
<p>Then hey, geez, very little concern here.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re interested in your performance</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wondering why you&rsquo;re just like slugging it down,</p>
<p>well, what you&rsquo;ve done is you&rsquo;ve down-regulated the ability,</p>
<p>literally the enzymes responsible</p>
<p>for that entire anaerobic glycolysis portion,</p>
<p>they get down-regulated,</p>
<p>which means there&rsquo;s not as much around anymore.</p>
<p>And so you get really bad and slow</p>
<p>at using carbohydrates as a fuel source.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very poor strategy</p>
<p>for people in an anaerobic-based sport</p>
<p>or who like that type of activity.</p>
<p>Again, if you don&rsquo;t care, no problem.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t exercise at all,</p>
<p>then you really have no problem there,</p>
<p>which is actually why a high-fat,</p>
<p>low-carbohydrate nutrition strategy</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t do much physical activity</p>
<p>is probably like, well, it&rsquo;s very effective.</p>
<p>It is a really good strategy for weight management,</p>
<p>for energy stabilization throughout the day,</p>
<p>and the research would very much support that.</p>
<p>In my observation, I would agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried low-carbohydrate diets</p>
<p>of severely limiting or completely limiting carbohydrate.</p>
<p>And after about two or three days, I feel pretty lousy,</p>
<p>but mostly because I want to train very intensely in the gym.</p>
<p>In addition to doing longer runs,</p>
<p>I tend to do all of those things across the week.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also observed and in fact know several people</p>
<p>that love the very low-carbohydrate,</p>
<p>aka ketogenic-type diet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doing ketogenic diets</p>
<p>for mental health reasons per se,</p>
<p>but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise</p>
<p>or they tend to do a lot of long endurance,</p>
<p>but low-intensity long endurance.</p>
<p>These are the I-walk-to-get-my-exercise types,</p>
<p>and they do indeed walk a lot.</p>
<p>And some of them manage to control their weight very readily</p>
<p>and like that diet for that reason.</p>
<p>When we had Lane Norton on the podcast,</p>
<p>he pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight,</p>
<p>you have to restrict something,</p>
<p>either time or macronutrients, et cetera,</p>
<p>to arrive at that subcaloric threshold,</p>
<p>get below the sub-maintenance threshold.</p>
<p>I guess one of the things I want to point out</p>
<p>is this should be received as, again,</p>
<p>not a this is better or worse.</p>
<p>This is just, you now have a ton of options.</p>
<p>So whatever personal preference, other factors,</p>
<p>you get to craft this strategy of performance,</p>
<p>aesthetics, and health based on your personal preferences.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;d like to go back to our classic list</p>
<p>of nine adaptations that exercise can induce.</p>
<p>The first four, of course, being largely,</p>
<p>largely unrelated to today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>but that were covered in the episode</p>
<p>that we did on strength, speed, and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So just to remind people,</p>
<p>the nine adaptations are number one, skill and technique,</p>
<p>two, speed, three, power, which is speed times force,</p>
<p>four, strength, and five, hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking about the remaining adaptations</p>
<p>on that list, starting with muscular endurance,</p>
<p>followed by anaerobic capacity,</p>
<p>followed by maximal aerobic output,</p>
<p>and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise.</p>
<p>So if we could start with muscular endurance,</p>
<p>this would be number six on the list of nine adaptations.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance, how do I build muscular endurance?</p>
<p>Why should I build muscular endurance?</p>
<p>And just to remind me what fuel sources are predominating</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m training for muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Great, so remember muscular endurance</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s going to be generally in a local muscle.</p>
<p>It is not a cardiovascular or systemic issue,</p>
<p>and it tends to be something in the neighborhood</p>
<p>of say five to maybe even up to 50 repetitions.</p>
<p>So this is the classic example we&rsquo;ll give here</p>
<p>is how many pushups can you do in a row?</p>
<p>Most people are gonna land somewhere in that range,</p>
<p>I just said.</p>
<p>How many sit-ups can you do in a minute?</p>
<p>How many pull-ups?</p>
<p>How long can you hang on a bar as a dead hang?</p>
<p>Things like that, that&rsquo;s muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Muscular endurance is not a mile run</p>
<p>or a marathon or anything like that.</p>
<p>So how long can I stand without breaking posture?</p>
<p>This is muscular endurance.</p>
<p>A plank, a wall sit.</p>
<p>Great, yes.</p>
<p>Love all these things, okay?</p>
<p>Now, the reason I took you on that big long metabolism</p>
<p>journey is so I could help you understand exactly</p>
<p>how to train this factor or any of these factors</p>
<p>with a more comprehensive understanding of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Meaning, thinking back to the metabolism,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna ask my triceps to do 50 pushups in a row,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to be my limiting factor?</p>
<p>Am I gonna run out of fat?</p>
<p>No chance.</p>
<p>Am I going to run out of glycogen?</p>
<p>No chance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way too few of repetitions.</p>
<p>You have a lot left there.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s gonna be the thing that stops me</p>
<p>from getting 51 repetitions?</p>
<p>Either you&rsquo;re gonna have too high of a pH rise,</p>
<p>so too much acid buildup,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna have a problem clearing the waste.</p>
<p>So really, this is two factors.</p>
<p>Dealing with acid buildup and getting acid out</p>
<p>of the muscle tissue and into circulation</p>
<p>because you have plenty of ability to handle</p>
<p>that small amount of acid buildup in your entire body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you can&rsquo;t handle it in that tiny spot.</p>
<p>Now, I picked the tricep for a very specific reason.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna deal with more pain</p>
<p>when you use a large muscle group</p>
<p>like your quads or your glutes</p>
<p>than you are with a small muscle group.</p>
<p>For example, nobody ever threw up after arm day,</p>
<p>but a lot of people throw up after leg day.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Look at the total amount of waste</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re dumping into your system</p>
<p>when you have quadrupled or 10x the muscle size.</p>
<p>Small muscle groups are only really going to be challenged</p>
<p>in that local area.</p>
<p>Large ones will dump so much waste into the system</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll wanna avoid that as quickly as possible,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why you throw up</p>
<p>after hard exercise.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So, the reason-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laughing because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever thrown up</p>
<p>from a weight training session,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s making me wonder if I&rsquo;ve ever trained that hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received or obtained the progress</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve wanted to generally over time,</p>
<p>not every week, every workout, every month,</p>
<p>but certainly over the 30 plus years</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been weight training,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve achieved the results I&rsquo;ve wanted.</p>
<p>I have, however, vomited after a long run</p>
<p>when I didn&rsquo;t hydrate well.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>Or if I drank too much water.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, too much water.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ll get that out quick.</p>
<p>Right, I just wanna be clear</p>
<p>because I think some people are getting the picture</p>
<p>that if they&rsquo;re not vomiting after their leg workout,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not training according to your standards.</p>
<p>Again, by the way, Dr. Andy Galpin runs experiments</p>
<p>in his lab, he&rsquo;s recruiting subjects all the time.</p>
<p>Also known as my graduate students.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>In any event, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but I felt it was a necessary interruption.</p>
<p>So muscular endurance, there&rsquo;s plenty of fuel.</p>
<p>Plenty of fuel, you manage acid buildup,</p>
<p>and you also need to get that fuel out of you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be a capillarization issue.</p>
<p>So the way that we can think about this</p>
<p>is capillaries surround your muscle,</p>
<p>and the whole point of them</p>
<p>is so that blood can come into them,</p>
<p>they hit this capillarization,</p>
<p>that actually slows the diffusion rate of blood down,</p>
<p>and so you can exchange nutrients in</p>
<p>and get waste products out,</p>
<p>and then we get things back into circulation.</p>
<p>So the more of those you have,</p>
<p>the better you are at dispersing</p>
<p>any of these waste products buildup,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s CO2 or the acid.</p>
<p>So the adaptation you&rsquo;re looking for here</p>
<p>is an increase in capillarization,</p>
<p>potentially a slight increase in mitochondria,</p>
<p>but the time is too fast, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna be able to need to do these 50 repetitions</p>
<p>in say under a minute or something like that.</p>
<p>So getting the mobilization into the mitochondria,</p>
<p>getting fuel that way, too slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really gonna get our performance here.</p>
<p>So what are strategies to increase acid buffering ability</p>
<p>and then capillarization?</p>
<p>So on the capillarization side,</p>
<p>you simply need to train at that ability.</p>
<p>So you go close to failure and practice that often.</p>
<p>That alone will increase blood flow to that local area,</p>
<p>which will take you through your process</p>
<p>of increasing capillarization.</p>
<p>Easy peasy, specificity.</p>
<p>Just to briefly interrupt, I find it remarkable,</p>
<p>although not surprising,</p>
<p>given how amazing the human body is,</p>
<p>that simply by doing some movement repeat,</p>
<p>like a wall sit or pushups or dips for that matter,</p>
<p>repeatedly over and over and over</p>
<p>until you reach that failure point</p>
<p>or that quaking point in the case of a wall sit,</p>
<p>that provides a stimulus for more capillaries</p>
<p>to be built into the system.</p>
<p>Literally the production or the trafficking</p>
<p>of endothelial cells, which make up the capillaries</p>
<p>and allow basically more little pipes</p>
<p>to feed the system with oxygen and remove waste products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like irrigation, right?</p>
<p>Imagine you had a giant field</p>
<p>and you had two big pipes running down the outside.</p>
<p>Well, in fact, if you wanna make sure water</p>
<p>gets evenly dispersed across the entire field,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a bunch of offshooting little pipes.</p>
<p>And the more of those you have, the more coverage you get.</p>
<p>Do we know what the specific signal is that says,</p>
<p>hey, I failed at this, we need more capillaries.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>I would speculate it&rsquo;s a combination of acidity</p>
<p>as well as carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and probably some nitric oxide stuff happening there,</p>
<p>but I actually don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing nobody knows for sure</p>
<p>because we still don&rsquo;t know, for instance,</p>
<p>what the exact signal is for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an amazing situation.</p>
<p>We know the requirements for getting the result we want,</p>
<p>but we still don&rsquo;t know what the specific signal is.</p>
<p>In any event, what I&rsquo;m hearing is building more capillaries</p>
<p>is great for enhancing muscular endurance.</p>
<p>And the way to get more capillaries into those muscles</p>
<p>is to train for muscular endurance</p>
<p>by getting close to failure or to some point</p>
<p>where you simply can&rsquo;t continue for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Could you give us an example</p>
<p>of what a reasonable training protocol might be</p>
<p>in terms of the classic Galpin list now,</p>
<p>exercise choice, maybe a few options,</p>
<p>order, volume, and frequency.</p>
<p>What should we be doing?</p>
<p>How often should we be doing it?</p>
<p>And for instance, should I do wall sits to failure,</p>
<p>then pushups to failure?</p>
<p>Given that this is a local process,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that if I do pushups to failure,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna increase the number of capillaries</p>
<p>in my legs very much.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So you nailed it.</p>
<p>Exercise choice is high precision here.</p>
<p>So pick the muscle group and the exact sequencing</p>
<p>and movement pattern you want.</p>
<p>High precision, this is the thing.</p>
<p>If you wanna get better at a plank, hold a plank.</p>
<p>You wanna do more pushups, do more pushups.</p>
<p>You can do some other stuff that&rsquo;s complimentary,</p>
<p>but really this is a high precision game.</p>
<p>Do the exact same thing for exercise choice.</p>
<p>Very simple there.</p>
<p>Okay, in terms of exercise order,</p>
<p>I suppose this dovetails with volume.</p>
<p>Can I combine training, let&rsquo;s say wall sits for my quads</p>
<p>and nearby muscle groups and then do pushups to failure</p>
<p>and then also do some sort of pulling exercise to failure?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Again, pick the exercises you want,</p>
<p>the movement patterns you wanna do and do them.</p>
<p>The order almost doesn&rsquo;t matter with the one caveat.</p>
<p>With larger muscle groups,</p>
<p>particularly again, multiple leg activities,</p>
<p>that will induce a small amount of systemic fatigue.</p>
<p>I guess theoretically wanting to maximize</p>
<p>your pushup number and you did a whole bunch</p>
<p>of say split squats and you just did those</p>
<p>and you did lunges for a mile or something like that,</p>
<p>you might actually slightly compromise.</p>
<p>You might not, but you might slightly compromise</p>
<p>your ability to do as many pull-ups in a row</p>
<p>or hold a bent over row or something like that.</p>
<p>So if you really cared about that level,</p>
<p>then you maybe wanna do the one thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most important first.</p>
<p>In general, my recommendation though</p>
<p>is to do the bigger muscle group first.</p>
<p>How many sets and how often should one perform training</p>
<p>for muscular endurance and when?</p>
<p>Now, the lovely part here is we&rsquo;ve moved down the spectrum</p>
<p>past hypertrophy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a lot of load here.</p>
<p>In fact, the load only needs to be at</p>
<p>or slightly above what you wanna move.</p>
<p>So if you wanna get better at moving 50%</p>
<p>of your 100 max, you don&rsquo;t really need to train</p>
<p>much more than 50, maybe 55 or 60% of your 100 max</p>
<p>because if you go higher than that,</p>
<p>the repetition count&rsquo;s going to fall</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re no longer going to be training</p>
<p>muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So you just need to stay right around that number</p>
<p>that you wanna work on.</p>
<p>So again, if the target is doing more pull-ups</p>
<p>and assuming that you have the strength to do it,</p>
<p>you check that box, you simply need to practice</p>
<p>the repetition range that you wanna be in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>
<p>You can repeat that a number of times,</p>
<p>but because remember, the volume is fairly low.</p>
<p>The load is very, very low.</p>
<p>You can actually repeat these quite frequently.</p>
<p>So you won&rsquo;t get extremely sore from muscular endurance</p>
<p>relative to traditional hypertrophy training</p>
<p>because the load is very, very light.</p>
<p>So you can do these more frequently if you would like.</p>
<p>More frequently such as?</p>
<p>You could do it three or four times a week easy</p>
<p>if you would like.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to.</p>
<p>Three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do more sets on a given day</p>
<p>and do less days, that would be fine.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to do two days a week</p>
<p>and you say you wanted to do,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you could do 25 push-ups</p>
<p>and the goal is to get to 30 push-ups just as an example.</p>
<p>You might say, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna do sets of 17</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna do three sets of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do that three days a week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna build up quite a bit.</p>
<p>Or you could say, look, I&rsquo;m gonna do a set</p>
<p>basically to failure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna recover and do one or two sets</p>
<p>that say 80% and I&rsquo;ll do that twice a week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna push the pace pretty well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of gains from that.</p>
<p>And again, this is not about hypertrophy.</p>
<p>This is about muscular endurance.</p>
<p>So I do wanna emphasize,</p>
<p>and again, please correct me if I&rsquo;m talking out of line here.</p>
<p>Do you wanna emphasize that because we mentioned pull-ups,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t get 25 pull-ups and you&rsquo;re doing 10,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not training for muscular endurance per se.</p>
<p>Remember, there&rsquo;s a big crossover here.</p>
<p>So anytime we&rsquo;re talking past like 15 reps,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re technically in hypertrophy and muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a common mistake.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna get bulky.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna go lighter and do more reps.</p>
<p>And then people grow.</p>
<p>And then you landed still right in the middle</p>
<p>of hypertrophy range.</p>
<p>So like for people who are like, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>like every time I lift weights, I blow up, I go lighter,</p>
<p>I do more reps and I,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still right in the hypertrophy zone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d actually be much better off training</p>
<p>very, very heavy in the one to three rep range.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d get really strong and they wouldn&rsquo;t grow much.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So tell me if this is a reasonable protocol</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;m gonna call the typical person.</p>
<p>In my mind, the typical person is somebody</p>
<p>who hopefully is doing resistance training,</p>
<p>hitting that 10 sets per muscle group per week minimum</p>
<p>to maintain or build strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but is also doing some long duration training</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a little bit.</p>
<p>Maybe throwing in a high intensity workout here or there,</p>
<p>some sprints, maybe some plyometrics,</p>
<p>some skill-based training</p>
<p>and doing a bunch of different things</p>
<p>to be what I would call all around fit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not training for any specific event</p>
<p>or trying to maximize any one of the nine adaptations</p>
<p>to the exclusion of the others.</p>
<p>That person decide, okay, after they do their longer run,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna do a plank to max duration.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna do a wall sit to max duration</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna do pushups to max duration.</p>
<p>And then also do that same workout</p>
<p>before they do their high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>some other point during the week,</p>
<p>and then maybe even do it again on their so-called rest day.</p>
<p>Just a real quick five minutes.</p>
<p>And in doing so, build more capillaries</p>
<p>into the relevant muscle groups</p>
<p>and build their muscular endurance</p>
<p>without eating into their overall recovery too much.</p>
<p>Too much, yeah.</p>
<p>So again, the nice part about this</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t hammer you too much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get tremendously sore</p>
<p>if you keep the load light.</p>
<p>The only switch I&rsquo;d make there</p>
<p>is I would probably do them after your interval</p>
<p>rather than before.</p>
<p>So you can make sure you keep quality there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not compromised by a local muscular endurance</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually trying to get a more systemic fatigue</p>
<p>with something like a higher intensity interval training.</p>
<p>So that would work fantastic.</p>
<p>The only other variable we haven&rsquo;t hit on here</p>
<p>is progression.</p>
<p>And this is very simple.</p>
<p>Try to add a rep or two per week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really all you have to go after.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re up to 22 this week, try to hit 23 next week.</p>
<p>For wall sits and planks, that would mean add time.</p>
<p>Time, yep.</p>
<p>And if you run into a wall there,</p>
<p>just like the same concepts we talked about with strength,</p>
<p>back it down to more like in the 80 or 85% range</p>
<p>and accumulate a lot more practice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna help a lot with capitalization</p>
<p>as well as acid buffering.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna continue to give yourself signals</p>
<p>for upregulation of the processes needed for that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not always pushing you to the end failure,</p>
<p>just like we don&rsquo;t wanna always go to failure with strength.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t wanna always go to failure</p>
<p>with high intensity intervals either.</p>
<p>Same thing would be happening here.</p>
<p>What about anaerobic capacity?</p>
<p>How should people train for anaerobic capacity?</p>
<p>What exactly are they training for?</p>
<p>Meaning what is the structural or cellar adaptation</p>
<p>or adaptations that are occurring</p>
<p>that allow for increases in anaerobic capacity?</p>
<p>And why are increases in anaerobic capacity good for us</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re a quote unquote endurance athlete</p>
<p>or we are a recreational exerciser</p>
<p>who is not interested in building more muscle speed</p>
<p>or things that I typically associate</p>
<p>with anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>So this is really, really fun.</p>
<p>Remember anaerobic capacity is the total amount of work</p>
<p>you can do for something like seconds to a few minutes.</p>
<p>And this is extremely high levels of fatigue,</p>
<p>the highest you&rsquo;re really going to see.</p>
<p>And by fatigue here, I mean acid buildup byproducts,</p>
<p>not fatigue as in like mentally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do this anymore.</p>
<p>So if we just think about the energetics for a second,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do say, let&rsquo;s take a really easy example</p>
<p>of people have done that thing where you go to the track</p>
<p>and you sprint the straightaways and you walk the corners.</p>
<p>You remember that sort of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tabatas, 30 on 30 off, things like this.</p>
<p>Like this is what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in this kind of anaerobic capacity area.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>Is fat going to be your limiting?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;ve already made that clear, right?</p>
<p>What about carbohydrates?</p>
<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s a single bout or two or three bouts,</p>
<p>probably not.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re doing this for a long time,</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re gonna go 30 on 30 off for 20 rounds,</p>
<p>you may actually start reaching a point</p>
<p>of running out of muscle glycogen.</p>
<p>In any of those cases though,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be running into an acid problem.</p>
<p>If you were to continue to do this multiple repetitions</p>
<p>in addition to running low on muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also gonna start running</p>
<p>into oxygen transportation problems</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re building up a lot of byproducts.</p>
<p>You gotta continue.</p>
<p>You will actually cruise into aerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>This is exactly why the community</p>
<p>that I have worked a lot with, professional fighters,</p>
<p>very high level boxers, world champions, UFC fighters.</p>
<p>It is a five minute round</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to do five times.</p>
<p>This is for world championship fights.</p>
<p>You get one minute break in between.</p>
<p>So imagine going like 30 on 30 off for five minutes,</p>
<p>getting a one minute break and doing that five times.</p>
<p>Even though the individual bouts are 30 seconds long,</p>
<p>the entire thing lasts so long.</p>
<p>It is primarily aerobic.</p>
<p>You have to have both capacities.</p>
<p>You gotta get really high anaerobic.</p>
<p>You also have to have a lot of aerobic going on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to start running into limitations</p>
<p>because of heart rate, stroke volume,</p>
<p>and then even potentially ventilation.</p>
<p>The need for oxygen to be able to come in</p>
<p>and clear the carbon dioxide totally out of the system</p>
<p>becomes a problem</p>
<p>because not only are you having so much buildup</p>
<p>for such a long time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also using multiple muscle groups.</p>
<p>So now this is a very important distinction.</p>
<p>Muscle endurance tends to be localized.</p>
<p>Now, this is not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing these intervals,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on an assault bike, you&rsquo;re sprinting up a hill,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re grappling with somebody,</p>
<p>you have a lot of muscles being involved,</p>
<p>which means all of that waste</p>
<p>is being dumped into the central part.</p>
<p>You have to clear it.</p>
<p>And by clear it, I now mean not out of the muscle,</p>
<p>I mean out of the body.</p>
<p>So your ability to bring in and utilize oxygen</p>
<p>is going to be a major limitation</p>
<p>to your ability to handle this stuff.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>Well, specificity wins.</p>
<p>Practice the exact thing you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So if you want to get better at sprinting the straightaways</p>
<p>and walking the corners, do that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t always do it though.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to run into limitations.</p>
<p>So this is when backing off to a lower intensity</p>
<p>is going to give you a lot of benefits.</p>
<p>We know very clearly</p>
<p>if you want to improve cardiovascular fitness,</p>
<p>high intensity, moderate intensity,</p>
<p>and low intensity are effective.</p>
<p>And you actually probably want to do</p>
<p>a little bit of all of them.</p>
<p>This is why none of our fighters</p>
<p>would ever just do high intensity training.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be some moderate,</p>
<p>we tend to call this like cardiac output training.</p>
<p>You can think of this as like</p>
<p>anywhere between zone two to zone four.</p>
<p>If you like zones, I don&rsquo;t use them personally.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to intentionally interrupt you</p>
<p>because this issue of zones has come up a few times.</p>
<p>I want to make sure everybody&rsquo;s on the same page.</p>
<p>You also mentioned that you don&rsquo;t necessarily favor</p>
<p>the zone nomenclature, but for those not familiar,</p>
<p>zone one, two, three, four, all the way up to five</p>
<p>is a kind of back of the envelope type verbiage</p>
<p>for some people and is more precisely followed</p>
<p>by for other people.</p>
<p>Meaning for me, zone one is simply walking, easy walking.</p>
<p>Zone two would be for anybody,</p>
<p>the pace or intensity of exercise that one could perform</p>
<p>while still maintaining a conversation, but just barely.</p>
<p>Meaning if you were to push any harder,</p>
<p>then it would be difficult to hold that conversation.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;d be in zone three.</p>
<p>And then zone three, four, five, as I understand them</p>
<p>are a little bit vague, but maybe you could give us</p>
<p>a sense of the breathing patterns associated</p>
<p>with each of the zones so that people could map to those</p>
<p>when we discuss zone one through five.</p>
<p>And as I say all this, I certainly tip my hat</p>
<p>to all of those people out there who like to measure</p>
<p>percent of maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>They like to use heart rate monitors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using any number of different devices.</p>
<p>I sometimes use those devices, but in general,</p>
<p>I tend not to, and I use my breathing as a rough guide</p>
<p>of which zone I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>So before we go back to specific protocols</p>
<p>for anaerobic capacity, tell me how you think about</p>
<p>zone one through five and how people might be able</p>
<p>to assess whether or not they are in zone one,</p>
<p>two, three, or four or five.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So zone five is that absolute top thing</p>
<p>and we can flag ourselves there.</p>
<p>I liked how you flagged one and two.</p>
<p>The distinction between three, four, and five,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less concerned with either.</p>
<p>We will do some heart rate stuff,</p>
<p>but not to identify what zone we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>The fact is the distinction between those zones</p>
<p>is basically just made up, right?</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s fake, but there&rsquo;s no like rationale there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like perceived effort in weightlifting.</p>
<p>Are you at a hundred percent output or 70%?</p>
<p>You know when you&rsquo;re at zero and you know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at a hundred in that moment,</p>
<p>but the difference between 60 and 70 is anybody&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>So we use, or the relevance, right?</p>
<p>So why does it matter if I&rsquo;m at 60 or 70?</p>
<p>Is there actually a difference?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, right?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter in that regard.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a very highly trained, particularly cyclist,</p>
<p>things like that, then,</p>
<p>and you can control a lot of circumstances,</p>
<p>those things start to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re in an open environment</p>
<p>like the athletes I deal with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not gonna matter that much.</p>
<p>So the way that I approach this is,</p>
<p>and I will use this word intentionally,</p>
<p>stolen directly from Brian McKenzie</p>
<p>and his company Shift Adapt.</p>
<p>They use what&rsquo;s called a gear system,</p>
<p>and I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been using for a long time.</p>
<p>So with Brian, with your permission,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take it right now.</p>
<p>Thank you, Brian.</p>
<p>He gave me the permission.</p>
<p>Thank you, Brian.</p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s a good friend of ours.</p>
<p>And I do think the breathing gear system is a terrific way</p>
<p>to think about the zones and to get a good sense</p>
<p>of what zone one happens to be in.</p>
<p>Yeah, great.</p>
<p>The first gear is your ability to simply breathe in</p>
<p>and out through your nose at a set cadence.</p>
<p>So basically, regardless of how hard you&rsquo;re working,</p>
<p>can you restrict your breathing</p>
<p>to like a two to three second inhale,</p>
<p>and then a two to three second exhale?</p>
<p>And this is really clever actually,</p>
<p>because a lot of folks will jump immediately</p>
<p>into an over-breathing strategy,</p>
<p>which means you&rsquo;ll be ventilating more than you need,</p>
<p>which actually sends that RER up higher than it needs to be,</p>
<p>which kicks you higher into carbohydrate utilization.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re supposed to be in quote-unquote zone one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to be efficient, not fast.</p>
<p>So using more carbohydrates than you need</p>
<p>is not beneficial here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re walking for the day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re out on a longer hike.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re enjoying the day.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to ramp up carbohydrate metabolism.</p>
<p>It should be efficient.</p>
<p>Ah, and so this would be getting into an argument</p>
<p>with somebody while on a long walk.</p>
<p>You feel exhausted afterwards.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been over-breathing.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally, right?</p>
<p>So you should be able to breathe at a specific cadence,</p>
<p>and generally people are doing that more frequently</p>
<p>than they need, right?</p>
<p>Zone two, rather gear two, is inhaling and exhaling</p>
<p>at whatever rate you need it to be, but still nasal only.</p>
<p>So it is a forced, right?</p>
<p>Whatever you need to do,</p>
<p>but your mouth is closed the entire time.</p>
<p>You shifted higher up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re burning more and more carbohydrate as a fuel source,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still able to control that</p>
<p>and restrict it through nasal breathing.</p>
<p>Now, gear three and four, which is our final ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no gear five.</p>
<p>Gear three and four is like a subtle distinction.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t even care about the difference there.</p>
<p>I basically use gear one, two, and then that&rsquo;s four,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically talking about</p>
<p>either a nose-to-mouth strategy</p>
<p>or a straight-up mouth-to-mouth, right?</p>
<p>So breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth.</p>
<p>If you can control it that way.</p>
<p>You can do the opposite, actually, right?</p>
<p>Can you breathe in and out through your nose?</p>
<p>But the classic one people will do</p>
<p>is in through the nose, out through the mouth.</p>
<p>Again, I really don&rsquo;t even care about distinction.</p>
<p>I basically jump from two to four.</p>
<p>Brian may do it differently.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know.</p>
<p>Four is just mouth-to-mouth, right?</p>
<p>And this is the case in most sporting applications.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be breathing</p>
<p>because the nose is restricted, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so much space.</p>
<p>And as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>the consequences of not having enough oxygen in</p>
<p>or CO2 exhalation, if you&rsquo;re restricting that,</p>
<p>this is gonna be problematic.</p>
<p>So in your actual competition,</p>
<p>please go to the mouth if you need to, right?</p>
<p>We practice a lot trying to stay nasal only</p>
<p>for as long as possible.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s going to eventually happen.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing your high intensity intervals</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really going as hard as you can,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to go to your mouth</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re an absolute freakazoid.</p>
<p>And you can stay in your nose,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not gonna happen, right?</p>
<p>Most people can&rsquo;t get past, say, 70 or 80%</p>
<p>while breathing through your nose.</p>
<p>I know some people can get higher,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the general distinction.</p>
<p>So we pay much more attention to those particular gears</p>
<p>than we do heart rate zones.</p>
<p>And zone five would be just pure mouth breathing all out,</p>
<p>running for your life.</p>
<p>The gear system is just one to four.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fifth gear.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So the gear four would again be mouth-to-mouth,</p>
<p>breathing as much in as you can,</p>
<p>breathing as much as you can out.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And I appreciate your description of the gear system</p>
<p>and how it roughly relates to the zones</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>I also am reminded,</p>
<p>if anyone wants to experience the relationship</p>
<p>between breathing and the offloading of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and your ability to exert effort in anything,</p>
<p>a game that a friend of mine sometimes likes to play</p>
<p>when we walk or jog and talk is he&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just hold our breath now until we hit that piling</p>
<p>or that lifeguard stand on the beach.</p>
<p>And within seconds, you actually can start to panic.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It becomes very hard to coordinate your action</p>
<p>after a little while.</p>
<p>Again, be really careful with this,</p>
<p>but it will teach you in a moment in a very real world way</p>
<p>how important it is to be able to offload carbon dioxide</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re probably not running out of oxygen</p>
<p>at those lower intensities.</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re simply building up carbon dioxide</p>
<p>and that gas reflex is screaming to go off</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re actively suppressing it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the interesting test here is your CO2 tolerance.</p>
<p>On Brian&rsquo;s website, you can go directly there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a video to how to run this test</p>
<p>and then you can put in your numbers</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll tell you sort of exactly what to do</p>
<p>as a result of it.</p>
<p>But the CO2 tolerance test</p>
<p>is a test of exactly what you just mentioned.</p>
<p>So you should be fairly tolerant.</p>
<p>In other words, non-reactive.</p>
<p>You can be responsive, but non-reactive</p>
<p>to elevations in CO2.</p>
<p>So you should see them and feel them,</p>
<p>but you should be choosing how you respond</p>
<p>rather than an inert reaction.</p>
<p>There are interesting data looking at things</p>
<p>like out of the blue panic attacks.</p>
<p>You can actually notice those in blood</p>
<p>via rises in CO2 up to 45 minutes</p>
<p>prior to the event happening.</p>
<p>So there are signals happening in your body</p>
<p>that you may be sensitive or not sensitive to.</p>
<p>The more in tune you can get with that,</p>
<p>the better your life is gonna be.</p>
<p>And even if we&rsquo;re specifically</p>
<p>just talking about exercise performance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s okay for CO2 to rise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to rise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a byproduct of carbohydrate and fat metabolism</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve established.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel that.</p>
<p>However, if you immediately go into a panic</p>
<p>because of a small increase in CO2, this is a problem.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re turning to anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>This morning we were training, not together.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with your workout,</p>
<p>but in the same general space.</p>
<p>And I did my once a week maximum heart rate</p>
<p>one minute sprint on the assault bike.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll do more minutes,</p>
<p>meaning I will do one minute,</p>
<p>then take some rest and do another minute after some rest.</p>
<p>But I decided to do that one minute with you there</p>
<p>so I could learn from you.</p>
<p>And indeed, I have to assume that</p>
<p>that was largely within the anaerobic capacity realm.</p>
<p>The first 30 seconds or so were manageable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting more and more painful.</p>
<p>There was a quit signal going off in my head.</p>
<p>You said there&rsquo;s real magic that occurs around second 40</p>
<p>and indeed somewhere around second 40,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, it seemed easier.</p>
<p>But at the one minute mark, I was happy to stop</p>
<p>because I was really at, at least what felt to me,</p>
<p>100% output.</p>
<p>Is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic capacity?</p>
<p>Keeping in mind what you said before,</p>
<p>which is that specificity or precision,</p>
<p>as you phrased it, is important.</p>
<p>That is, if I want to train anaerobic capacity for sprinting,</p>
<p>I probably should have been sprinting.</p>
<p>Cycling, I was on the assault bike and so on.</p>
<p>How many of those one minute all out sprints</p>
<p>or 30 second all out sprints on the bike</p>
<p>could and should one perform per workout and per week?</p>
<p>So marching through exercise choice.</p>
<p>Yep, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Order, volume, frequency, and progression.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Choice of exercises,</p>
<p>train for what you want to improve, is that right?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>So in this particular case,</p>
<p>if you have a specific goal, yes, of course, do it.</p>
<p>Exercise choice, a couple of things you want to look for.</p>
<p>You want to pick something that you feel</p>
<p>extremely confident in the movement with,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to forget your brain very quickly here</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to go into our pain cave.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not comfortable running, don&rsquo;t go run here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to get to the spot</p>
<p>when you need to get to it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable,</p>
<p>or if every time you go on a rower,</p>
<p>your low back hurts the next day, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable using kettlebell swing,</p>
<p>you get the point.</p>
<p>If you do an exercise you&rsquo;re not comfortable with,</p>
<p>you also secondarily want to be careful</p>
<p>or cautious of heavy eccentric loads,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to be doing a lot of repetitions</p>
<p>at a high intensity.</p>
<p>So this is where I love an assault bike.</p>
<p>This is why a rower is great.</p>
<p>Swimming is amazing.</p>
<p>Running uphill, generally more favorable</p>
<p>than running on normal ground,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not a runner.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t run downhill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of eccentric load.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love things like box jumps here, right?</p>
<p>Because again, a lot of eccentric loading,</p>
<p>suppose you can jump up, land on the box, step down,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re, again,</p>
<p>too many things are going through your mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to slip and fall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to smash my shin on the box.</p>
<p>What happens if I, too many variables.</p>
<p>Pick something that is safer</p>
<p>where you can really focus on your breathing</p>
<p>and your posture and the performance.</p>
<p>All right, so that&rsquo;s exercise choice.</p>
<p>And then within that,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some specific thing you want to get better at,</p>
<p>go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How many different movements?</p>
<p>Meaning, should I do the assault bike</p>
<p>and then some form of safe executable overhead pressing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little harder to imagine anaerobic capacity</p>
<p>for the upper body unless you have access to a skier</p>
<p>or one of these, what are those things called?</p>
<p>The climber machines?</p>
<p>Yeah, the VersaClimber.</p>
<p>The VersaClimber.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one, the VersaClimber.</p>
<p>You can tell how often I do that one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great piece of exercise equipment.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re thinking how many exercises</p>
<p>and in what order?</p>
<p>Is it going to be two or three exercises</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re involving a lot of muscle groups typically?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really distinction.</p>
<p>Generally, these are going to be total body movements.</p>
<p>So you can do something like a skier</p>
<p>if you want to really isolate your upper body.</p>
<p>Great, love that.</p>
<p>You can do lower body isolation like cycling,</p>
<p>right, where your upper body&rsquo;s not involved.</p>
<p>You can use weights here.</p>
<p>You can do some barbell movements and stuff like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not my favorite choices for most people.</p>
<p>Too many complexity things going on.</p>
<p>So I generally am going to pick total body movements,</p>
<p>pushing a sled, dragging a sled, sprinting uphill,</p>
<p>swamming, these things like that are going to be good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing now why the assault bike is such a powerful tool</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using your arms</p>
<p>with some degree of resistance</p>
<p>but not a lot of eccentric load, plus legs,</p>
<p>some resistance, not a lot of eccentric load,</p>
<p>and yet one can go quote unquote all out</p>
<p>for 30 to 60 seconds.</p>
<p>And the consequences of a technical breakdown are minimal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like you&rsquo;re going to actually</p>
<p>have a worse performance rather than an injury rate.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just a wonderful invention because of that</p>
<p>where other things, the consequences,</p>
<p>like say if you&rsquo;re going to be doing a barbell</p>
<p>or kettlebell activity,</p>
<p>the consequences of making a technical mistake,</p>
<p>you might actually get an acute injury right there.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just a little bit higher in the risk scale.</p>
<p>How many sets or sometimes referred to as repeats.</p>
<p>So how many 30 to 60 second all out sprints,</p>
<p>again, doesn&rsquo;t have to be running, sprinting,</p>
<p>but all out effort would be the better way to phrase it.</p>
<p>Should I perform, let&rsquo;s say per week,</p>
<p>and then decide whether or not we can divide those up</p>
<p>across multiple workouts or whether or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to do them in the same workout.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re staying with the same exercise</p>
<p>for all of your workouts,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit different answer</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;re modifying them.</p>
<p>So say you&rsquo;re going to do this three times a week</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to do an air bike one day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do some hill sprints another day,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to do some swimming another day.</p>
<p>For sake of example, I&rsquo;m going to say same movement</p>
<p>because I think most people are going to be most comfortable</p>
<p>with one or two types of movements</p>
<p>unless they are really coordinated or an excellent athlete.</p>
<p>I think most people can probably find a hill</p>
<p>that they could run up and an air diner assault bike,</p>
<p>a rower, things of that sort.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a pro and a con here.</p>
<p>So the pro of doing less sets</p>
<p>is you can actually train much closer to truly 100%.</p>
<p>The downside is volume&rsquo;s low.</p>
<p>So a major mistake people make here</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ll do something like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do that for 40 rounds.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really actually going that hard</p>
<p>in those 20 seconds.</p>
<p>So a key, in fact, if you look at the literature</p>
<p>and all the positive benefits</p>
<p>of high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>that assumes you are actually hitting very close to 100%.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sliding down into, again, moderate training stuff,</p>
<p>you start to actually be in a spot</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not getting the total high-end stuff,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not doing it long enough</p>
<p>to get the low-end stuff either.</p>
<p>And so you end up in this, you burned some calories.</p>
<p>You probably still enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis</p>
<p>and a little bit of capitalization,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t really justify only doing three rounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the problem comes in.</p>
<p>So in terms of a couple of protocols I&rsquo;ll give you,</p>
<p>how many sets per week?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to give a number</p>
<p>unlike the strength training stuff</p>
<p>where it was easy to kind of land some stuff on.</p>
<p>A typical thing you&rsquo;ll see is a minimum build</p>
<p>tends to be something like four rounds per day,</p>
<p>three times per week.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>So my once a week all-out effort</p>
<p>of sprinting on the assault bike,</p>
<p>the so-called Airdyne bike,</p>
<p>for 60 seconds, one to three rounds of that,</p>
<p>might be doing something useful for me,</p>
<p>but I should probably be doing that</p>
<p>two or three times a week.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna get to a max heart rate,</p>
<p>I generally like to say,</p>
<p>give me a minimum of one day a week, two&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Days per week, how many rounds?</p>
<p>Whatever it takes you to get to that maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>Right, so in your case, you did one minute.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna extend past a minute or two,</p>
<p>one round might be enough.</p>
<p>So for example, if you wanna just do something</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m gonna run a mile as fast as I can,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you need to do for the day.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do multiple,</p>
<p>you can do mile repeats if you&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>but that is really, really challenging.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;ve extended the time duration here,</p>
<p>but I wanted to go there to show you</p>
<p>the time domain matters here.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing something like a 20 second burst,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need more rounds.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing something longer</p>
<p>like multiple minutes,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need as many rounds to get there.</p>
<p>So in addition, if you&rsquo;re really reaching past</p>
<p>this 90 seconds of hell window,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna do a lot more damage to the system.</p>
<p>Not damaging than bad,</p>
<p>but as in there&rsquo;s a lot to recover here.</p>
<p>So we need more recovery time from that.</p>
<p>A 20 second burst doesn&rsquo;t really challenge you.</p>
<p>It challenges you in that 20 seconds,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll be recovered and fine.</p>
<p>The three minute thing is gonna hurt</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna hurt for many, many, many minutes after that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to still see</p>
<p>maybe some performance decrements the next day,</p>
<p>depending on what your recovery stuff looks like.</p>
<p>So a couple of things to play with</p>
<p>would be something like this.</p>
<p>If you wanna try like a classic 30 seconds on,</p>
<p>30 seconds off protocol,</p>
<p>the literature will show like a minimum of four rounds</p>
<p>of that probably three days a week.</p>
<p>So 30 seconds all out, 30 seconds rest is one round.</p>
<p>Repeat that four times, at least once a week.</p>
<p>At least, two would be better.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If you wanna go something a lot longer than that,</p>
<p>you might be able to get away with one.</p>
<p>But generally two days a week of this is better.</p>
<p>If you start actually pushing past</p>
<p>like three to four days a week, up to five or six,</p>
<p>you may actually be causing some problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a little bit of excess fatigue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna happen there</p>
<p>that you maybe wanna stay away from.</p>
<p>In fact, you can see a lot of endocrinological problems</p>
<p>and some other sleep issues and some other things kick in.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about more of those things later.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the number to get with.</p>
<p>If you wanna try something more like a 20 second burst,</p>
<p>I actually would recommend giving yourself more rest.</p>
<p>So you can actually do a higher rest than work ratio.</p>
<p>Most people tend to think of this as doing like one to one,</p>
<p>20 seconds on, 20 seconds off or lower.</p>
<p>I love doing like 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off.</p>
<p>The quality of that 20 seconds becomes extraordinarily high.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible to now get like six to eight rounds.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;m hearing this, I&rsquo;m going to wager an offer to you.</p>
<p>And if you say okay, then to those listening.</p>
<p>Based on what you&rsquo;re telling me about the relationship</p>
<p>between intensity and quality</p>
<p>and the need for sufficient duration of this anaerobic work,</p>
<p>how is five to six minutes per week of all out work?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>So what that means for me is I would do three</p>
<p>all out one minute sprints on one workout</p>
<p>separated by a minute or two, maybe more.</p>
<p>And I would do that two or three times per week,</p>
<p>just trying to hit that five or six minute</p>
<p>per week threshold.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Actually, I think one of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Marty Gabala is a scientist, a Canadian guy, amazing work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done a lot of the research</p>
<p>on high intensity interval stuff, right?</p>
<p>And I think the number he actually threw out there</p>
<p>in some of his original research</p>
<p>was comparing six total minutes of work</p>
<p>to upwards of like 180 minutes of work</p>
<p>throughout the entire week.</p>
<p>And then one of the classic studies</p>
<p>was looking at VO2 max improvements</p>
<p>and he saw equal if not greater improvements</p>
<p>of VO2 max with that.</p>
<p>So I think actually the name of his book</p>
<p>might be like the six minute workout or something.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;d like may have nailed that directly on the head.</p>
<p>Purely by luck, but actually by-</p>
<p>I also may be wrong on that number</p>
<p>so we should probably fact check that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and also by inference from what you were saying,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do this 20 seconds on 40 seconds off</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing more rounds or one minute all out.</p>
<p>So the way I&rsquo;m going to think about this,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s okay with you is for five to six minutes a week,</p>
<p>I am sprinting for my life.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sprinting for my life with good form</p>
<p>in whatever movement I happen to be doing.</p>
<p>And I can do all of that in one workout,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m separating out bouts of 20 seconds</p>
<p>all the way up to one minute by the necessary rest</p>
<p>in order to recover my breathing,</p>
<p>get back to pure nasal breathing,</p>
<p>maybe zone one, zone two.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And then hit it again.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna do the one minute thing like you do,</p>
<p>I actually generally encourage one to three minutes of rest</p>
<p>before you do the next round</p>
<p>and probably up to four to six rounds.</p>
<p>That would be your six minute number there.</p>
<p>Now, the caveat there is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t worry about heart rate recovery.</p>
<p>We worry about exactly what you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is nasal only recovery.</p>
<p>Once you can get back to that,</p>
<p>give yourself another 30 seconds or so</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re ready to go for round two.</p>
<p>This is where it gets fun</p>
<p>because I can imagine challenging myself</p>
<p>to get on the assault bike for one minute</p>
<p>of kind of warmup, very low intensity each morning,</p>
<p>and then sprint for a minute</p>
<p>and then head off into my daily routine.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That, if you&rsquo;re going to do that though,</p>
<p>you need to give me three minutes of nasal only breathing</p>
<p>before you go back to work.</p>
<p>We need to down regulate after that.</p>
<p>I can certainly do that.</p>
<p>And there are people in my life</p>
<p>that would love for me to engage in more nasal breathing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll have me speaking less.</p>
<p>So, no problem.</p>
<p>Chances are I&rsquo;m going to use</p>
<p>the two or three workouts per week of one minute all out.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll try the shorter protocol.</p>
<p>Can I give you one fun protocol to try here?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>So, if you have a, you can use this on any equipment,</p>
<p>but I learned this from another mutual friend, Kenny Kane.</p>
<p>This is a great little, it&rsquo;s a little test,</p>
<p>a little game you can play with yourself.</p>
<p>And the only way to play this game is you&rsquo;re going to lose,</p>
<p>which is really, really lovely.</p>
<p>So, you can do this for any duration of time,</p>
<p>but two minutes is a good number.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, you have to do this in somewhere</p>
<p>where you can know distance.</p>
<p>So, this could be running, cycling.</p>
<p>The air bike is what I use.</p>
<p>The first two minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to cover as much distance</p>
<p>as you can possibly cover in two minutes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to note that.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s say you covered 400 meters, right?</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to rest for two minutes.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>That next round, you&rsquo;re now going to go for distance.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re going to cover the exact same amount of distance</p>
<p>you covered in round one,</p>
<p>which in this example was 400 meters.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter how long it takes you.</p>
<p>It may take you two minutes and five seconds,</p>
<p>two minutes and 10 seconds,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a little bit fatigued from round one.</p>
<p>Round three, you&rsquo;re going to now come back</p>
<p>and do that exact same time domain</p>
<p>that you did in round two.</p>
<p>So, if it took you two minutes and five seconds</p>
<p>in round two,</p>
<p>now round three is going to last two minutes</p>
<p>and five seconds.</p>
<p>And you want to see if you can cover a greater distance,</p>
<p>405 meters, 410 meters,</p>
<p>than you did in round one.</p>
<p>And the beauty of this little protocol,</p>
<p>six minutes total of work, right?</p>
<p>But if you slack in one of the rounds,</p>
<p>you just make the next round harder.</p>
<p>Is there any rest between rounds?</p>
<p>Yeah, two minutes.</p>
<p>Always two minutes rest.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, but this would be my recommendation.</p>
<p>Kenny Kane came up with this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he came up with it.</p>
<p>He taught me this thing.</p>
<p>We both know Kenny</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an incredibly nice and incredibly skilled trainer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to call it the sugar cane.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so great because it sounds really painful.</p>
<p>And if you go out too hard in round one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in such big trouble round two.</p>
<p>But if you go too easy in round one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get absolutely obliterated in round three.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s like a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>And you can pick that number as a standardization</p>
<p>and then just try to improve that a little bit per week.</p>
<p>So, progression is the last part of this whole thing</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t gotten to yet before we move on.</p>
<p>And the way you want to progress all of these things</p>
<p>is you can timestamp, again, how much work you can do</p>
<p>and then just try to do a slightly higher amount of work,</p>
<p>5% or so every week.</p>
<p>Or you can add a round, which is a really nice way.</p>
<p>So, in the research studies that have been done,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to do things like week one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll do three rounds.</p>
<p>Week two, you&rsquo;ll do four rounds.</p>
<p>Week three, you&rsquo;ll go five rounds.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll like add a round until you get up to say six</p>
<p>or seven or eight rounds at the end of the protocol.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a really nice way to go about it.</p>
<p>Or you can cap the rounds</p>
<p>and just try to get more work done</p>
<p>in that same amount of time.</p>
<p>Meaning go more intensely.</p>
<p>Correct, get further distance in your 30 seconds</p>
<p>or your 45 seconds or whatever.</p>
<p>I want to encourage people to go as low as 20 seconds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to allow you to go very, very, very fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to actually challenge</p>
<p>that phosphocreatine piece a little bit.</p>
<p>I want to encourage people to also go as high as 90 seconds.</p>
<p>So, the honest way, the way that I will do it,</p>
<p>not that it&rsquo;s about me,</p>
<p>but just as an example of something you could do,</p>
<p>I do something in the 15 to 20 second burst range.</p>
<p>And I will generally hedge towards a two to one</p>
<p>rest to work ratio.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m probably going to rest 40 to 60 seconds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to make sure that 20 second burst</p>
<p>is extremely high quality.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to do something in the 30 to 50 second range.</p>
<p>I might go one to one work rest ratio.</p>
<p>The quality of those 30 seconds is going to come down,</p>
<p>but the acid buffering</p>
<p>is going to be extraordinarily challenged.</p>
<p>I also will do that with a triple or quadruple rest range.</p>
<p>So again, 30 seconds on, maybe two minutes off.</p>
<p>Now, I won&rsquo;t be able to be,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be working on my ability to handle</p>
<p>the waste product build up there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll be working on my ability</p>
<p>to produce more force over that time,</p>
<p>which is another skill set.</p>
<p>And then all the way up to say what you do,</p>
<p>a minute, 70 seconds, and you can go one to one there,</p>
<p>or up to three to one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be working on</p>
<p>a little bit of this different thing,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly how we hit both sides of this equation.</p>
<p>Working on dealing with waste,</p>
<p>as well as actually working on bringing in nutrients</p>
<p>and getting that system a little bit more effective.</p>
<p>So, you could set that up across your week.</p>
<p>And just, it could be something like,</p>
<p>day one is that 20 second burst window,</p>
<p>day two is that maybe 60 second window,</p>
<p>and then day three is maybe one all out effort,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re done there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the specific protocols</p>
<p>and adaptations related to maximum aerobic output,</p>
<p>or maximum aerobic capacity as it&rsquo;s sometimes called.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re moving past like that couple of minute range</p>
<p>into like the, you know, five to 15 minute range,</p>
<p>but at a maximum intensity.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the highest you can go from there?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about our last category</p>
<p>of long duration here.</p>
<p>Well, the beautiful part is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already explained a lot of it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very similar to what we just talked about</p>
<p>with anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>It is primarily going to be a problem</p>
<p>of dealing with waste products, especially at the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough total distance</p>
<p>to be running out of muscle glycogen,</p>
<p>though it may start to creep down a little bit.</p>
<p>Fat&rsquo;s not going to be an issue,</p>
<p>but certainly more oxygen transportation</p>
<p>is going to be an issue.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re just hedging a little bit more</p>
<p>towards that side of the equation.</p>
<p>Towards the end of that workout,</p>
<p>no doubt about it, clearing out waste products</p>
<p>is going to be a huge issue.</p>
<p>But really, oxygen demand delivery</p>
<p>is starting to take more of a prominent role,</p>
<p>because we have had more time to clear the waste.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re not good at that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be failing earlier than we need.</p>
<p>So, the training for that needs to be a little bit</p>
<p>at that exact same.</p>
<p>So, a classic thing here is a one mile test, right?</p>
<p>This is going to last for most people</p>
<p>somewhere between five and 10 minutes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sort of right in this window.</p>
<p>If you just want to practice that once a week,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done here, right?</p>
<p>Exercise choice, same thing we talked about, right?</p>
<p>Pick an exercise you&rsquo;re comfortable with</p>
<p>that you can actually do,</p>
<p>and you can progressively increase</p>
<p>in terms of the intensity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have to stop and change your exercise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have to move around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a circuit isn&rsquo;t great here,</p>
<p>because you got to put one implement down,</p>
<p>pick up another one.</p>
<p>You want to be doing something</p>
<p>where there is literally not a second of off switch.</p>
<p>So, similar exercise choice principles we just covered.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to become a real savage,</p>
<p>and you want to do repeats here, you can.</p>
<p>Endurance folks will do that a lot.</p>
<p>One mile repeats, 800 meter repeats, things like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the swimming distance equivalents would be,</p>
<p>but swimmers, we do this constantly, but you don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>This is really hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hard in the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good for you.</p>
<p>One to twice a week of hitting this,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be in a really, really good spot.</p>
<p>Frequency, we sort of just covered.</p>
<p>We covered exercise choice.</p>
<p>Volume, we just sort of nailed.</p>
<p>And intensity is basically running you up to the top there.</p>
<p>Now, because you can only do that so often,</p>
<p>you want to add in another 40 or so percent of your time</p>
<p>being lower intensity support work for that.</p>
<p>So, this is something probably less than 85%</p>
<p>of your heart rate,</p>
<p>but higher than quote unquote zone two.</p>
<p>You got to be working here.</p>
<p>This is not, I could have a conversation pace.</p>
<p>This is higher than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in between conversation pace</p>
<p>and the pace I need to be at</p>
<p>to run my fastest mile I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that middle ground.</p>
<p>And you need to train that</p>
<p>so that you can continue to work on capitalization,</p>
<p>oxygen transportation,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not burning down the house,</p>
<p>getting all the way up to 100 plus percent of your VO2 max.</p>
<p>Could I use a crude version of this</p>
<p>where I say, okay, I&rsquo;m going to exercise for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go as fast as I safely can.</p>
<p>And every week I&rsquo;m going to measure how far I travel.</p>
<p>Yep, easy.</p>
<p>In that 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Probably not on the same day</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m doing the anaerobic capacity work.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Probably okay to do after a strength training</p>
<p>or hypertrophy workout,</p>
<p>as long as I didn&rsquo;t train legs.</p>
<p>You could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably going to compromise recovery is the way.</p>
<p>So I would, if you&rsquo;re going to do a session like this,</p>
<p>I would probably do it on its own day.</p>
<p>Unless you wanted to do something like speed or power,</p>
<p>then you could roll right into this and have no problem.</p>
<p>Maybe a strength day, a hypertrophy day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you would do there because, again,</p>
<p>especially if you did any sort of lower body exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be compromised here.</p>
<p>But remember, these tend to be full body movements.</p>
<p>So even if you did arms that day,</p>
<p>your arms are going to be compromised.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to fail this</p>
<p>because of local muscular failure.</p>
<p>All right, so now I&rsquo;ve got my work cut out for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be doing five to six minutes per week</p>
<p>of all-out work divided into 20 to 60 second bouts</p>
<p>with sufficient rest.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to give myself 10 minutes a week of,</p>
<p>in my case, it&rsquo;ll probably be running as fast as I can</p>
<p>because I do enjoy running and I can do it safely.</p>
<p>Maybe uphill and see how far I go.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>If you want to combine the two.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re just saying, hey, I&rsquo;m bought in, Andy.</p>
<p>I want to do both of these things.</p>
<p>They are similar, but they have independent benefits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced.</p>
<p>How would I build these into the same week?</p>
<p>Maybe do one of each.</p>
<p>That still gets you at quote unquote, two days per week</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to hit a high maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>So we already checked that box off.</p>
<p>So one day can be a shorter length interval repeat one.</p>
<p>And the other one can simply be a five to 15 minute</p>
<p>maximum work and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Long duration endurance exercise,</p>
<p>the stereotypical endurance exercise.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>How far, how long, how fast or how slow rather should I go?</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m going to venture that exercise choice</p>
<p>is one that we could click off even at this point</p>
<p>in the discussion, because obviously it&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>something that I can do for a long while</p>
<p>without getting injured, overuse injuries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of novelty</p>
<p>we can actually throw in here.</p>
<p>So one of the things I love to do for long duration</p>
<p>and endurance for people who don&rsquo;t love running,</p>
<p>cycling or swimming is you can do the really cool workout,</p>
<p>any number of things where you can put a little circuit</p>
<p>together, as long as there&rsquo;s not a lot of downtime</p>
<p>between one circuit to the next time,</p>
<p>you can actually do something as simple as like,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re going to do farmer&rsquo;s carries</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll do that for say three minutes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll set those down and you&rsquo;ll go straight</p>
<p>into a plank for a minute.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll pick that up and you go straight</p>
<p>into maybe body weight squats for two minutes.</p>
<p>Then you go straight into another exercise</p>
<p>and you can sort of rotate things around.</p>
<p>Maybe you can do even some like shadow boxing stuff</p>
<p>or some jump rope.</p>
<p>You can do different gymnastics movements</p>
<p>and body weight movements.</p>
<p>And you can run that thing through</p>
<p>and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished</p>
<p>and not feel like you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, this mind numbing type of training</p>
<p>if it feels like that to you.</p>
<p>Another way you can do that to actually even simplify it</p>
<p>even more, we&rsquo;ve done this at Kenny Kane&rsquo;s gym</p>
<p>plenty of times where you just maybe even pick</p>
<p>three machines.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to go, I&rsquo;m going to go 10 minutes</p>
<p>on the rower and I&rsquo;m going to go 10 minutes</p>
<p>on the treadmill and I&rsquo;m going to go 10 minutes on the bike.</p>
<p>You can actually knock a 30 minute quote unquote</p>
<p>steady state session out in and not feel those problems</p>
<p>if those things happen.</p>
<p>So you can actually have a lot of fun there.</p>
<p>We will do a lot of times with our fighters,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do things like put a very low load.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking sub 50% of your max on a barbell</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to squat and you&rsquo;re going to do,</p>
<p>you know, maybe a minute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to put that down and then you&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>over and do 50% of a bench press.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to put that down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go over and do 50% of a crab walk.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to go over and do another one.</p>
<p>And you can actually run through this entire thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hit that many reps in any individual movement.</p>
<p>The load is very, very light and you can keep heart rate</p>
<p>basically a steady state and do 15 or 20</p>
<p>or 30 different exercises.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually like fairly fun and engaging to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit more specific than trying to get</p>
<p>a 275 pound NFL player to run for 30 minutes,</p>
<p>which is not going to be good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just chuckling because I love to run outdoors</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed runs on all my travels.</p>
<p>And I find it to be a great way to see different places.</p>
<p>I like moving through space,</p>
<p>but there are weather conditions</p>
<p>and times when that&rsquo;s not an option.</p>
<p>So what you described is a terrific alternative.</p>
<p>I have to assume that the specific adaptation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurring here is related to the fat burning system.</p>
<p>And again, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean fat loss overall,</p>
<p>but fat burning system.</p>
<p>And yet I do have a question, which is,</p>
<p>can you build enhanced micro capillary systems</p>
<p>into the muscles by doing this long duration cardio?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely you can.</p>
<p>In fact, depending on which paper you like more</p>
<p>than the other papers,</p>
<p>you may even find evidence that this is a superior method</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>So steady state endurance is very important.</p>
<p>I used to not like it as much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much evidence now that suggests</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a really good thing for basically everybody.</p>
<p>Maybe for some individuals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in all year of their training,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re not a high level athlete</p>
<p>or have a very specific goal that&rsquo;s right in front of you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably best to do at least 20 minutes as a minimum,</p>
<p>maybe 30 minutes of some steady state exercise once a week</p>
<p>for basically any training goal outside of again,</p>
<p>a couple of really specific scenarios that are happening.</p>
<p>The other thing that kind of kicks in here</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t really talked about</p>
<p>is now we&rsquo;re actually reaching a position</p>
<p>where fatigue of the intercostal starts to play.</p>
<p>So diaphragmic fatigue starts to run in an occasion.</p>
<p>So we forget generally breathing</p>
<p>is a contraction to open up the lungs to change pressure</p>
<p>so the air will flow in.</p>
<p>And then the exhalation is passive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a muscle has been stretched,</p>
<p>it goes back to its resting.</p>
<p>When you get to a maximum heart rate,</p>
<p>inhalation and exhalation become active.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re squeezing as hard as you can to open up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re squeezing to contract to blow air out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get fatigued, that system, right?</p>
<p>Over time, you have contracted, contracted to open up.</p>
<p>If that system starts to get fatigued,</p>
<p>you start running into failure here.</p>
<p>So you need to practice that.</p>
<p>And this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills</p>
<p>to just simply training in this fashion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs.</p>
<p>And when we say that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re really talking about.</p>
<p>The musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only other little component</p>
<p>I wanted to throw in here.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re not talking about acid buffering,</p>
<p>which in this particular case is not a problem anymore,</p>
<p>the time domain is long and slower.</p>
<p>So we have plenty of time to use fat as a fuel.</p>
<p>We also have plenty of time to use anaerobic</p>
<p>and aerobic glycolysis and clear out waste products.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t really see pH being a problem</p>
<p>with this type of exercise.</p>
<p>You may start running low on liver glycogen</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going a very long time.</p>
<p>Muscle glycogen may start getting low,</p>
<p>but not really.</p>
<p>These are huge issues.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to run into maybe a little bit</p>
<p>of a stroke volume issue,</p>
<p>but an intensity is not high enough to become a problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to break down posturally</p>
<p>or breathing mechanics than really anything else.</p>
<p>Unless again, that duration really gets</p>
<p>generally past two hours for most people.</p>
<p>So those are the things that are going to limit us.</p>
<p>So how do we improve it?</p>
<p>What do we train?</p>
<p>We went through the exercise choices.</p>
<p>You also need to make sure you&rsquo;re training</p>
<p>your intercostals.</p>
<p>We need to be training our diaphragm in some fashion.</p>
<p>Again, it can be the exercise itself,</p>
<p>can be your normal training.</p>
<p>The thing you need to be careful of here,</p>
<p>and this is actually true for all the things</p>
<p>we just talked about.</p>
<p>When we think about fatigue</p>
<p>and we think about failure and endurance,</p>
<p>we really need to pay attention to technical breakdown.</p>
<p>That is always the marker we look for.</p>
<p>So when we go through our stuff with our athletes</p>
<p>and they quote unquote fail, or they finish,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generally because we saw</p>
<p>a massive technical breakdown.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re over there.</p>
<p>Not always the case during all your round of training,</p>
<p>but this is something to really pay attention to.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on that bike and you&rsquo;re 40 seconds in</p>
<p>and all of a sudden posture starts crunching over,</p>
<p>I may stop the test.</p>
<p>I may stop the training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>What we decided failure was</p>
<p>is when you lost your technique to some sufficient level.</p>
<p>So you want to pay attention to that too,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to determine your ability</p>
<p>to perform well as well as maintain efficiency,</p>
<p>which is a really big problem here.</p>
<p>Tell me if the protocol I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>would be a reasonable one for people to incorporate.</p>
<p>60 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>of long duration work per week.</p>
<p>So one way to accomplish that that I often use</p>
<p>is to head out for a weight vested hike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a heavy weight vest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe, I think it&rsquo;s eight or 10 pounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these thinner ones.</p>
<p>And if people don&rsquo;t have access to that,</p>
<p>you can bring a backpack with some items in it.</p>
<p>I mean, it can be as simple as that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need external load.</p>
<p>It can just be your body.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>And do some hiking at a fast enough clip</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m breathing harder than I would be</p>
<p>if I just kind of shuffled along.</p>
<p>I might stop here or there, drink some water, no big deal.</p>
<p>But I can carry on a conversation if I need to.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s zone two-ish,</p>
<p>but probably pushing a little bit harder than that</p>
<p>for that duration.</p>
<p>Not a lot of deep soreness occurring after this,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of achiness</p>
<p>and some stabilization muscles that were used</p>
<p>that may not be used too much,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sitting a lot during the week.</p>
<p>Kind of reminds me of how much I&rsquo;ve been sitting.</p>
<p>But doing that all in one long afternoon,</p>
<p>typically on a weekend,</p>
<p>or doing two shorter sessions throughout the week,</p>
<p>maybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes,</p>
<p>and then working up the progression to longer duration.</p>
<p>Seems like that would be something</p>
<p>that most people should be able to do</p>
<p>and that it would weave in well</p>
<p>with any resistance training</p>
<p>or the anaerobic and aerobic output capacity work</p>
<p>that we talked about just a moment ago.</p>
<p>Great, that&rsquo;s a fine version to do it.</p>
<p>If you wanna go shorter</p>
<p>and bring up the intensity a little bit,</p>
<p>so you wanna keep it more to the 30 to 60 minute range</p>
<p>and go closer into the,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have a conversation right now,</p>
<p>but again, I&rsquo;m not at a blistering heart rate,</p>
<p>then you could probably get that same thing done</p>
<p>in a smaller time window if that was a consideration.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to blend all three of these together,</p>
<p>you have a lot of wiggle room, right?</p>
<p>So you could do something like order.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about this type of training,</p>
<p>you could do this first</p>
<p>and then finish with either one</p>
<p>of the higher intensity stuff we talked about.</p>
<p>So it could be roped into the same thing.</p>
<p>It could be its own independent day.</p>
<p>Could be your sort of active recovery day.</p>
<p>It tends to be fairly restorative</p>
<p>as you alluded to a little bit there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that big a deal</p>
<p>to do this on your quote unquote off day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re that type of person</p>
<p>who like even on your off day,</p>
<p>you have to do something physical,</p>
<p>this is fine, right?</p>
<p>If you wanted to do it on a lifting day,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a power or strength day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably fine.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do it before the workout or after,</p>
<p>either way, you&rsquo;re probably okay.</p>
<p>Probably best to do it after</p>
<p>if the primary goal</p>
<p>is one of the strength training adaptations.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not, if this is a primary goal, do it first.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do it in the combination</p>
<p>with the other interval stuff,</p>
<p>you could do it fine there.</p>
<p>You could do it before or you could do it afterwards.</p>
<p>I actually have no problem doing it afterwards</p>
<p>because that in effect,</p>
<p>especially if you say nasal only during this training</p>
<p>will help the downregulation go.</p>
<p>And so you could finish that</p>
<p>fairly well downregulated actually.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like a nice way to get thoroughly warmed up,</p>
<p>go really, really hard</p>
<p>and then give it a nice 20 to 30 minute slow back down.</p>
<p>And by the time you finish,</p>
<p>maybe even on a three minute walk.</p>
<p>Nice, slow nasal breathing.</p>
<p>Four second inhale,</p>
<p>four second inhale, maybe five.</p>
<p>So you can play with the numbers a little bit.</p>
<p>Then maybe you don&rsquo;t even need to do</p>
<p>the downregulation breathing afterwards.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be in a good spot.</p>
<p>Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do this before,</p>
<p>do your intervals, finish your intervals,</p>
<p>throw up, lay on the ground,</p>
<p>sweat all over the gym floor,</p>
<p>get up and go back to work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably not our best strategy.</p>
<p>As people are hearing this all,</p>
<p>they may be thinking,</p>
<p>wow, this is a lot of work to do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of the math here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure some of you out there are as well.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re really talking about 10 minutes</p>
<p>of running or sprinting on the bike or rower once a week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about six minutes or so</p>
<p>of the much higher intensity,</p>
<p>but short bouts divided into rounds of 20 to 20 seconds</p>
<p>to a minute with rest in between.</p>
<p>And then some longer duration workout of 30 minutes minimum,</p>
<p>but maybe as much as an hour, even two hours,</p>
<p>which in total doesn&rsquo;t really equate to that much time,</p>
<p>especially if one can access these things</p>
<p>right out their front door or at home.</p>
<p>And as we pointed out,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need any specialized equipment to do that.</p>
<p>Oh, and I forgot the muscular endurance.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t trying to cheat there.</p>
<p>Some muscular endurance thrown in as well.</p>
<p>So that brings me to a question,</p>
<p>which is if I&rsquo;m doing my training</p>
<p>for muscular endurance each week,</p>
<p>for anaerobic capacity and for maximum aerobic output</p>
<p>and long duration,</p>
<p>and given that all of that is gonna take roughly two hours</p>
<p>for the typical person total for the entire week,</p>
<p>which I would argue is going to give you back</p>
<p>so much life literally in terms of longevity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally gonna earn back years of your life.</p>
<p>Productivity, you name it.</p>
<p>Offsetting all sorts of metabolic issues</p>
<p>and enhancing your sleep and improving mood.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much data,</p>
<p>so much data pointing to all those positive benefits.</p>
<p>If I do all of these things</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m fairly consistent about them,</p>
<p>am I going to be metabolically flexible?</p>
<p>Am I going to have a well-developed fat burning,</p>
<p>carbohydrate burning system?</p>
<p>And will I be essentially fit?</p>
<p>I mean, this is not leaving aside issues of strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>which were covered in the previous episode.</p>
<p>I mean, to my mind, the ability to sprint very fast</p>
<p>if one needs to,</p>
<p>the ability to go longer duration if one needs to,</p>
<p>and the ability to do something in between</p>
<p>as well as hold a box overhead if necessary</p>
<p>while installing a shelf or something like that.</p>
<p>These are the realities of life.</p>
<p>And to me represent real functional world fitness.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>is there anything that we would want to add to this program</p>
<p>or would you consider that a fairly comprehensive</p>
<p>and complete endurance training system?</p>
<p>If we remember the target,</p>
<p>which is I want to have energy,</p>
<p>I want to look a certain way,</p>
<p>and you want to be able to do that</p>
<p>for the duration of your life,</p>
<p>for a very long life.</p>
<p>This style of training</p>
<p>where you incorporate all of those areas of endurance</p>
<p>gives you all of the necessary adaptations</p>
<p>one would need to execute all of those things.</p>
<p>Remember, fat loss or weight management</p>
<p>is not best done with any individual style of protocol.</p>
<p>So if you do a little bit of all three of these,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve checked that fat loss box.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to go out and do anything separate for it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done all the things then to cover aesthetics</p>
<p>from that side of the equation, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done the things to both enhance mitochondria,</p>
<p>to enhance blood flow,</p>
<p>increase oxygenation,</p>
<p>and manage fatigue and waste development.</p>
<p>Boom, energy&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Fatigue is there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get tired</p>
<p>or have to quit or stop or sit down</p>
<p>doing any of these activities I want.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>if you look at the literature on mortality,</p>
<p>one of the strongest predictors</p>
<p>of how long you&rsquo;re going to live is your VO2 max.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve set up a scenario</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re going to hit all three</p>
<p>of those primary goals</p>
<p>by doing a combination of this training.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to miss any plausible adaptation</p>
<p>from endurance training,</p>
<p>and you should be set for regardless of your goal.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>And as I understand,</p>
<p>totally compatible with strength and hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>provided that your goal is to also be strong</p>
<p>and also selectively hypertrophy</p>
<p>or generally hypertrophy your muscles</p>
<p>or maintain your muscles.</p>
<p>For many people that are listening to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that they have an interest</p>
<p>in building more endurance,</p>
<p>but not just the ability to go further,</p>
<p>but the ability to go a given distance</p>
<p>at a higher speed and to do it with better form</p>
<p>and to breathe better</p>
<p>and to feel better before, during and after.</p>
<p>For those folks,</p>
<p>maybe you could spell out a program</p>
<p>that combines these different elements of endurance</p>
<p>and does so in a way that informs how,</p>
<p>for instance, the higher intensity,</p>
<p>short duration sprints</p>
<p>would be expected to improve their longer duration work</p>
<p>and how perhaps their longer duration work</p>
<p>can progress if they are careful</p>
<p>to include some planks and some wall sits</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>I asked this question specifically</p>
<p>because I have to believe that</p>
<p>while there probably are some folks out there</p>
<p>that are looking to just maximize their plank</p>
<p>from week to week to week,</p>
<p>typically it seems that people fall into these categories</p>
<p>of either wanting to get stronger and get bigger muscles</p>
<p>to varying degrees or to get better at endurance</p>
<p>or to get better at everything overall.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;d really like to just focus on</p>
<p>what you think is a nice contour of a program</p>
<p>for the person that wants to get better at endurance</p>
<p>but do it with more speed, more stability</p>
<p>and just feel like a strong endurance runner,</p>
<p>cycler, swimmer,</p>
<p>or whatever happens to be their endurance event.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just give an example.</p>
<p>Maybe you wanna run your first half marathon,</p>
<p>something like that, okay?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve done it a couple of times before,</p>
<p>but you just wanna get better at that time.</p>
<p>I would probably put somewhere in the neighborhood</p>
<p>of 60 to 70% of your mileage</p>
<p>in the moderate intensity zone.</p>
<p>Okay, so you need to accumulate mileage</p>
<p>and you need to be able to handle</p>
<p>what we call the tissue tolerance.</p>
<p>So in this case,</p>
<p>your feet need to be able to handle 13 miles of pounding.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much high heart rate training you do</p>
<p>or your fat deliverability,</p>
<p>none of that matters if your feet are blown up by mile eight.</p>
<p>Okay, so in addition,</p>
<p>we talked about how even training</p>
<p>in that 70 to 85% heart rate zone</p>
<p>is quite effective at oxygen delivery,</p>
<p>fat utilization, capitalization, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to get a lot</p>
<p>of direct endurance benefits from that work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going to be working on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s honestly going to be one of your limiting factors,</p>
<p>which is that tissue tolerance and that pounding, okay?</p>
<p>In addition, you need to be efficient with your technique</p>
<p>and you need a lot of repetitions</p>
<p>for motor skill development.</p>
<p>So you wanna spend most of your time there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to recover from,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not extremely demanding and challenging.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>That leaves you with another 30 or 40% of training.</p>
<p>I would spend 10% of that in that like 22nd burst area.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna drive up fatigue extremely high</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna really maximize your ability</p>
<p>to recover from waste production.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>I would spend the remaining amount of time</p>
<p>either on a little bit of actually maximum speed stuff</p>
<p>that could actually be in the 22nd burst</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really trying to go as fast as you can</p>
<p>at the beginning of that exercise.</p>
<p>And then the rest of it, I would spend in that other zone,</p>
<p>which is more of like the five to 15 minutes,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re probably gonna wanna repeat those.</p>
<p>And this is when things like 800 meter run,</p>
<p>rest for double the time,</p>
<p>and then repeat that two or three times.</p>
<p>You actually need that in this scenario</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna need to be able to be running for two,</p>
<p>most people are gonna do a half marathon</p>
<p>for maybe around two hours or so, something like that.</p>
<p>And so you want a little bit</p>
<p>of what we call repeated endurance, right?</p>
<p>So be able to handle that higher heart rate,</p>
<p>come back down, do it again.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually how you bump your mileage up.</p>
<p>So instead of having this do more</p>
<p>of these long duration distance runs,</p>
<p>you can still get maybe five or six miles done in a day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do a one mile repeat</p>
<p>or whatever number you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>So for a lot of people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of how I would structure it.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s very similar to what we laid out</p>
<p>in the previous conversation,</p>
<p>which is getting this idea</p>
<p>that more than 50% should be basically practice.</p>
<p>A little bit of work at the very top end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>but not too much.</p>
<p>And then a little bit of work at the other end,</p>
<p>and you should be in a good spot.</p>
<p>A major mistake one would make here</p>
<p>is only doing the long duration steady state stuff</p>
<p>and just sort of saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna run five miles this week</p>
<p>and then do six miles next week and seven.</p>
<p>That might work for you.</p>
<p>I think we have enough evidence at this point,</p>
<p>both in the scientific realm,</p>
<p>as well as most of the coaches,</p>
<p>I think in this space would agree with me,</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s a suboptimal strategy.</p>
<p>So it could work, but we can do better.</p>
<p>And in terms of the structure of a program like this,</p>
<p>I realize that those structures vary tremendously.</p>
<p>Different coaches and different books</p>
<p>and different programs are gonna say,</p>
<p>oh, you should run Monday through Friday</p>
<p>with weekends off or every other day.</p>
<p>But in terms of this 70%, 30% divide,</p>
<p>where 70% is going toward the specific event,</p>
<p>doing the kind of work that you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>during the specific event</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re most interested in cultivating or improving,</p>
<p>and the remaining 30% coming from other sorts</p>
<p>of supporting work,</p>
<p>how should one think about distributing that other 30%?</p>
<p>Should it be all geared towards maximizing recovery</p>
<p>for the 70%?</p>
<p>Or in other words,</p>
<p>could I do all that 30% work on one day?</p>
<p>I probably would split it into two days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>man, coach wants me to train six days a week.</p>
<p>My schedule is tight.</p>
<p>I can pull off four to five.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>What I might say is two of those days</p>
<p>are just your tempo, right?</p>
<p>This is what like a runner would call it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like tempo training kind of in that space.</p>
<p>Remind us what tempo training is just for the uninformed.</p>
<p>It would be this like 60 to 80% effort range</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like running at probably the same stride length</p>
<p>and rate that you&rsquo;re going to run your race at,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit lower, but something similar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re practicing skill,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re accruing mileage,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting a little,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting work in for sure work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not absolutely the fastest you can sprint.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also not conversation.</p>
<p>So this would be the,</p>
<p>what before we referred to as the 10 minutes</p>
<p>of fast running or 10 minutes of fast rowing.</p>
<p>This is lower intensity than that.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>This is work accumulation.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>This is the work that you practice stuff.</p>
<p>Then one of the days a week,</p>
<p>I would probably enter in that 20 second,</p>
<p>30 second burst for a little bit of speed there.</p>
<p>And then one of the other days is when I would do that</p>
<p>true high intensity as hard as I can</p>
<p>for hitting a VO2 max, something like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably how I&rsquo;d break it up.</p>
<p>If I had like four days a week,</p>
<p>if you had five,</p>
<p>you can maybe add in another day</p>
<p>where you do more of that volume accumulation practice work.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a pretty good split.</p>
<p>So this is the point in the episode where I say,</p>
<p>thank you ever so much.</p>
<p>You provided an enormous amount of incredibly interesting,</p>
<p>clear information that&rsquo;s also actionable.</p>
<p>I do feel as if I far better understand endurance</p>
<p>in its many forms</p>
<p>and even the seller underpinnings of that.</p>
<p>And even subseller underpinnings</p>
<p>of what endurance adaptations are</p>
<p>and how to foster those through specific protocols,</p>
<p>things that not only I can do tomorrow,</p>
<p>but that I will do tomorrow.</p>
<p>And where I hit my pain points,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll understand what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>and the adaptation that I&rsquo;m triggering.</p>
<p>When my legs are burning</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m sucking for air through my mouth,</p>
<p>or I can calmly move along just through nasal breathing,</p>
<p>I will now know what&rsquo;s happening in my body</p>
<p>and the specific adaptations that I&rsquo;m triggering.</p>
<p>I think you also highlight something</p>
<p>that is vitally important</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today,</p>
<p>which is that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how one seeks out to achieve fat loss,</p>
<p>provided certain criteria are met.</p>
<p>Even while certain forms of exercise</p>
<p>tap into fat stores more than others.</p>
<p>And you beautifully illustrated</p>
<p>the relationship between energy utilization and breathing</p>
<p>and the fact that we literally exhale fat to some extent.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>So once again, thank you, thank you, and thank you.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m not alone in recognizing this information</p>
<p>as incredibly interesting and actionable.</p>
<p>And indeed, I do plan to put it into action</p>
<p>as I hope many of our listeners will as well.</p>
<p>Yet again, the pleasure is actually all mine.</p>
<p>And I actually really appreciate the fact</p>
<p>that you let me go so far into metabolism.</p>
<p>My PhD is in human bioenergetics.</p>
<p>So anytime I can go many hours into metabolism,</p>
<p>I get very excited</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t typically get that leash in this format.</p>
<p>So I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I know you understand your audience will love that,</p>
<p>hopefully.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;ll love it.</p>
<p>And I think that they&rsquo;ll especially love it</p>
<p>because they understand that if one can wrap their head</p>
<p>around even just a small fraction of the mechanisms</p>
<p>that underlie a given protocol,</p>
<p>it gives both tremendous depth and meaning to that protocol</p>
<p>and makes it so much more flexible for people</p>
<p>that can really think about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re engaging in a given protocol</p>
<p>and know exactly what they can expect in terms of results.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been on a bit of a journey here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground</p>
<p>with speed development and strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And now we walk through,</p>
<p>probably several hours here of endurance.</p>
<p>What I would love to do next</p>
<p>is to just give you a more straightforward,</p>
<p>not as much background, not as much metabolism,</p>
<p>none of the mechanisms,</p>
<p>right into protocols for someone who says,</p>
<p>look, I wanna hit those marks you keep talking about.</p>
<p>I wanna look good.</p>
<p>I wanna feel good.</p>
<p>And I wanna do that across my lifespan.</p>
<p>How would I build all these things into a protocol</p>
<p>that actually covers maybe the entire year?</p>
<p>And how would I be able to repeat that year after year?</p>
<p>So I almost have this evergreen, sustainable,</p>
<p>year-long periodization structure</p>
<p>that covers all the nodes I need to</p>
<p>if I want everything we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in these nine adaptations in this short series.</p>
<p>So I would love to do that in our next conversation.</p>
