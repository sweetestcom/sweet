    <p>The following is a conversation with Sirtesh Karaman, a professor at MIT, co founder of</p>
<p>the autonomous vehicle company, Optimus Ride, and is one of the top roboticists in the world,</p>
<p>including robots that drive and robots that fly.</p>
<p>To me personally, he has been a mentor, a colleague and a friend.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the smartest, most generous people I know.</p>
<p>So it was a pleasure and honor to finally sit down with him for this recorded conversation.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on Apple Podcast, support</p>
<p>on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break</p>
<p>the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use the code LEX PODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with</p>
<p>as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, let me mention a surprising</p>
<p>fact about physical money.</p>
<p>It costs 2.4 cents to produce a single penny.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it costs $85 million annually to produce them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crazy little fact about physical money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use the code LEX PODCAST,</p>
<p>you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping</p>
<p>to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sirtesh Karaman.</p>
<p>Since you have worked extensively on both, what is the more difficult task?</p>
<p>Autonomous flying or autonomous driving?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I think that autonomous flying, just doing it for consumer drones and so on, the kinds</p>
<p>of applications that we&rsquo;re looking at right now, is probably easier.</p>
<p>And so I think that that&rsquo;s maybe one of the reasons why it took off literally a little</p>
<p>earlier than the autonomous cars.</p>
<p>But I think if you look ahead, I would think that the real benefits of autonomous flying,</p>
<p>unleashing them in transportation, logistics, and so on, I think it&rsquo;s a lot harder than</p>
<p>autonomous driving.</p>
<p>So I think my guess is that we&rsquo;ve seen a few kind of machines fly here and there, but we</p>
<p>really haven&rsquo;t yet seen any kind of machine, like at massive scale, large scale being deployed</p>
<p>and flown and so on.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to be after we kind of resolve some of the large scale deployments</p>
<p>of autonomous driving.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the hard part?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition behind why at scale, when consumer facing drones are tough?</p>
<p>So I think in general, at scale is tough.</p>
<p>Like for example, when you think about it, we have actually deployed a lot of robots</p>
<p>in the, let&rsquo;s say the past 50 years.</p>
<p>We as academics or we business entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>I think we as humanity.</p>
<p>Humanity?</p>
<p>A lot of people working on it.</p>
<p>So we humans deployed a lot of robots.</p>
<p>And I think that, well, when you think about it, you know, robots, they&rsquo;re autonomous.</p>
<p>They work and they work on their own, but they are either like in isolated environments</p>
<p>or they are in sort of, you know, they may be at scale, but they&rsquo;re really confined to</p>
<p>a certain environment that they don&rsquo;t interact so much with humans.</p>
<p>And so, you know, they work in, I don&rsquo;t know, factory floors, warehouses, they work on Mars,</p>
<p>you know, they are fully autonomous over there.</p>
<p>But I think that the real challenge of our time is to take these vehicles and put them</p>
<p>into places where humans are present.</p>
<p>So now I know that there&rsquo;s a lot of like human robot interaction type of things that need</p>
<p>to be done.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one thing, but even just from the fundamental algorithms and systems and</p>
<p>the business cases, or maybe the business models, even like architecture, planning,</p>
<p>societal issues, legal issues, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of pack of things that are related to</p>
<p>us putting robotic vehicles into human present environments.</p>
<p>And as humans, you know, they will not potentially be even trained to interact with them.</p>
<p>They may not even be using the services that are provided by these vehicles.</p>
<p>They may not even know that they&rsquo;re autonomous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just doing their thing, living in environments that are designed for humans,</p>
<p>not for robots.</p>
<p>And that I think is one of the biggest challenges, I think, of our time to put vehicles there.</p>
<p>And you know, to go back to your question, I think doing that at scale, meaning, you</p>
<p>know, you go out in a city and you have, you know, like thousands or tens of thousands</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicles that are going around.</p>
<p>It is so dense to the point where if you see one of them, you look around, you see another</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>It is that dense.</p>
<p>And that density, we&rsquo;ve never done anything like that before.</p>
<p>And I would bet that that kind of density will first happen with autonomous cars because</p>
<p>I think, you know, we can bend the environment a little bit.</p>
<p>We can, especially kind of making them safe is a lot easier when they&rsquo;re like on the ground.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re in the air, it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s going to be a big separation.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, there will come a time that we&rsquo;re going to quickly see these</p>
<p>things unfold.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be a time where there&rsquo;s tens of thousands of delivery drones that</p>
<p>fill the sky?</p>
<p>You know, I think, I think it&rsquo;s possible to be honest.</p>
<p>Delivery drones is one thing, but you know, you can imagine for transportation, like an</p>
<p>important use case is, you know, we&rsquo;re in Boston, you want to go from Boston to New</p>
<p>York and you want to do it from the top of this building to the top of another building</p>
<p>in Manhattan.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to do it in one and a half hours.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a big opportunity, I think.</p>
<p>Personal transport.</p>
<p>So like you and me be a friend, like almost like an Uber.</p>
<p>So like four people, six people, eight people.</p>
<p>In our work in autonomous vehicles, I see that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of like a bit of a need for, you know, one person transport, but also like,</p>
<p>like a few people.</p>
<p>So you and I could take that trip together.</p>
<p>We could have lunch, you know, I think kind of sounds crazy, maybe even sounds a bit cheesy,</p>
<p>but I think that those kinds of things are some of the real opportunities.</p>
<p>And I think, you know it&rsquo;s not like the typical airplane and the airport would disappear very</p>
<p>quickly, but I would think that, you know many people would feel like they would spend</p>
<p>an extra hundred dollars on doing that and cutting that four hour travel down to one</p>
<p>and a half hours.</p>
<p>So how feasible are flying cars has been the dream.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like when people imagine the future for 50 plus years, they think flying cars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s like all technologies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheesy to think about now because it seems so far away, but overnight it can change.</p>
<p>But just technically speaking in your view, how feasible is it to make that happen?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to that question, but just one thing is that I think, you know, sometimes we think</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next 50 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really hard to guess, right?</p>
<p>Next 50 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, we could get what&rsquo;s going to happen in transportation in the next 50, we could</p>
<p>get flying saucers.</p>
<p>I could bet on that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a 50, 50 chance that, you know, like you can build machines that can</p>
<p>ionize the air around them and push it down with magnets and they would fly like a flying</p>
<p>saucer that is possible.</p>
<p>And it might happen in the next 50 years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit hard to guess like when you think about 50 years before, but I would think</p>
<p>that, you know, there&rsquo;s this, this, this kind of a notion where there&rsquo;s a certain type of</p>
<p>airspace that we call the agile airspace.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s good amount of opportunities in that airspace.</p>
<p>So that would be the space that is kind of a little bit higher than the place where you</p>
<p>can throw a stone because that&rsquo;s a tough thing when you think about it, you know, it takes</p>
<p>a kid on a stone to take an aircraft down and then what happens.</p>
<p>But you know, imagine the airspace that&rsquo;s high enough so that you cannot throw the stone,</p>
<p>but it is low enough that you&rsquo;re not interacting with the, with the very large aircraft that</p>
<p>are, you know, flying several thousand feet above.</p>
<p>And that airspace is underutilized or it&rsquo;s actually kind of not utilized at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like recreational people kind of fly every now and then, but it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>few.</p>
<p>Like if you look up in the sky, you may not see any of them at any given time, every now</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll see one airplane kind of utilizing that space and you&rsquo;ll be surprised.</p>
<p>And the moment you&rsquo;re outside of an airport a little bit, like it just kind of flies off</p>
<p>and then it goes out.</p>
<p>And I think utilizing that airspace, the technical challenges there is, you know, building an</p>
<p>autonomy and ensuring that that kind of autonomy is safe.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it is going to be building in complex software or complicated so that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe a few orders of magnitude more complicated than what we have on aircraft</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>And at the same time, ensuring just like we ensure on aircraft, ensuring that it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>And so that becomes like building that kind of complicated hardware and software becomes</p>
<p>a challenge, especially when, you know, you build that hardware, I mean, you build that</p>
<p>software with data.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s, of course there&rsquo;s some rule based software in there that kind</p>
<p>of do a certain set of things, but then, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of training there.</p>
<p>Do you think machine learning will be key to these kinds of, to delivering safe vehicles</p>
<p>in the future, especially flight?</p>
<p>Not maybe the safe part, but I think the intelligent part.</p>
<p>I mean, there are certain things that we do it with machine learning and it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like right now, no other way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how else they could be done.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s always this conundrum, I mean, we could like, could we like, we could</p>
<p>maybe gather billions of programmers, humans who program perception algorithms that detect</p>
<p>things in the sky and whatever, or, you know, we, I don&rsquo;t know, we maybe even have robots</p>
<p>like learn in a simulation environment and transfer.</p>
<p>And they might be learning a lot better in a simulation environment than a billion humans</p>
<p>put their brains together and try to program.</p>
<p>Humans pretty limited.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the role of simulations with drones?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done quite a bit of work there.</p>
<p>How promising, just the very thing you said just now, how promising is the possibility</p>
<p>of training and developing a safe flying robot in simulation and deploying it and having</p>
<p>that work pretty well in the real world?</p>
<p>I think that, you know, a lot of people, when they hear simulation, they will focus on training</p>
<p>immediately.</p>
<p>But I think one thing that you said, which was interesting, it&rsquo;s developing.</p>
<p>I think simulation environments are actually could be key and great for development.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not new.</p>
<p>Like for example, you know, there&rsquo;s people in the automotive industry have been using</p>
<p>dynamic simulation for like decades now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty standard that, you know, you would build and you would simulate.</p>
<p>If you want to build an embedded controller, you plug that kind of embedded computer into</p>
<p>another computer, that other computer would simulate dynamic and so on.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, fast forward these things, you can create pretty crazy simulation</p>
<p>environments.</p>
<p>Like for instance, one of the things that has happened recently and that, you know,</p>
<p>we can do now is that we can simulate cameras a lot better than we used to simulate them.</p>
<p>We were able to simulate them before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think we just hit the elbow on that kind of improvement.</p>
<p>I would imagine that with improvements in hardware, especially, and with improvements</p>
<p>in machine learning, I think that we would get to a point where we can simulate cameras</p>
<p>very, very well.</p>
<p>Simulate cameras means simulate how a real camera would see the real world.</p>
<p>Therefore you can explore the limitations of that.</p>
<p>You can train perception algorithms on that in simulation, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it has been easier to simulate what we would call introspective</p>
<p>sensors like internal sensors.</p>
<p>So for example, inertial sensing has been easy to simulate.</p>
<p>It has also been easy to simulate dynamics, like physics that are governed by ordinary</p>
<p>differential equations.</p>
<p>I mean, like how a car goes around, maybe how it rolls on the road, how it interacts</p>
<p>with the road, or even an aircraft flying around, like the dynamic physics of that.</p>
<p>What has been really hard has been to simulate extra septive sensors, sensors that kind of</p>
<p>like look out from the vehicle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a new thing that&rsquo;s coming like laser range finders that are a little bit</p>
<p>easier.</p>
<p>Because radars are a little bit tougher.</p>
<p>I think once we nail that down, the next challenge I think in simulation will be to simulate</p>
<p>human behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also extremely hard.</p>
<p>Even when you imagine like how a human driven car would act around, even that is hard.</p>
<p>But imagine trying to simulate, you know, a model of a human just doing a bunch of gestures</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s actually simulated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not captured like with motion capture, but it is simulated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>In fact, today I get involved a lot with like sort of this kind of very high end rendering</p>
<p>projects and I have like this test that I pass it to my friends or my mom, you know,</p>
<p>I send like two photos, two kind of pictures and I say rendered, which one is rendered,</p>
<p>which one is real.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty hard to distinguish, except I realized, except when we put humans in there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that our brains are trained in a way that we recognize humans extremely</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t so much recognize the built environments because built environments sort of came after</p>
<p>per se we evolved into sort of being humans, but humans were always there.</p>
<p>Same thing happens, for example, you look at like monkeys and you can&rsquo;t distinguish one</p>
<p>from another, but they sort of do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very possible that they look at humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of pretty hard to distinguish one from another, but we do.</p>
<p>And so our eyes are pretty well trained to look at humans and understand if something</p>
<p>is off, we will get it.</p>
<p>We may not be able to pinpoint it.</p>
<p>So in my typical friend test or mom test, what would happen is that we&rsquo;d put like a</p>
<p>human walking in anything and they say, you know, this is not right.</p>
<p>Something is off in this video.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what, but I can tell you it&rsquo;s the human.</p>
<p>I can take the human and I can show you like inside of a building or like an apartment</p>
<p>and it will look like if we had time to render it, it will look great.</p>
<p>And this should be no surprise.</p>
<p>A lot of movies that people are watching, it&rsquo;s all computer generated.</p>
<p>You know, even nowadays, even you watch a drama movie and like, there&rsquo;s nothing going</p>
<p>on action wise, but it turns out it&rsquo;s kind of like cheaper, I guess, to render the background.</p>
<p>And so they would.</p>
<p>But how do we get there?</p>
<p>How do we get a human that&rsquo;s would pass the mom slash friend test, a simulation of a human</p>
<p>walking?</p>
<p>So do you think that&rsquo;s something we can creep up to by just doing kind of a comparison learning</p>
<p>where you have humans annotate what&rsquo;s more realistic and not just by watching, like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the path?</p>
<p>Cause it seems totally mysterious how we simulate human behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard because a lot of the other things that I mentioned to you, including simulating</p>
<p>cameras, right?</p>
<p>It is, the thing there is that, you know, we know the physics, we know how it works</p>
<p>like in the real world and we can write some rules and we can do that.</p>
<p>Like for example, simulating cameras, there&rsquo;s this thing called ray tracing.</p>
<p>I mean, you literally just kind of imagine it&rsquo;s very similar to, it&rsquo;s not exactly the</p>
<p>same, but it&rsquo;s very similar to tracing photon by photon.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going around, bouncing on things and come into your eye, but human behavior, developing</p>
<p>a dynamic, like a model of that, that is mathematical so that you can put it into a processor that</p>
<p>would go through that, that&rsquo;s going to be hard.</p>
<p>And so what else do you got?</p>
<p>You can collect data, right?</p>
<p>And you can try to match the data.</p>
<p>Or another thing that you can do is that, you know, you can show the friend test, you</p>
<p>know, you can say this or that and this or that, and that will be labeling.</p>
<p>Anything that requires human labeling, ultimately we&rsquo;re limited by the number of humans that,</p>
<p>you know, we have available at our disposal and the things that they can do, you know,</p>
<p>they have to do a lot of other things than also labeling this data.</p>
<p>So that modeling human behavior part is, is I think going, we&rsquo;re going to realize it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very tough.</p>
<p>And I think that also affects, you know, our development of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>I see them in self driving as well.</p>
<p>Like you want to use, so you&rsquo;re building self driving, you know, at the first time, like</p>
<p>right after urban challenge, I think everybody focused on localization, mapping and localization,</p>
<p>you know, slam algorithms came in, Google was just doing that.</p>
<p>And so building these HD maps, basically that&rsquo;s about knowing where you are.</p>
<p>And then five years later in 2012, 2013 came the kind of coding code AI revolution.</p>
<p>And that started telling us where everybody else is, but we&rsquo;re still missing what everybody</p>
<p>else is going to do next.</p>
<p>And so you want to know where you are.</p>
<p>You want to know what everybody else is.</p>
<p>Hopefully you know that what you&rsquo;re going to do next, and then you want to predict what</p>
<p>other people are going to do.</p>
<p>And that last bit has, has been a real, real challenge.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role, your own of your, of your, the ego vehicle, the robot,</p>
<p>the you, the robotic you in controlling and having some control of how the future unrolls</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going to happen in the future.</p>
<p>That seems to be a little bit ignored in trying to predict the future is how you yourself</p>
<p>can affect that future by being either aggressive or less aggressive or signaling in some kind</p>
<p>of way.</p>
<p>So this kind of game theoretic dance seems to be ignored for the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yeah, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s totally ignored.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s quite interesting actually, like how we how we interact with things versus</p>
<p>we interact with humans.</p>
<p>Like so if, if you see a vehicle that&rsquo;s completely empty and it&rsquo;s trying to do something, all</p>
<p>of a sudden it becomes a thing.</p>
<p>So interacted with like you interact with this table and so you can throw your backpack</p>
<p>or you can kick your, kick it, put your feet on it and things like that.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s a human, there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways of interacting with a human.</p>
<p>So if you know, like you and I are face to face, we&rsquo;re very civil.</p>
<p>You know, we talk, we understand each other for the most part.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you just, you never know what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>But the thing is that like, for example, you and I might interact through YouTube comments</p>
<p>and, you know, the conversation may go at a totally different angle.</p>
<p>And so I think people kind of abusing as autonomous vehicles is a real issue in some sense.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re an ego vehicle, you&rsquo;re trying to, you know, coordinate your way,</p>
<p>make your way, it&rsquo;s actually kind of harder than being a human.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s you, you, you not only need to be as smart as, as kind of humans</p>
<p>are, but you also, you&rsquo;re a thing.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to abuse you a little bit.</p>
<p>So you need to make sure that you can get around and do something.</p>
<p>So I, in general, believe in that sort of game theoretic aspects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually personally have done, you know, quite a few papers, both on that kind of game</p>
<p>theory and also like this, this kind of understanding people&rsquo;s social value orientation, for example,</p>
<p>you know, some people are aggressive, some people not so much.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, like a robot could understand that by just looking at how people drive.</p>
<p>And as they kind of come in approach, you can actually understand, like if someone is</p>
<p>going to be aggressive or, or not as a robot and you can make certain decisions.</p>
<p>Well, in terms of predicting what they&rsquo;re going to do, the hard question is you as a</p>
<p>robot, should you be aggressive or not when faced with an aggressive robot?</p>
<p>Right now it seems like aggressive is a very dangerous thing to do because it&rsquo;s costly</p>
<p>from a societal perspective, how you&rsquo;re perceived.</p>
<p>People are not very accepting of aggressive robots in modern society.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>So that is really is.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not entirely sure like how to have to go about, but I know, I know for a fact</p>
<p>that how these robots interact with other people in there is going to be, and then interaction</p>
<p>is always going to be there.</p>
<p>I mean, you could be interacting with other vehicles or other just people kind of like</p>
<p>walking around.</p>
<p>And like I said, the moment there&rsquo;s like nobody in the seat, it&rsquo;s like an empty thing just</p>
<p>rolling off the street.</p>
<p>It becomes like no different than like any other thing that&rsquo;s not human.</p>
<p>And so people, and maybe abuse is the wrong word, but people maybe rightfully even they</p>
<p>feel like this is a human present environment designed for humans to be, and they kind of</p>
<p>they want to own it.</p>
<p>And then the robots, they would need to understand it and they would need to respond in a certain</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And I think that this actually opens up like quite a few interesting societal questions</p>
<p>for us as we deploy, like we talk robots at large scale.</p>
<p>So what would happen when we try to deploy robots at large scale, I think is that we</p>
<p>can design systems in a way that they&rsquo;re very efficient or we can design them that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very sustainable, but ultimately the sustainability efficiency trade offs, like they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be right in there and we&rsquo;re going to have to make some choices.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re not going to be able to just kind of put it aside.</p>
<p>So for example, we can be very aggressive and we can reduce transportation delays, increase</p>
<p>capacity of transportation, or we can be a lot nicer and allow other people to kind of</p>
<p>quote unquote own the environment and live in a nice place and then efficiency will drop.</p>
<p>So when you think about it, I think sustainability gets attached to energy consumption or environmental</p>
<p>impact immediately.</p>
<p>And those are there, but like livability is another sustainability impact.</p>
<p>So you create an environment that people want to live in.</p>
<p>And if, if, if robots are going around being aggressive and you don&rsquo;t want to live in that</p>
<p>environment, maybe, however, you should note that if you&rsquo;re not being aggressive, then,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re probably taking up some, some delays in transportation and this and</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re always balancing that.</p>
<p>And I think this, this choice has always been there in transportation, but I think the more</p>
<p>autonomy comes in, the more explicit the choice becomes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And when it becomes explicit, then we can start to optimize it and then we&rsquo;ll get to</p>
<p>ask the very difficult societal questions of what do we value more, efficiency or sustainability?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to have to like, I think that the interesting thing about like the</p>
<p>whole autonomous vehicles question, I think is also kind of, um, I think a lot of times,</p>
<p>you know, we have, we have focused on technology development, like hundreds of years and you</p>
<p>know, the products somehow followed and then, you know, we got to make these choices and</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>So this is, this is a good time that, you know, we even think about, you know, autonomous</p>
<p>taxi type of deployments and the systems that would evolve from there.</p>
<p>And you realize the business models are different.</p>
<p>The impact on architecture is different, urban planning, you get into like regulations, um,</p>
<p>and then you get into like these issues that you didn&rsquo;t think about before, but like sustainability</p>
<p>and ethics is like right in the middle of it.</p>
<p>I mean, even testing autonomous vehicles, like think about it, you&rsquo;re testing autonomous</p>
<p>vehicles in human present environments.</p>
<p>I mean, uh, the risk may be very small, but still, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, you know, strictly greater than zero risk that you&rsquo;re putting people into.</p>
<p>And so then you have that innovation, you know, risk trade off that you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>that somewhere.</p>
<p>Um, and we, we understand that pretty now that pretty well now is that if we don&rsquo;t test</p>
<p>the, at least the, the development will be slower.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re not going to be able to develop.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be pretty hard actually.</p>
<p>Maybe we can, we don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But the thing is that those kinds of trade offs we already are making and as these systems</p>
<p>become more ubiquitous, I think those trade offs will just really hit.</p>
<p>So you are one of the founders of Optimus Ride and autonomous vehicle company.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it, but let me on that point ask maybe a good examples, keeping Optimus</p>
<p>Ride out, out of this question, uh, sort of exemplars of different strategies on the spectrum</p>
<p>of innovation and safety or caution.</p>
<p>So like Waymo, Google self driving car Waymo represents maybe a more cautious approach.</p>
<p>And then you have Tesla on the other side headed by Elon Musk that represents a more,</p>
<p>however, which adjective you want to use, aggressive, innovative, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But uh, what, what do you think about the difference in the two strategies in your view?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more likely, what&rsquo;s needed and is more likely to succeed in the short term and in</p>
<p>the long term?</p>
<p>Definitely some sort of a balance is, is kind of the right way to go.</p>
<p>But I do think that the thing that is the most important is actually like an informed</p>
<p>public.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t mind, you know, I personally, like if I were in some place, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>so much like taking a certain amount of risk, um, some other people might.</p>
<p>And so I think the key is for people to be informed and so that they can, ideally they</p>
<p>can make a choice.</p>
<p>In some cases, that kind of choice, um, making that unanimously is of course very hard.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s actually that hard to inform people.</p>
<p>So I think in, in, in one case, like for example, even the Tesla approach, um, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to judge how informed it is, but it is somewhat informed.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, things kind of come out.</p>
<p>I think people know what they&rsquo;re taking and things like that and so on.</p>
<p>But I think the, the underlying, um, I do think that these two companies are a little</p>
<p>bit kind of representing like the, of course they, you know, one of them seems a bit safer</p>
<p>or the other one, or, you know, um, whatever the objective for that is, and the other one</p>
<p>seems more aggressive or whatever the objective for that is.</p>
<p>But, but I think, you know, when you turn the tables, they&rsquo;re actually, there are two</p>
<p>other orthogonal dimensions that these two are focusing on.</p>
<p>On the one hand for Waymo, I can see that, you know, they&rsquo;re, I mean, um, they, I think</p>
<p>they a little bit see it as research as well.</p>
<p>So they kind of, they don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not sure if they&rsquo;re like really interested in like</p>
<p>an immediate, um, product, um, you know, they, they talk about it.</p>
<p>Um, sometimes there&rsquo;s some pressure to talk about it.</p>
<p>So they, they kind of go for it, but I think, um, I think that they&rsquo;re thinking, um, maybe</p>
<p>in the back of their minds, maybe they don&rsquo;t put it this way, but I think they, they realize</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re building like a new engine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like call it the AI engine or whatever that is.</p>
<p>And you know, an autonomous vehicles is a very interesting embodiment of that engine</p>
<p>that allows you to understand where the ego vehicle is, the ego thing is where everything</p>
<p>else is, what everything else is going to do and how do you react, how do you actually,</p>
<p>you know, interact with humans the right way?</p>
<p>How do you build these systems?</p>
<p>And I think, uh, they, they want to know that they want to understand that.</p>
<p>And so they keep going and doing that.</p>
<p>And so on the other dimension, Tesla is doing something interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that they have a good product.</p>
<p>People use it.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, like it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not for me, um, but I can totally see people,</p>
<p>people like it and, and people, I think they have a good product outside of automation,</p>
<p>but I was just referring to the, the, the automation itself.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, like it, it kind of drives itself.</p>
<p>You still have to be kind of, um, you still have to pay attention to it, right?</p>
<p>Well, you know, um, people seem to use it.</p>
<p>So it works for something.</p>
<p>And so people, I think people are willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>People are willing to buy it.</p>
<p>I think it, uh, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s one of the other reasons why people buy a Tesla car.</p>
<p>Maybe one of those reasons is Elon Musk is the CEO and you know, he seems like a visionary</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people think.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great person.</p>
<p>And so that adds like 5k to the value of the car and then maybe another 5k is the autopilot</p>
<p>and, and you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, um, useful in the sense that like people are using it.</p>
<p>And so I can see Tesla and sure, of course they want to be visionary.</p>
<p>They want to kind of put out a certain approach and they may actually get there.</p>
<p>Um, but I think that there&rsquo;s also a primary benefit of doing all these updates and rolling</p>
<p>it out because, you know, people pay for it and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s basic, you</p>
<p>know, demand, supply market and people like it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re happy to pay another 5k, 10k for that novelty or whatever that is, um, they, and</p>
<p>they use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they get it and they try it a couple of times as a novelty, but they use</p>
<p>it a lot of the time.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s what Tesla is doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty different.</p>
<p>Like they, they are on pretty orthogonal dimensions of what kind of things that they&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>They are using the same AI engine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very possible that, you know, they&rsquo;re both going to be, um, sort of one day, um,</p>
<p>kind of using a similar, almost like an internal internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very bad metaphor, but similar internal combustion engine, and maybe one of them is</p>
<p>building like a car.</p>
<p>The other one is building a truck or something.</p>
<p>So ultimately the use case is very different.</p>
<p>So you, like I said, are one of the founders of Optimus, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the success stories in the autonomous vehicle space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great autonomous vehicle company.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go from the very beginning.</p>
<p>What does it take to start an autonomous vehicle company?</p>
<p>How do you go from idea to deploying vehicles like you are in a few, a bunch of places,</p>
<p>including New York?</p>
<p>I would say that I think that, you know, what happened to us is it was, was the following.</p>
<p>I think, um, we realized a lot of kind of talk in the autonomous vehicle industry back</p>
<p>in like 2014, even when we wanted to kind of get started.</p>
<p>Um, and, and I don&rsquo;t know, like I, I kind of, I would hear things like fully autonomous</p>
<p>vehicles, two years from now, three years from now, I kind of never bought it.</p>
<p>Um, you know, I was a part of, um, MIT&rsquo;s urban challenge entry.</p>
<p>Um, it kind of like, it has an interesting history.</p>
<p>So, um, I did in, in, in college and in high school, sort of a lot of mathematically oriented</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>I mean, I kind of, you know, at some point, uh, it kind of hit me.</p>
<p>I wanted to build something.</p>
<p>And so I came to MIT&rsquo;s mechanical engineering program and I now realize, I think my advisor</p>
<p>hired me because I could do like really good math, but I told him that, no, no, no, I want</p>
<p>to work on that urban challenge car.</p>
<p>I want to build the autonomous car.</p>
<p>And I think that was, that was kind of like a process where we really learned, I mean,</p>
<p>what the challenges are and what kind of limitations are we up against, you know, like having the</p>
<p>limitations of computers or understanding human behavior, there&rsquo;s so many of these things.</p>
<p>And I think it just kind of didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so, so we said, Hey, you know, like, why don&rsquo;t we take a more like a market based approach?</p>
<p>So we focus on a certain kind of market and we build a system for that.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re building is not so much of like an autonomous vehicle only, I would say.</p>
<p>So we build full autonomy into the vehicles.</p>
<p>But, you know, the way we kind of see it is that we think that the approach should actually</p>
<p>involve humans operating them, not just, just not sitting in the vehicle.</p>
<p>And I think today, what we have is today, we have one person operate one vehicle, no</p>
<p>matter what that vehicle, it could be a forklift, it could be a truck, it could be a car, whatever</p>
<p>that is.</p>
<p>And we want to go from that to 10 people operate 50 vehicles.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re referring to a world of maybe perhaps teleoperation, so can you just say what it</p>
<p>means for 10?</p>
<p>It might be confusing for people listening.</p>
<p>What does it mean for 10 people to control 50 vehicles?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, I very deliberately didn&rsquo;t call it teleoperation because what people</p>
<p>think then is that people think, away from the vehicle sits a person, sees like maybe</p>
<p>puts on goggles or something, VR and drives the car.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not at all what we mean, but we mean the kind of intelligence whereby humans</p>
<p>are in control, except in certain places, the vehicles can execute on their own.</p>
<p>And so imagine like, like a room where people can see what the other vehicles are doing</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>And you know, there will be some people who are more like, more like air traffic controllers,</p>
<p>call them like AV controllers.</p>
<p>And so these AV controllers would actually see kind of like a whole map and they would</p>
<p>understand where vehicles are really confident and where they kind of need a little bit more</p>
<p>help.</p>
<p>And the help shouldn&rsquo;t be for safety.</p>
<p>Help should be for efficiency.</p>
<p>Vehicles should be safe no matter what.</p>
<p>If you had zero people, they could be very safe, but they&rsquo;d be going five miles an hour.</p>
<p>And so if you want them to go around 25 miles an hour, then you need people to come in and,</p>
<p>and for example, you know, the vehicle come to an intersection and the vehicle can say,</p>
<p>you know, I can wait.</p>
<p>I can inch forward a little bit, show my intent, or I can turn left.</p>
<p>And right now it&rsquo;s clear I can turn, I know that, but before you give me the go, I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean necessarily we&rsquo;re doing that actually.</p>
<p>I think, I think if you go down all the, all that much detail that every intersection you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of expecting a person to press a button, then I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get the efficiency</p>
<p>benefits you want.</p>
<p>You need to be able to kind of go around and be able to do these things.</p>
<p>But, but I think you need people to be able to set high level behavior to vehicles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing with autonomous vehicles, you know, I think a lot of people kind of</p>
<p>think about it as follows.</p>
<p>I mean, this happens with technology a lot.</p>
<p>You know, you think, all right, so I know about cars and I heard robots.</p>
<p>So I think how this is going to work out is that I&rsquo;m going to buy a car, press a button</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to drive itself.</p>
<p>And when is that going to happen?</p>
<p>You know, and people kind of tend to think about it that way, but when you think about</p>
<p>what really happens is that something comes in in a way that you didn&rsquo;t even expect.</p>
<p>If asked, you might have said, I don&rsquo;t think I need that, or I don&rsquo;t think it should be</p>
<p>that and so on.</p>
<p>And then, and then that, that becomes the next big thing, coding code.</p>
<p>And so I think that this kind of different ways of humans operating vehicles could be</p>
<p>really powerful.</p>
<p>I think that sooner than later, we might open our eyes up to a world in which you go around</p>
<p>walk in a mall and there&rsquo;s a bunch of security robots that are exactly operated in this way.</p>
<p>You go into a factory or a warehouse, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of robots that are playing exactly</p>
<p>in this way.</p>
<p>You go to a, you go to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, you see a whole bunch of autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>Optimus Ride, and they&rsquo;re operated maybe in this way.</p>
<p>But I think people kind of don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>I sincerely think that there&rsquo;s a possibility that we may almost see like a whole mushrooming</p>
<p>of this technology in all kinds of places that we didn&rsquo;t expect before.</p>
<p>And that may be the real surprise.</p>
<p>And then one day when your car actually drives itself, it may not be all that much of a surprise</p>
<p>at all because you see it all the time.</p>
<p>You interact with them, you take the Optimus Ride, hopefully that&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
<p>And then you hear a bunch of things, you go around, you interact with them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like you have a little delivery vehicle that goes around the sidewalks and delivers you</p>
<p>things and then you take it, it says thank you.</p>
<p>And then you get used to that and one day your car actually drives itself and the regulation</p>
<p>goes by and you can hit the button of sleep and it wouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise at all.</p>
<p>I think that may be the real reality.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of applications that pop up around autonomous vehicles, some</p>
<p>of which, maybe many of which we don&rsquo;t expect at all.</p>
<p>So if we look at Optimus Ride, what do you think, you know, the viral application, the</p>
<p>one that like really works for people in mobility, what do you think Optimus Ride will connect</p>
<p>with in the near future first?</p>
<p>I think that the first places that I like to target honestly is like these places where</p>
<p>transportation is required within an environment, like people typically call it geofence.</p>
<p>So you can imagine like roughly two mile by two mile could be bigger, could be smaller</p>
<p>type of an environment.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of these kinds of environments that are typically transportation deprived.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard that, you know, we&rsquo;re in today, we&rsquo;re in a few different places,</p>
<p>but that was the one that was last publicized and that&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a lot of transportation there and you wouldn&rsquo;t expect like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think maybe operating an Uber there ends up being sort of a little too expensive or</p>
<p>when you compare it with operating Uber elsewhere, elsewhere becomes the priority and these places</p>
<p>become totally transportation deprived.</p>
<p>And then what happens is that, you know, people drive into these places and to go from point</p>
<p>A to point B inside this place within that day, they use their cars.</p>
<p>And so we end up building more parking for them to, for example, take their cars and</p>
<p>go to the lunch place.</p>
<p>And I think that one of the things that can be done is that, you know, you can put in</p>
<p>efficient, safe, sustainable transportation systems into these types of places first.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, you could deliver mobility in an affordable way, affordable,</p>
<p>accessible, you know, sustainable way.</p>
<p>But I think what also enables is that this kind of effort, money, area, land that we</p>
<p>spend on parking, you could reclaim some of that.</p>
<p>And that is on the order of like, even for a small environment like two mile by two mile,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be smack in the middle of New York.</p>
<p>I mean, anywhere else you&rsquo;re talking tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re smack in the middle of New York, you&rsquo;re looking at billions of dollars of savings</p>
<p>just by doing that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the economic part of it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a societal part, right?</p>
<p>I mean, just look around.</p>
<p>I mean the places that we live are like built for cars.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t look like this just like a hundred years ago, like today, no one walks in the</p>
<p>middle of the street.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for cars.</p>
<p>No one tells you that growing up, but you grow into that reality.</p>
<p>And so sometimes they close the road.</p>
<p>It happens here, you know, like the celebration, they close the road.</p>
<p>Still people don&rsquo;t walk in the middle of the road, like just walk in the middle and people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I think it has so much impact, the car in the space that we have.</p>
<p>And I think we talked about sustainability, livability.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately these kinds of places that parking spots at the very least could change</p>
<p>into something more useful or maybe just like park areas, recreational.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the first thing that we&rsquo;re targeting.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re getting like a really good response, both from an economic societal</p>
<p>point of view, especially places that are a little bit forward looking.</p>
<p>And like, for example, Brooklyn Navy Yard, they have tenants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s distinct direct call like new lab.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like an innovation center.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of startups there.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you get those kinds of people and, you know, they&rsquo;re really interested</p>
<p>in sort of making that environment more livable.</p>
<p>And these kinds of solutions that Optimus Ride provides almost kind of comes in and</p>
<p>becomes that.</p>
<p>And many of these places that are transportation deprived, you know, they have, they actually</p>
<p>rent shuttles.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you can ask anybody, the shuttle experience is like terrible.</p>
<p>People hate shuttles.</p>
<p>And I can tell you why.</p>
<p>Because, you know, like the driver is very expensive in a shuttle business.</p>
<p>So what makes sense is to attach 20, 30 seats to a driver.</p>
<p>And a lot of people have this misconception.</p>
<p>They think that shuttles should be big.</p>
<p>Sometimes we get that at Optimus Ride.</p>
<p>We tell them, we&rsquo;re going to give you like four seaters, six seaters.</p>
<p>And we get asked like, how about like 20 seaters?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know, you don&rsquo;t need 20 seaters.</p>
<p>You want to split up those seats so that they can travel faster and the transportation delays</p>
<p>would go down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>If you make it big, not only you will get delays in transportation, but you won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>an agile vehicle.</p>
<p>It will take a long time to speed up, slow down and so on.</p>
<p>You need to climb up to the thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like really hard to interact with.</p>
<p>And scheduling too, perhaps when you have more smaller vehicles, it becomes closer to</p>
<p>Uber where you can actually get a personal, I mean, just the logistics of getting the</p>
<p>vehicle to you becomes easier when you have a giant shuttle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fewer of them and it probably goes on a route, a specific route that is supposed</p>
<p>to hit.</p>
<p>And when you go on a specific route and all seats travel together versus, you know, you</p>
<p>have a whole bunch of them.</p>
<p>You can imagine the route you can still have, but you can imagine you split up the seats</p>
<p>and instead of, you know, them traveling, like, I don&rsquo;t know, a mile apart, they could</p>
<p>be like, you know, half a mile apart if you split them into two.</p>
<p>That basically would mean that your delays, when you go out, you won&rsquo;t wait for them for</p>
<p>a long time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons, or you don&rsquo;t have to climb up.</p>
<p>The other thing is that I think if you split them up in a nice way, and if you can actually</p>
<p>know where people are going to be somehow, you don&rsquo;t even need the app.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask us the app, we say, why don&rsquo;t you just walk into the vehicle?</p>
<p>How about you just walk into the vehicle, it recognizes who you are and it gives you</p>
<p>a bunch of options of places that you go and you just kind of go there.</p>
<p>I mean, people kind of also internalize the apps.</p>
<p>Everybody needs an app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t need an app.</p>
<p>You just walk into the thing.</p>
<p>But I think one of the things that, you know, we really try to do is to take that shuttle</p>
<p>experience that no one likes and tilt it into something that everybody loves.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s another important thing.</p>
<p>I would like to say that carefully, just like teleoperation, like we don&rsquo;t do shuttles.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re really kind of thinking of this as a system or a network that we&rsquo;re designing.</p>
<p>But ultimately, we go to places that would normally rent a shuttle service that people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t like as much and we want to tilt it into something that people love.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned this earlier, but how many Optimus ride vehicles do you think would</p>
<p>be needed for any person in Boston or New York, if they step outside, there will be,</p>
<p>this is like a mathematical question, there&rsquo;ll be two Optimus ride vehicles within line of</p>
<p>sight.</p>
<p>Is that the right number to, well, at least one.</p>
<p>For example, that&rsquo;s the density.</p>
<p>So meaning that if you see one vehicle, you look around, you see another one too.</p>
<p>Imagine like, you know, Tesla would tell you they collect a lot of data.</p>
<p>Do you see that with Tesla?</p>
<p>Like you just walk around and you look around, you see Tesla?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Very specific areas of California, maybe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a couple of zip codes that, you know, but I think that&rsquo;s kind of important</p>
<p>because you know, like maybe the couple of zip codes, the one thing that we kind of depend</p>
<p>on and I&rsquo;ll get to your question in a second, but now like we&rsquo;re taking a lot of tensions</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>And so I think that this is actually important.</p>
<p>People call this data density or data velocity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very good to collect data in a way that, you know, you see the same place so</p>
<p>many times.</p>
<p>Like you can drive 10,000 miles around the country or you drive 10,000 miles in a confined</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the same intersection hundreds of times.</p>
<p>And when it comes to predicting what people are going to do in that specific intersection,</p>
<p>you become really good at it versus if you draw in like 10,000 miles around the country,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen that only once.</p>
<p>And so trying to predict what people do becomes hard.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, you said what is needed, it&rsquo;s tens of thousands of vehicles.</p>
<p>You know, you really need to be like a specific fractional vehicle.</p>
<p>Like for example, in good times in Singapore, you can go and you can just grab a cab and</p>
<p>they are like, you know, 10%, 20% of traffic, those taxis.</p>
<p>Ultimately that&rsquo;s where you need to get to.</p>
<p>So that, you know, you get to a certain place where you really, the benefits really kick</p>
<p>off in like orders of magnitude type of a point.</p>
<p>But once you get there, you actually get the benefits.</p>
<p>And you can certainly carry people.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the things people really don&rsquo;t like to wait for themselves.</p>
<p>But for example, they can wait a lot more for the goods if they order something.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re sitting at home and you want to wait half an hour.</p>
<p>That sounds great.</p>
<p>People will say it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You want to, you&rsquo;re going to take a cab, you&rsquo;re waiting half an hour.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to wait that much.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, you can, I think really get to a point where the system at peak times</p>
<p>really focuses on kind of transporting humans around.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s a good fraction of the traffic to the point where, you know,</p>
<p>you go, you look around and there&rsquo;s something there and you just kind of basically get in</p>
<p>there and it&rsquo;s already waiting for you or something like that.</p>
<p>And then you take it.</p>
<p>If you do it at that scale, like today, for instance, Uber, if you talk to a driver, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Uber takes a certain cut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small cut.</p>
<p>Or drivers would argue that it&rsquo;s a large cut, but you know, it&rsquo;s when you look at the grand</p>
<p>scheme of things, most of that money that you pay Uber kind of goes to the driver.</p>
<p>And if you talk to the driver, the driver will claim that most of it is their time.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not spent on gas.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s not spent on the car per se as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like their time.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t have a person driving, or if you&rsquo;re in a scenario where, you know, like</p>
<p>0.1 person is driving the car, a fraction of a person is kind of operating the car because</p>
<p>you know, you want to operate several.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in that situation, you realize that the internal combustion engine type of cars</p>
<p>are very inefficient.</p>
<p>You know, we build them to go on highways, they pass crash tests.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like really heavy.</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t need to be like 25 times the weight of its passengers or, you know,</p>
<p>like area wise and so on.</p>
<p>But if you get through those inefficiencies and if you really build like urban cars and</p>
<p>things like that, I think the economics really starts to check out.</p>
<p>Like to the point where, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, you may be able to get into a car and it may</p>
<p>be less than a dollar to go from A to B. As long as you don&rsquo;t change your destination,</p>
<p>you just pay 99 cents and go there.</p>
<p>If you share it, if you take another stop somewhere, it becomes a lot better.</p>
<p>You know, these kinds of things, at least for models, at least for mathematics and theory,</p>
<p>they start to really check out.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really exciting what Optimus Ride is doing in terms of it feels the most</p>
<p>reachable, like it&rsquo;ll actually be here and have an impact.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is the idea.</p>
<p>And if we contrast that, again, we&rsquo;ll go back to our old friends, Waymo and Tesla.</p>
<p>So Waymo seems to have sort of technically similar approaches as Optimus Ride, but a</p>
<p>different, they&rsquo;re not as interested as having impact today.</p>
<p>They have a longer term sort of investments, almost more of a research project still, meaning</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to solve, as far as I understand, maybe you can differentiate, but they seem</p>
<p>to want to do more unrestricted movement, meaning move from A to B where A to B is all</p>
<p>over the place versus Optimus Ride is really nicely geofenced and really sort of established</p>
<p>mobility in a particular environment before you expand it.</p>
<p>And then Tesla is like the complete opposite, which is, you know, the entirety of the world</p>
<p>actually is going to be automated.</p>
<p>Highway driving, urban driving, every kind of driving, you know, you kind of creep up</p>
<p>to it by incrementally improving the capabilities of the autopilot system.</p>
<p>So when you contrast all of these, and on top of that, let me throw a question that</p>
<p>nobody likes, but is a timeline.</p>
<p>When do you think each of these approaches, loosely speaking, nobody can predict the future,</p>
<p>will see mass deployment?</p>
<p>So Elon Musk predicts the craziest approach is, I&rsquo;ve heard figures like at the end of</p>
<p>this year, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably wildly inaccurate, but how wildly inaccurate is it?</p>
<p>I mean, first thing to lay out, like everybody else, it&rsquo;s really hard to guess.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know where Tesla can look at or Elon Musk can look at and say, hey,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the end of this year.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what you can look at.</p>
<p>You know, even the data that, I mean, if you look at the data, even kind of trying to extrapolate</p>
<p>the end state without knowing what exactly is going to go, especially for like a machine</p>
<p>learning approach.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just kind of very hard to predict.</p>
<p>But I do think the following does happen.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people, you know, what they do is that there&rsquo;s something that I called</p>
<p>a couple times time dilation in technology prediction happens.</p>
<p>Let me try to describe a little bit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that are so far ahead, people think they&rsquo;re close.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are actually close.</p>
<p>People think it&rsquo;s far ahead.</p>
<p>People try to kind of look at a whole landscape of technology development, admittedly, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chaos.</p>
<p>Anything can happen in any order at any time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of things in there.</p>
<p>People take it, clamp it, and put it into the next three years.</p>
<p>And so then what happens is that there&rsquo;s some things that maybe can happen by the end of</p>
<p>the year or next year and so on.</p>
<p>And they push that into like few years ahead, because it&rsquo;s just hard to explain.</p>
<p>And there are things that are like, we&rsquo;re looking at 20 years more, maybe, you know,</p>
<p>hopefully in my lifetime type of things, because, you know, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t know how hard it is even.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know like if some of these problems are actually AI complete, like, we have no</p>
<p>idea what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And you know, we take all of that and then we clump it.</p>
<p>And then we say three years from now.</p>
<p>And then some of us are more optimistic.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re shooting at the end of the year and some of us are more realistic.</p>
<p>They say like five years, but you know, we all, I think it&rsquo;s just hard to know.</p>
<p>And I think trying to predict like products ahead two, three years, it&rsquo;s hard to know</p>
<p>in the following sense.</p>
<p>You know, like we typically say, okay, this is a technology company, but sometimes, sometimes</p>
<p>really you&rsquo;re trying to build something where the technology does, like there&rsquo;s a technology</p>
<p>gap, you know, like, and Tesla had that with electric vehicles, you know, like when they</p>
<p>first started, they would look at a chart much like a Moore&rsquo;s law type of chart.</p>
<p>And they would just kind of extrapolate that out and they&rsquo;d say, we want to be here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the technology to get that?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It goes like this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going to, you know, keep going with AI that goes into the cars.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have that.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t, we can&rsquo;t, I mean, what can you quantify, like what kind of chart are</p>
<p>you looking at?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>But so, but so I think when there&rsquo;s that technology gap, it&rsquo;s just kind of really hard to predict.</p>
<p>So now I realize I talked like five minutes and avoid your question.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell you anything about that and it was very skillfully done.</p>
<p>That was very well done.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you, I think you&rsquo;ve actually argued that it&rsquo;s not a use, even any answer</p>
<p>you provide now is not that useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing that I really believe in and, um, and you know, this is not my idea</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been, you know, discussed several times, but, but this, um, this, this kind</p>
<p>of like something like a startup, um, or, or a kind of an innovative company, um, including</p>
<p>definitely may one, may Waymo, Tesla, maybe even some of the other big companies that</p>
<p>are kind of trying things.</p>
<p>This kind of like iterated learning is very important.</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;re over there and we&rsquo;re trying things and so on, I think that&rsquo;s, um, that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>We try to understand.</p>
<p>And, and I think that, you know, the code in code Silicon Valley has done that with</p>
<p>business models pretty well.</p>
<p>And now I think we&rsquo;re trying to get to do it, but there&rsquo;s a literal technology gap.</p>
<p>I mean, before, like, you know, you&rsquo;re trying to build, I&rsquo;m not trying to, you know, I think</p>
<p>these companies are building great technology to, for example, enable internet search to</p>
<p>do it so quickly.</p>
<p>And that kind of didn&rsquo;t, didn&rsquo;t, wasn&rsquo;t there so much, but at least like it was a kind of</p>
<p>a technology that you could predict to some degree and so on.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re just kind of trying to build, you know, things that it&rsquo;s kind of hard to</p>
<p>quantify what kind of a metric are we looking at?</p>
<p>So psychologically as a sort of a, as a leader of graduate students and at Optimus ride a</p>
<p>bunch of brilliant engineers, just curiosity, psychologically, do you think it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>think that, you know, whatever technology gap we&rsquo;re talking about can be closed by the</p>
<p>end of the year or do you, you know, cause we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So the way, do you want to say that everything is going to improve exponentially to yourself</p>
<p>and to others around you as a leader, or do you want to be more sort of maybe not cynical,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to use realistic cause it&rsquo;s hard to predict, but yeah, maybe more cynical,</p>
<p>pessimistic about the ability to close that gap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, going back, I think that iterated learning is like key that, you</p>
<p>know, you&rsquo;re out there, you&rsquo;re running experiments to learn.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean sort of like, you know, like, like your Optimus ride, you&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of doing something, but like in an environment, but like what Tesla is doing, I think is also</p>
<p>kind of like this, this kind of notion.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, people can go around and say like, you know, this year, next year,</p>
<p>the other year and so on.</p>
<p>But, but I think that the nice thing about it is that they&rsquo;re out there, they&rsquo;re pushing</p>
<p>this technology in.</p>
<p>I think what they should do more of, I think that kind of informed people about what kind</p>
<p>of technology that they&rsquo;re providing, you know, the good and the bad.</p>
<p>And then, you know, not just sort of, you know, it works very well, but I think, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re not doing bad and informing, I think they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of trying, they, you know, they put up certain things or at the very least YouTube videos</p>
<p>comes out on, on how the summon function works every now and then, and, and, you know, people</p>
<p>get informed and so that, that kind of cycle continues, but I, you know, I, I admire it.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re kind of go out there and they, they do great things.</p>
<p>They do their own kind of experiment.</p>
<p>I think we do our own and I think we&rsquo;re closing some similar technology gaps, but some also</p>
<p>some are orthogonal as well.</p>
<p>You know, I think like, like we talked about, you know, people being remote, like it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>or in the kind of environments that we&rsquo;re in or think about a Tesla car, maybe, maybe</p>
<p>you can enable it one day.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, you know, low traffic, like you&rsquo;re kind of the stop on go motion, you</p>
<p>just hit the button and the, you can release, or maybe there&rsquo;s another lane that you can</p>
<p>pass into, you go in that.</p>
<p>I think they can enable these kinds of, I believe it.</p>
<p>And so I think that that part, that is really important and that is really key.</p>
<p>And beyond that, I think, you know, when is it exactly going to happen and, and, and so</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s like I said, it&rsquo;s very hard to predict.</p>
<p>And I would, I would imagine that it would be good to do some sort of like a, like a</p>
<p>one or two year plan when it&rsquo;s a little bit more predictable that, you know, the technology</p>
<p>gaps you close and, and the, and the kind of sort of product that would ensue.</p>
<p>So I know that from Optimus ride or, you know, other companies that I get involved in.</p>
<p>I mean, at some point you find yourself in a situation where you&rsquo;re trying to build a</p>
<p>product and, and people are investing in that, in that, you know, building effort and those</p>
<p>investors that they do want to know as they compare the investments they want to make,</p>
<p>they do want to know what happens in the next one or two years.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s good to communicate that.</p>
<p>But I think beyond that, it becomes, it becomes a vision that we want to get to someday and</p>
<p>saying five years, 10 years, I don&rsquo;t think it means anything.</p>
<p>But iterative learning is key to do and learn.</p>
<p>I think that is key.</p>
<p>You know, I got to sort of throw back right at you criticism in terms of, you know, like</p>
<p>Tesla or somebody communicating, you know, how someone works and so on.</p>
<p>I got a chance to visit Optimus ride and you guys are doing some awesome stuff and yet</p>
<p>the internet doesn&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>So you should also communicate more showing off, you know, showing off some of the awesome</p>
<p>stuff, the stuff that works and stuff that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just the stuff I saw with the tracking of different objects and pedestrians.</p>
<p>So I mean, incredible stuff going on there.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just the nerd in me, but I think the world would love to see that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s well taken.</p>
<p>Um, you know, I, I should say that it&rsquo;s not like, you know, we, we, we weren&rsquo;t able to,</p>
<p>I think we made a decision at some point, um, that decision did involve me quite a bit</p>
<p>on kind of, um, uh, sort of doing this in kind of coding code stealth mode for a bit.</p>
<p>Um, but I think that, you know, we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll open it up quite a lot more.</p>
<p>And I think that we are also at Optimus ride kind of hitting, um, when you have new era,</p>
<p>um, you know, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re big now, we&rsquo;re doing a lot of interesting things and</p>
<p>I think, you know, some of the deployments that we&rsquo;ve kind of announced were some of</p>
<p>the first bits, bits of, um, information that we kind of put out into the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also put out our technology, a lot of the things that we&rsquo;ve been developing is really</p>
<p>amazing.</p>
<p>And then, you know, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re gonna, we&rsquo;re gonna start putting that out now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re especially interested in sort of like, um, being able to work with the best people.</p>
<p>And I think, and I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s good to not just kind of show them when they come</p>
<p>to our office for an interview, but just put it out there in terms of like, you know, get</p>
<p>people excited about what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So on the autonomous vehicle space, let me ask one last question.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk famously said that lighter is a crutch.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked to a bunch of people about it, got to ask you, you use that crutch quite</p>
<p>a bit in the DARPA days.</p>
<p>So, uh, uh, you know, and his, his idea in general, sort of, you know, more provocative</p>
<p>and fun, I think than a technical discussion, but the idea is that camera based, primarily</p>
<p>camera based systems is going to be what defines the future of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>So what do you think of this idea?</p>
<p>Lighter is a crutch versus primarily, uh, camera based systems.</p>
<p>First things first, I think, you know, I&rsquo;m a big believer in just camera based autonomous</p>
<p>vehicle systems.</p>
<p>Um, I think that, you know, you can put in a lot of autonomy and, and you can do great</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And, and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very possible that at the time scales, like I said, we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>predict 20 years from now, like you may be able to do, do things that we&rsquo;re doing today</p>
<p>only with LIDAR and then you may be able to do them just with cameras.</p>
<p>And I think that, um, you know, you, you can just, um, I, I, I think that I will put my</p>
<p>name on it too.</p>
<p>You know, there will be a time when you can only use cameras and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Um, at that time though, it&rsquo;s very possible that, you know, you find the LIDAR system</p>
<p>as another robustifier or, or it&rsquo;s so affordable that it&rsquo;s stupid not to, you know, just kind</p>
<p>of put it there.</p>
<p>And I think, um, and I think we may be looking at a future like that.</p>
<p>You think we&rsquo;re over relying on LIDAR right now, because we understand the better it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more reliable in many ways in terms of, from a safety perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to build with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other, that&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>I think to be very frank with you, I mean, um, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of sort of</p>
<p>autonomous vehicles companies come and go and the approach has been, you know, you slap</p>
<p>a LIDAR on a car and it&rsquo;s kind of easy to build with when you have a LIDAR, you know,</p>
<p>you just kind of code it up and, and you hit the button and you do a demo.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s admittedly, there&rsquo;s a lot of people, they focus on the LIDAR cause it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easier to build with.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that, you know, without the camera, just cameras, you can, uh, you</p>
<p>cannot do what they&rsquo;re doing, but it&rsquo;s just kind of a lot harder.</p>
<p>And so you need to have certain kinds of expertise to exploit that.</p>
<p>What we believe in and, you know, you may be seeing some of it is that, um, we believe</p>
<p>in computer vision.</p>
<p>We certainly work on computer vision and Optimus ride, uh, by a lot, like, um, and, and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing that from day one.</p>
<p>And we also believe in sensor fusion.</p>
<p>So, you know, we, we do, we have a relatively minimal use of LIDARs, but, but we do use</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, in the future, I really believe that the following sequence of events</p>
<p>may happen.</p>
<p>First things first, number one, there may be a future in which, you know, there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>cars with LIDARs and everything and the cameras, but you know, this in this 50 year ahead future,</p>
<p>they can just drive with cameras as well.</p>
<p>Especially in some isolated environments and cameras, they go and they do the thing in</p>
<p>the same future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that, you know, the LIDARs are so cheap and frankly make the software</p>
<p>maybe, um, a little less compute intensive, uh, at the very least, or maybe less complicated</p>
<p>so that they can be certified or, or insured, they&rsquo;re of their safety and things like that,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of stupid not to put the LIDAR, like, imagine this, you either put, pay money</p>
<p>for the LIDAR or you pay money for the compute.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t put the LIDAR, it&rsquo;s a more expensive system because you have to put in</p>
<p>a lot of compute.</p>
<p>Like, this is another possibility.</p>
<p>Um, I do think that a lot of the, um, sort of initial deployments of self driving vehicles,</p>
<p>I think they will involve LIDARs and especially either low range or short, um, either short</p>
<p>range or low resolution LIDARs are actually not that hard to build in solid state.</p>
<p>Uh, they&rsquo;re still scanning, but like MEMS type of scanning LIDARs and things like that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re actually not that hard.</p>
<p>I think they will maybe kind of playing with the spectrum and the phase arrays that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a little bit harder, but, but I think, um, like, you know, putting a MEMS mirror in there</p>
<p>that kind of scans the environment, it&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>The only thing is that, you know, you, just like with a lot of the things that we do nowadays</p>
<p>in developing technology, you hit fundamental limits of the universe, um, the speed of light</p>
<p>becomes a problem in when you&rsquo;re trying to scan the environment.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get either good resolution or you don&rsquo;t get range.</p>
<p>Um, but, but you know, it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s something that you can put in there affordably.</p>
<p>So let me jump back to, uh, drones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, uh, you have a role in the Lockheed Martin Alpha Pilot Innovation Challenge.</p>
<p>Where, uh, teams compete in drone racing and super cool, super intense, interesting application</p>
<p>of AI.</p>
<p>So can you tell me about the very basics of the challenge and where you fit in, what your</p>
<p>thoughts are on this problem?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of echoes of the early DARPA challenge in the, through the desert that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing now, now with drone racing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, one interesting thing about it is that, you know, people, the drone racing exists</p>
<p>as an eSport.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s much like you&rsquo;re playing a game, but there&rsquo;s a real drone going in an environment.</p>
<p>A human being is controlling it with goggles on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, it is a robot, but there&rsquo;s no AI.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no AI.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Human being is controlling it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>And, um, and I&rsquo;ve been interested in this problem for quite a while, actually, um, from</p>
<p>a roboticist point of view.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in Alpha Pilot, which, which problem of aggressive flight</p>
<p>of aggressive flight, fully autonomous, aggressive flight.</p>
<p>Um, the problem that I&rsquo;m interested, I mean, you asked about Alpha Pilot and I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get there in a second, but the problem that I&rsquo;m interested in, I&rsquo;d love to build autonomous</p>
<p>vehicles like, like drones that can go far faster than any human possibly can.</p>
<p>I think we should recognize that we as humans have, you know, limitations in how fast we</p>
<p>can process information.</p>
<p>And those are some biological limitations.</p>
<p>Like we think about this AI this way too.</p>
<p>I mean, this has been discussed a lot and this is not sort of my idea per se, but a</p>
<p>lot of people kind of think about human level AI and they think that, you know, AI is not</p>
<p>human level.</p>
<p>One day it&rsquo;ll be human level and humans and AI&rsquo;s, they kind of interact.</p>
<p>Um, versus I think that the situation really is that humans are at a certain place and</p>
<p>AI keeps improving and at some point it just crosses off and then, you know, it gets smarter</p>
<p>and smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>And so drone racing, the same issue.</p>
<p>Just play this game and you know, you have to like react in milliseconds and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really, you know, you see something with your eyes and then that information just flows</p>
<p>through your brain, into your hands so that you can command it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some also delays on, you know, getting information back and forth, but suppose</p>
<p>those delays didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>You just, just the delay between your eye and your fingers is a delay that a robot doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to have.</p>
<p>Um, so we end up building in my research group, like systems that, you know, see things at</p>
<p>a kilohertz, like a human eye would barely hit a hundred Hertz.</p>
<p>So imagine things that see stuff in slow motion, like 10 X slow motion.</p>
<p>Um, it will be very useful.</p>
<p>Like we talked a lot about autonomous cars.</p>
<p>So, um, you know, we don&rsquo;t get to see it, but a hundred lives are lost every day, just</p>
<p>in the United States on traffic accidents.</p>
<p>And many of them are like known cases, you know, like the, uh, you&rsquo;re coming through</p>
<p>like, uh, like a ramp going into a highway, you hit somebody and you&rsquo;re off, or, you know,</p>
<p>like you kind of get confused.</p>
<p>You try to like swerve into the next lane, you go off the road and you crash, whatever.</p>
<p>And um, I think if you had enough compute in a car and a very fast camera right at the</p>
<p>time of an accident, you could use all compute you have, like you could shut down the infotainment</p>
<p>system and use that kind of computing resources instead of rendering, you use it for the kind</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence that goes in there, the autonomy.</p>
<p>And you can, you can either take control of the car and bring it to a full stop.</p>
<p>But even, even if you can&rsquo;t do that, you can deliver what the human is trying to do.</p>
<p>Human is trying to change the lane, but goes off the road, not being able to do that with</p>
<p>motor skills and the eyes.</p>
<p>And you know, you can get in there and I was, there&rsquo;s so many other things that you can</p>
<p>enable with what I would call high throughput computing.</p>
<p>You know, data is coming in extremely fast and in real time you have to process it.</p>
<p>And the current CPUs, however fast you clock it are typically not enough.</p>
<p>You need to build those computers from the ground up so that they can ingest all that</p>
<p>data that I&rsquo;m really interested in.</p>
<p>Just on that point, just really quick is the currently what&rsquo;s the bottom, like you mentioned</p>
<p>the delays in humans, is it the hardware?</p>
<p>So you work a lot with Nvidia hardware.</p>
<p>Is it the hardware or is it the software?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>In fact, they need to be co developed I think in the future.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a little bit what Nvidia does sort of like they almost like build the hardware</p>
<p>and then they build the neural networks and then they build the hardware back and the</p>
<p>neural networks back and it goes back and forth, but it&rsquo;s that co design.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, like we try to way back, we try to build a fast drone that</p>
<p>could use a camera image to like track what&rsquo;s moving in order to find where it is in the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>This typical sort of, you know, visual inertial state estimation problems that we would solve.</p>
<p>And you know, we just kind of realized that we&rsquo;re at the limit sometimes of, you know,</p>
<p>doing simple tasks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at the limit of the camera frame rate because you know, if you really want to track</p>
<p>things, you want the camera image to be 90% kind of like, or some somewhat the same from</p>
<p>one frame to the next.</p>
<p>And why are we at the limit of the camera frame rate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because camera captures data.</p>
<p>It puts it into some serial connection.</p>
<p>It could be USB or like there&rsquo;s something called camera serial interface that we use</p>
<p>a lot.</p>
<p>It puts into some serial connection and copper wires can only transmit so much data.</p>
<p>And you hit the channel limit on copper wires and you know, you, you hit yet another kind</p>
<p>of universal limit that you can transfer the data.</p>
<p>So you have to be much more intelligent on how you capture those pixels.</p>
<p>You can take compute and put it right next to the pixels.</p>
<p>People are building those.</p>
<p>How hard is it to do?</p>
<p>How hard is it to get past the bottleneck of the copper wire?</p>
<p>Yeah, you need to, you need to do a lot of parallel processing, as you can imagine.</p>
<p>The same thing happens in the GPUs, you know, like the data is transferred in parallel somehow.</p>
<p>It gets into some parallel processing.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, like now we&rsquo;re really kind of diverted off into so many different</p>
<p>dimensions, but.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s aggressive flight.</p>
<p>How do we make drones see many more frames a second in order to enable aggressive flight?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a super interesting problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting problem.</p>
<p>So, but like, think about it.</p>
<p>You have, you have CPUs.</p>
<p>You clock them at, you know, several gigahertz.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t clock them faster, largely because, you know, we run into some heating issues</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But the whole thing is that three gigahertz clock light travels kind of like on the order</p>
<p>of a few inches or an inch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the size of a chip.</p>
<p>And so you pass a clock cycle and as the clock signal is going around in the chip, you pass</p>
<p>another one.</p>
<p>And so trying to coordinate that, the design of the complexity of the chip becomes so hard.</p>
<p>I mean, we have hit the fundamental limits of the universe in so many things that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>designing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people realize that.</p>
<p>Like, we can&rsquo;t make transistors smaller because like quantum effects, the electrons start</p>
<p>to tunnel around.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t clock it faster.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why is because like information doesn&rsquo;t travel faster in the universe and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re limited by that.</p>
<p>Same thing with the laser scanner.</p>
<p>But so then it becomes clear that, you know, the way you organize the chip into a CPU or</p>
<p>even a GPU, you now need to look at how to redesign that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to stick with Silicon, you could go do other things too.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s that too, but you really almost need to take those transistors, put them in</p>
<p>a different way so that the information travels on those transistors in a different way, in</p>
<p>a much more way that is specific to the high speed cameras coming in.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one of the things that we talk about quite a bit.</p>
<p>So drone racing kind of really makes that embodies that and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting for people, you know, students like it.</p>
<p>It embodies all those problems.</p>
<p>But going back, we&rsquo;re building, quote, unquote, another engine.</p>
<p>And that engine, I hope one day will be just like how impactful seat belts were in driving.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>Or it could enable, you know, next generation autonomous air taxis and things like that.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds crazy, but one day we may need to perch land these things.</p>
<p>If you really want to go from Boston to New York in more than a half hours, you may want</p>
<p>to fix wing aircraft.</p>
<p>Most of these companies that are kind of doing quote unquote flying cars, they&rsquo;re focusing</p>
<p>on that.</p>
<p>But then how do you land it on top of a building?</p>
<p>You may need to pull off like kind of fast maneuvers for a robot, like perch land.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go perch into a building.</p>
<p>If you want to do that, like you need these kinds of systems.</p>
<p>And so drone racing, you know, it&rsquo;s being able to go way faster than any human can comprehend.</p>
<p>Take an aircraft, forget the quadcopter, you take your fixed wing, while you&rsquo;re at it,</p>
<p>you might as well put some like rocket engines in the back and you just light it.</p>
<p>You go through the gate and a human looks at it and just said, what just happened?</p>
<p>And they would say, it&rsquo;s impossible for me to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s closing the same technology gap that would, you know, one day steer cars out</p>
<p>of accidents.</p>
<p>So but then let&rsquo;s get back to the practical, which is sort of just getting the thing to</p>
<p>to work in a race environment, which is kind of what the is another kind of exciting thing,</p>
<p>which the DARPA challenge to the desert did, you know, theoretically, we had autonomous</p>
<p>vehicles, but making them successfully finish a race, first of all, which nobody finished</p>
<p>the first year, and then the second year just to get, you know, to finish and go at a reasonable</p>
<p>time is really difficult engineering, practically speaking challenge.</p>
<p>So that let me ask about the the the Alpha pilot challenge is a, I guess, a big prize</p>
<p>potentially associated with it.</p>
<p>But let me ask, reminiscent of the DARPA days, predictions, you think anybody will finish?</p>
<p>Well, not, not soon.</p>
<p>I think that depends on how you set up the race course.</p>
<p>And so if the race course is a solo course, I think people will kind of do it.</p>
<p>But can you set up some course, like literally some core, you get to design it is the algorithm</p>
<p>developer, can you set up some course, so that you can be the best human?</p>
<p>When is that going to happen?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not very easy, even just setting up some course, if you let the human that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re competing with set up the course, it becomes a lot easier, a lot harder.</p>
<p>So how many in the space of all possible courses are, would humans win and would machines win?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to that.</p>
<p>I want to answer your other question, which is like, the DARPA challenge days, right?</p>
<p>What was really hard?</p>
<p>I think, I think we understand, we understood what we wanted to build, but still building</p>
<p>things, that experimentation, that iterated learning, that takes up a lot of time actually.</p>
<p>And so in my group, for example, in order for us to be able to develop fast, we build</p>
<p>like VR environments, we&rsquo;ll take an aircraft, we&rsquo;ll put it in a motion capture room, big,</p>
<p>huge motion capture room, and we&rsquo;ll fly it in real time, we&rsquo;ll render other images and</p>
<p>beam it back to the drone.</p>
<p>That sounds kind of notionally simple, but it&rsquo;s actually hard because now you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to fit all that data through the air into the drone.</p>
<p>And so you need to do a few crazy things to make that happen.</p>
<p>But once you do that, then at least you can try things.</p>
<p>If you crash into something, you didn&rsquo;t actually crash.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the whole drone is in VR.</p>
<p>We can do augmented reality and so on.</p>
<p>And so I think at some point testing becomes very important.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about Alpha Pilot is that they built the drone and they build a</p>
<p>lot of drones and it&rsquo;s okay to crash.</p>
<p>In fact, I think maybe the viewers may kind of like to see things that crash.</p>
<p>That potentially could be the most exciting part.</p>
<p>It could be the exciting part.</p>
<p>And I think as an engineer, it&rsquo;s a very different situation to be in.</p>
<p>Like in academia, a lot of my colleagues who are actually in this race and they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>great researchers, but I&rsquo;ve seen them trying to do similar things whereby they built this</p>
<p>one drone and somebody with like a face mask and a gloves are going right behind the drone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to hold it.</p>
<p>If it falls down, imagine you don&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the nice things about Alpha Pilot Challenge where we have these</p>
<p>drones and we&rsquo;re going to design the courses in a way that we&rsquo;ll keep pushing people up</p>
<p>until the crashes start to happen.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll hopefully sort of, I don&rsquo;t think you want to tell people crashing is okay.</p>
<p>Like we want to be careful here, but because we don&rsquo;t want people to crash a lot, but certainly</p>
<p>we want them to push it so that everybody crashes once or twice and they&rsquo;re really pushing</p>
<p>it to their limits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where iterated learning comes in, because every crash is a lesson.</p>
<p>Is a lesson.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So in terms of the space of possible courses, how do you think about it in the war of humans</p>
<p>versus machines, where do machines win?</p>
<p>We look at that quite a bit.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that you will see quickly that you can design a course and in certain</p>
<p>courses like in the middle somewhere, if you kind of run through the course once, the machine</p>
<p>gets beaten pretty much consistently by slightly.</p>
<p>But if you go through the course like 10 times, humans get beaten very slightly, but consistently.</p>
<p>So humans at some point, you get confused, you get tired and things like that versus</p>
<p>this machine is just executing the same line of code tirelessly, just going back to the</p>
<p>beginning and doing the same thing exactly.</p>
<p>I think that kind of thing happens and I realized sort of as humans, there&rsquo;s the classical things</p>
<p>that everybody has realized.</p>
<p>Like if you put in some sort of like strategic thinking, that&rsquo;s a little bit harder for machines</p>
<p>that I think sort of comprehend.</p>
<p>Machine is easy to do, so that&rsquo;s what they excel in.</p>
<p>And also sort of repeatability is easy to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they excel in.</p>
<p>You can build machines that excel in strategy as well and beat humans that way too, but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot harder to build.</p>
<p>I have a million more questions, but in the interest of time, last question.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful idea you&rsquo;ve come across in robotics?</p>
<p>Is it a simple equation, experiment, a demo, a simulation, a piece of software?</p>
<p>What just gives you pause?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I have done a lot of work myself in decision making, so I&rsquo;ve been interested in that area.</p>
<p>So you know, in robotics, somehow the field has split into like, you know, there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>who would work on like perception, how robots perceive the environment, then how do you</p>
<p>actually make like decisions and there&rsquo;s people also like how do you interact, people interact</p>
<p>with robots, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of different fields.</p>
<p>And you know, I have admittedly worked a lot on the more control and decision making than</p>
<p>the others.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, the one equation that has always kind of baffled me is Bellman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>equation.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this person who have realized like way back, you know, more than half a</p>
<p>century ago on like, how do you actually sit down?</p>
<p>And if you have several variables that you&rsquo;re kind of jointly trying to determine, how do</p>
<p>you determine that?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one beautiful equation that, you know, like today people do reinforcement</p>
<p>and we still use it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s baffling to me because it both kind of tells you the simplicity, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a single equation that anyone can write down.</p>
<p>You can teach it in the first course on decision making.</p>
<p>At the same time, it tells you how computationally, how hard the problem is.</p>
<p>I feel like my, like a lot of the things that I&rsquo;ve done at MIT for research has been kind</p>
<p>of just this fight against computational efficiency things.</p>
<p>Like how can we get it faster to the point where we now got to like, let&rsquo;s just redesign</p>
<p>this chip.</p>
<p>Like maybe that&rsquo;s the way, but I think it talks about how computationally hard certain</p>
<p>problems can be by nowadays what people call curse of dimensionality.</p>
<p>And so as the number of variables kind of grow, the number of decisions you can make</p>
<p>grows rapidly.</p>
<p>Like if you have, you know, a hundred variables, each one of them take 10 values, all possible</p>
<p>assignments is more than the number of atoms in the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>And that kind of thinking is just embodied in that one equation that I really like.</p>
<p>And the beautiful balance between it being theoretically optimal and somehow practically</p>
<p>speaking, given the curse of dimensionality, nevertheless in practice works among, you</p>
<p>know, despite all those challenges, which is quite incredible.</p>
<p>Which is quite incredible.</p>
<p>So, you know, I would say that it&rsquo;s kind of like quite baffling actually, you know, in</p>
<p>a lot of fields that we think about how little we know, you know, like, and so I think here</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>We know that in the worst case, things are pretty hard, but you know, in practice, generally</p>
<p>things work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just kind of, it&rsquo;s kind of baffling decision making, how little we know.</p>
<p>Just like how little we know about the beginning of time, how little we know about, you know,</p>
<p>our own future.</p>
<p>Like if you actually go into like from Bellman&rsquo;s equation all the way down, I mean, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also how little we know about like mathematics.</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t even know if the axioms are like consistent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>I think a good lesson there, just like as you said, we tend to focus on the worst case</p>
<p>or the boundaries of everything we&rsquo;re studying and then the average case seems to somehow</p>
<p>work out.</p>
<p>If you think about life in general, we mess it up a bunch.</p>
<p>You know, we freak out about a bunch of the traumatic stuff, but in the end it seems to</p>
<p>work out okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It seems like a good metaphor.</p>
<p>So Tashi, thank you so much for being a friend, a colleague, a mentor.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your advice.</p>
