<p>﻿[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another q a anything that I say is not</p>
<p>meant to diagnose or cure you check with</p>
<p>your doctor before implementing any of</p>
<p>the stuff that we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>with a great lineup of people to ask</p>
<p>questions and if you&rsquo;re on social media</p>
<p>definitely write your questions in we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to try to</p>
<p>today pull off a miracle and get to</p>
<p>every single person absolutely and we</p>
<p>have some highly intelligent people in</p>
<p>The Green Room ready to talk to us about</p>
<p>their various foilables or success</p>
<p>stories or whatever and also we have the</p>
<p>usual quiz questions and I must warn the</p>
<p>audience there are no true falsers which</p>
<p>should allow you to flip a coin and be</p>
<p>smart or dumb respectively in this case</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to use every</p>
<p>cognitive talent you have but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>interesting questions so we should all</p>
<p>know the answer to these and Doc here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first one</p>
<p>all right so first one is which sugar is</p>
<p>worse than high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>thanks for actually I could ask it even</p>
<p>better which one is more deadly</p>
<p>ouch so that&rsquo;s the first question okay</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll certainly want to know that one</p>
<p>okay why don&rsquo;t we also just kick it off</p>
<p>we love the fact that not only uh the</p>
<p>three folks that happen to be in the</p>
<p>United States that are going to come on</p>
<p>and ask you a question but also the</p>
<p>people all around the world so we&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to say a good morning to all of our</p>
<p>viewers joining us today from the UK</p>

<p>Belgium Ethiopia Norway Poland almost</p>
<p>done audience Ghana uh Peru Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>Finland and all across these United</p>
<p>States of America so welcome everyone</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t want to put the people in The</p>
<p>Green Room Under Pressure but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all looking for high entertainment from</p>
<p>all three of you so stand ready to be a</p>
<p>big part of the show all right speaking</p>
<p>of social media uh What uh let&rsquo;s start</p>
<p>off with social media one from Facebook</p>
<p>what are your recommendations to treat</p>
<p>vertigo</p>
<p>it can be a couple different causes to</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um one would be a sinus infection where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s mucus that builds up in the</p>
<p>eustachian tube and the back gets in the</p>
<p>back of the ear and so if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem it could be some</p>
<p>seasonal allergy and if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>Spanish black radish is the best uh</p>
<p>thing to take for that it tends to pull</p>
<p>mucus from the deep deep areas of your</p>
<p>body you can even get as a supplement</p>
<p>another uh problem with this is the</p>
<p>broken up little calcium deposits that</p>
<p>form uh in the inner ear and then they</p>
<p>can circulate around and irritate the</p>
<p>hairs of the ear and make it feel like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like always dizzy and things</p>
<p>like that</p>
<p>um and so in that case there&rsquo;s a the</p>
<p>video I did on a test that you can go</p>
<p>through to see if you have that and it</p>
<p>kind of helps you figure out which ear</p>
<p>that you have this problem with and one</p>
<p>of the good remedies for that is vitamin</p>
<p>K2</p>
<p>it helps to um kind of Transport</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know calcium in different places in</p>
<p>the body so that would be a good remedy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other remedies as well but</p>
<p>um and then there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>other things to look at as well but</p>
<p>those are the top two most common issues</p>
<p>okay very good in audience he mentioned</p>
<p>videos and here&rsquo;s another way to get</p>
<p>hold of them the free Dr Burr Gap app is</p>
<p>available on both uh</p>
<p>Android and Apple so grab hold of that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have all the information you</p>
<p>need in your pocket anytime you wish</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also very organized as I understand</p>
<p>right Dr Berg so if they query from</p>
<p>something there it&rsquo;s a lot easier to</p>
<p>find often than on YouTube</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a hard time finding my uh my</p>
<p>own videos on YouTube so uh yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a</p>
<p>search engine problem right now so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working on that all right very good okay</p>
<p>and as from YouTube is well confirmative</p>
<p>vegetables work the same as apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar with water</p>
<p>well I think they work a little</p>
<p>different because um when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>uh apple cider vinegar you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>acetic acid and when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>fermented vegetables you&rsquo;re doing more</p>
<p>lactic acid you can get lactic acid from</p>
<p>Kombucha tea and that has a different</p>
<p>effect than acetic acid but there are</p>
<p>two byproducts that your body actually</p>
<p>can make naturally as well so um</p>
<p>I think the benefit of the fermented</p>
<p>vegetables are huge because you get a</p>
<p>probiotic Prebiotic and you get um</p>
<p>you get the benefit of</p>
<p>um helping your immune system and</p>
<p>helping your gut Flora</p>
<p>um and then the acetic acid vinegar is</p>
<p>great for blood sugars it can give you</p>
<p>energy it can indirectly help you with</p>
<p>insulin resistance which is behind</p>
<p>so many problems out there including</p>
<p>fatty liver</p>
<p>wow okay well as usual there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>holdouts that want to be acknowledged</p>
<p>this morning and they are joining us</p>
<p>from Thailand Israel Dubai Japan Romania</p>
<p>and Morocco I can&rsquo;t imagine we&rsquo;ve missed</p>
<p>too many countries so that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>absolutely terrific all right on with</p>
<p>more from our social media folks Mystic</p>
<p>Melody from YouTube when you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>prolonged fast is it okay to drink broth</p>
<p>from boiled seasoned vegetables or will</p>
<p>it take you out of the autophagy</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not a bad idea if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing broth because you could that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good way to get your salts your sea salt</p>
<p>if you had a good amount of seed oil</p>
<p>salt in there and there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>calories in vegetable broth</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>I mean I think it&rsquo;s going to be totally</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um but when you get into more calorie</p>
<p>type foods that&rsquo;s when you break the</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>wow well Melody I thought he might yell</p>
<p>at you but he didn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s gonna let you</p>
<p>drink for a while yeah one more one more</p>
<p>point about the um they have the boy</p>
<p>what do you call those uh bullion cubes</p>
<p>yeah those little cubes that you buy to</p>
<p>as a stock for Soups and things read the</p>
<p>labels on those because they&rsquo;re filled</p>
<p>with monosodium glutamate</p>
<p>maltodextrin uh unfortunately it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to find one without that and</p>
<p>um hopefully someone will come up with</p>
<p>one without out that I will definitely</p>
<p>promote it and use it myself</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s give some counsel to</p>
<p>Kimberly from YouTube how much berberine</p>
<p>should I take on a daily basis I&rsquo;m 190</p>
<p>currently and five seven thank you she</p>
<p>says</p>
<p>I think you just take the normal dose</p>
<p>that they recommend because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>more is not always better with that herb</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll have a really cool effect of</p>
<p>helping you with insulin resistance I</p>
<p>just released the video today on</p>
<p>berberine and it&rsquo;s like a it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>natural version of metformin and people</p>
<p>are taking metformin for not just blood</p>
<p>sugar issues but for a lot of other</p>
<p>problems which have has a side effect</p>
<p>lactic acidosis so</p>
<p>um it also depletes your B1 vitamin as</p>
<p>well as B12 so you have to be careful</p>
<p>that but berberine doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>all right very good why don&rsquo;t we go to</p>
<p>our Green Room</p>
<p>uh speak of the devil look at this is</p>
<p>terrible poor marinade now she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look green normally but I just so you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something you can definitely</p>
<p>need to give her some counsel because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something going on but in</p>
<p>deference to you Marinette I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>take your picture down because it looks</p>
<p>funny and once you go ahead as a phone</p>
<p>call and ask Dr Berg your question</p>
<p>go ahead morning</p>
<p>oh my cushion</p>
<p>hello everybody</p>
<p>so my question was actually I started</p>
<p>based on your information Dr Burke I</p>
<p>started to do intermediate fasting</p>
<p>and um I love it so I would like to know</p>
<p>in order to have keto diet and</p>
<p>intermediate fasting how can that be</p>
<p>possible to build the muscle what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best way to build the muscle and what</p>
<p>type of nutrition uh in that case is</p>
<p>good to use supplements I meant</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of things you can try but like</p>
<p>creatine phosphate is a supplement your</p>
<p>body actually makes creatine</p>
<p>um and that does have an effect on</p>
<p>muscle</p>
<p>um and energy</p>
<p>um you can actually it gives you more</p>
<p>ATP so that&rsquo;s one thing you could try</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re doing weight training but</p>
<p>what stimulates the actual muscle growth</p>
<p>itself is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some exercise with with weights</p>
<p>resistant training versus anything else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re going to build muscle</p>
<p>now recently um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I switched my exercise routine</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to talk about that more on</p>
<p>some of the other questions so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to as I&rsquo;m talking about I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to say anything yet because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>realizing that&rsquo;s one of the questions</p>
<p>but the point is that um you need to</p>
<p>activate the muscle uh so while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting to build muscle because if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re just not active you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to build a muscle regardless</p>
<p>of how much protein you eat but building</p>
<p>muscle is not just eating more protein</p>
<p>you have to activate it with exercise</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest stimulus but this</p>
<p>creative phosphate can actually help you</p>
<p>a little bit with um it might</p>
<p>indirectly help muscle</p>
<p>um fibers but it does also increase</p>
<p>glycogen storage and with that comes</p>
<p>water so your muscles will look fuller</p>
<p>more hydrated it&rsquo;s not a bad thing</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;ll look bigger but we&rsquo;re I know</p>
<p>you want to probably make them actually</p>
<p>bigger so that can help as well</p>
<p>and how much milligram of creatine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for the year approximately if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not mistaken I think it&rsquo;s like three to</p>
<p>five grams</p>
<p>um per day help you in your workout</p>
<p>um to give you the unfair Advantage so</p>
<p>um yeah that&rsquo;s something you can add to</p>
<p>your your weight training</p>
<p>again all right Mary well listen my</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>all right thank you Mary yes thank you</p>
<p>okay get back with us and let us know if</p>
<p>you get all buff and stuff that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for and hoping for you all</p>
<p>right folks in the first quiz question</p>
<p>of the day was answered and it asked</p>
<p>bring that up which sugar is worse than</p>
<p>high fructose corn syrup and the</p>
<p>audience and I hope you&rsquo;re right at</p>
<p>least 80 percent of them say it is one</p>
<p>of the many artificial sweeteners such</p>
<p>as erythritol and then the last 20 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maltodextrin</p>
<p>what do you think God</p>
<p>Okay so</p>
<p>so this question is very specific to</p>
<p>just sugar</p>
<p>um but you&rsquo;re right maltodextrin acts</p>
<p>like a sugar even though it&rsquo;s developed</p>
<p>standby audience</p>
<p>do it while we&rsquo;re waiting for the doctor</p>
<p>to come back I&rsquo;m going to entertain you</p>
<p>once again to remind you all to get the</p>
<p>wonderful uh free download</p>
<p>and that will allow you to watch Dr Berg</p>
<p>even when he&rsquo;s Frozen on screen like he</p>
<p>appears to be currently so let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to just put us on pause for a</p>
<p>moment until we get the good doctor back</p>
<p>please stand by</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>Dr Berg I&rsquo;m sorry uh oh your audio is</p>
<p>not coming through yet audience again we</p>
<p>will work on this and get right back</p>
<p>with you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I tell you what folks</p>
<p>we mean Nate we may need to kind of</p>
<p>restart this software Dr Berg I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>sorry but I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to do so guest audience</p>
<p>everyone stand by and we&rsquo;ll be back with</p>
<p>standby we&rsquo;re coming back wait a minute</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see okay that&rsquo;s all right and</p>
<p>All Right audience forgive our terrible</p>
<p>glitch there but we&rsquo;re back with Dr Berg</p>
<p>and the cash I think we wrapped up that</p>
<p>one quiz question and now I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>answer I&rsquo;m going to answer the question</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t really get the</p>
<p>answer to the question so</p>
<p>um the worst sugar worse than high</p>
<p>fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>is you ready for this agave nectar I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna tell you why most sugars like beet</p>
<p>sugar like table sugar I purchase corn</p>
<p>syrup are roughly about a 50 50 split</p>
<p>between glucose and fructose</p>
<p>and fructose apparently does not</p>
<p>necessarily</p>
<p>work uh like glucose it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily spike your blood sugars or</p>
<p>affect insulin too much directly but</p>
<p>indirectly it does but directly it the</p>
<p>liver takes to load as compared to</p>
<p>glucose you know can be metabolized by</p>
<p>all of your cells so when you consume</p>
<p>um agave nectar you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with like 85 percent</p>
<p>fructose and only 15 percent glucose and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tremendous burden on the liver</p>
<p>because the liver treats glucose like</p>
<p>alcohol</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s considered a toxin so you say</p>
<p>well I thought God was natural yeah but</p>
<p>agave nectar is not natural</p>
<p>and so it puts a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>fructose into your body and you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all along the glycemic index but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just basically creating a fatty</p>
<p>liver and um probably eventually a scar</p>
<p>liver there&rsquo;s probably not going to be a</p>
<p>lot of research in this area but just</p>
<p>from the basic principle of</p>
<p>understanding fructose it&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>um that you could eat wow okay back to</p>
<p>surgery yeah yeah all right so uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to in this time Facebook Deborah</p>
<p>my aunt just told me she has end-stage</p>
<p>kidney failure is there any way keto and</p>
<p>or if could help her reverse this</p>
<p>um horrible disease please help if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in stage</p>
<p>um you have to really work with the docs</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s certain nutrients that</p>
<p>you have to be careful of having too</p>
<p>much like phosphate and potassium and</p>
<p>these other nutrients you have to work</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>a doc but on the same token I would</p>
<p>actually keep your carbs low and as the</p>
<p>kidney improves because think about the</p>
<p>number one cause of kidney damage it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>diabetes uh what&rsquo;s diabetes high sugar</p>
<p>in the diet and I&rsquo;m sorry in the in the</p>
<p>blood blood level so if you were to um</p>
<p>start improving that and then maybe go</p>
<p>from a end-stage liver disease to stage</p>
<p>four stage three and you start improving</p>
<p>the kidney function then maybe you can</p>
<p>add more of these um other things</p>
<p>nutrients that you your body can handle</p>
<p>so yeah you can do a version of the keto</p>
<p>but you just have to work with the dock</p>
<p>to make sure you&rsquo;re not taking too much</p>
<p>of certain nutrients but I if I had</p>
<p>end-stage kidney problem that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>exactly what I would do I would not um</p>
<p>you know do the diet that they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>recommending just the worst foods</p>
<p>possible wow well Deborah we&rsquo;re pulling</p>
<p>for your aunt I hope she can improve</p>
<p>from that um critical condition all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s go back to our questions and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the next one DOC for the audience</p>
<p>another no Truth All right so is</p>
<p>fructose lowering</p>
<p>if fructose is low low on the glycemic</p>
<p>index there&rsquo;s a typo there why is it so</p>
<p>bad for us</p>
<p>all right folks I may have just answered</p>
<p>that in the last question but let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>see how many people were listening well</p>
<p>who can blame them I got an excuse we</p>
<p>botched the show right in the middle so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see how loyal they are so get on</p>
<p>that folks uh and give us a nice answer</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go back to uh let&rsquo;s see social</p>
<p>media</p>
<p>okay we already did that one and Terry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>catching up with me hang on I&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>one for us</p>
<p>we did the berberine</p>
<p>okay Tracy from YouTube what advice</p>
<p>would you share with someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pregnant while on omad</p>
<p>I would probably add another meal in</p>
<p>there or two because you you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just always the factor of like are you</p>
<p>getting enough nutrients from the</p>
<p>calories are you getting enough energy</p>
<p>what you know it&rsquo;s not the best time to</p>
<p>do the omad one meal a day while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re feeding</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>for two so I think it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>important to eat healthy I would</p>
<p>definitely wouldn&rsquo;t do the snacking but</p>
<p>I would definitely probably have</p>
<p>probably three meals and uh and eat</p>
<p>super like</p>
<p>healthy version of Keto and that way</p>
<p>that child comes out uh has the best</p>
<p>chance of being super healthy now the</p>
<p>other factor I want to recommend is</p>
<p>definitely do breastfeeding because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find the immune system</p>
<p>and that child is going to be better</p>
<p>chances are of them having allergies are</p>
<p>going to be a lot smaller than if they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t breastfed so the most crucial</p>
<p>time is to make sure you have a natural</p>
<p>prenatal make sure you do super healthy</p>
<p>foods but so many women unfortunately</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that data and they um the</p>
<p>kids come out having more issues than</p>
<p>than not so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my advice all right very</p>
<p>good Dean from YouTube I have a cyst on</p>
<p>my kidney I have been eating only</p>
<p>organic foods it was first diagnosed</p>
<p>last August and have not been able to</p>
<p>gain weight since then help well Dean if</p>
<p>you need help gaining weight just come</p>
<p>to my house what do you think Don</p>
<p>the sister</p>
<p>um are a bit of an unknown you know</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t uh</p>
<p>really know what causes them so</p>
<p>either benign uh most of them don&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>or do anything they just sit there I</p>
<p>think I think the purpose of them is</p>
<p>just to encapsulate some type of</p>
<p>toxicity</p>
<p>and so the answer is to just go more</p>
<p>organic and eat less toxicity and go on</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet I don&rsquo;t I know that</p>
<p>cysts will grow on the body especially</p>
<p>like Baker cysts or other cysts if the</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s doing a lot of carbs</p>
<p>um or drinking wine is it will do it as</p>
<p>well so what I would do</p>
<p>um is I would um just stick on keto and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the cysts are interfering</p>
<p>with your weight gain or weight loss</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um anything related to kidney you do</p>
<p>want to do healthy keto for sure all</p>
<p>right very good well the audience is</p>
<p>jumping on these questions faster our</p>
<p>last one acid fructose is lower on the</p>
<p>glycemic index why is it bad for you and</p>
<p>the audience oh well 100 of our</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s bad news for Tada</p>
<p>drum roll the liver</p>
<p>yeah so I I</p>
<p>of course gave you that answer from the</p>
<p>previous question so that that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>good thing that most people are</p>
<p>listening or actually everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>listening 100 but I want to say</p>
<p>something about fructose because the</p>
<p>fructose is dealt with the body</p>
<p>differently the liver takes it it uh you</p>
<p>know the amount of it&rsquo;s the quantity too</p>
<p>like think about what people are doing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re drinking their fructose</p>
<p>especially even high fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>and that fructose</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s so refined it doesn&rsquo;t have all</p>
<p>the antioxidants that fruit does so like</p>
<p>as a food you&rsquo;re just drinking pure</p>
<p>fructose it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>from The evolutionary point of view it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s meant to consume or deal with</p>
<p>seasonal type maybe honey or fruit but</p>
<p>back way back in the day we didn&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>that quantity</p>
<p>that we eat now right which is available</p>
<p>24 7 in the in the amount of it so uh it</p>
<p>has an interesting effect on the liver</p>
<p>to help uh</p>
<p>help you store fat quicker for the</p>
<p>winter months</p>
<p>uh even generate uric acid as an</p>
<p>antioxidant</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the the quantities are just killing</p>
<p>us right now it&rsquo;s like going to the</p>
<p>liver will make that liver very fatty so</p>
<p>the next time you go get the big gulp</p>
<p>the sodas just remember what I said</p>
<p>about that it&rsquo;s just a high fructose</p>
<p>corn syrup</p>
<p>probably stay away from that all right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard it audience JK from YouTube</p>
<p>can L-Arginine help with increasing</p>
<p>height I assume that JK is in his growth</p>
<p>years</p>
<p>can help what increases right I guess</p>
<p>make him grow taller</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know I think that um</p>
<p>you know it does increase growth hormone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the thing that&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>it for you um there&rsquo;s other things that</p>
<p>can increase growth hormone which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to talk about later in the show</p>
<p>after I we answer all the questions but</p>
<p>growth hormone um</p>
<p>you can if you&rsquo;re growing and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>past the age of 18 or 20</p>
<p>um a really interesting product that I</p>
<p>used in practice was something called</p>
<p>the two Trophy and PMG you can get it</p>
<p>from a company called Standard Process</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not affiliated with that company but</p>
<p>pituitrophin supports pituitary and I I</p>
<p>swear like when I would put children</p>
<p>that should be taller on that</p>
<p>um I noticed they started growing a lot</p>
<p>faster</p>
<p>not guaranteeing it but it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>to look at to try out</p>
<p>all right very good L from YouTube how</p>
<p>can I lower my ANC of 6.1 I eat very</p>
<p>well and exercise daily I do have a</p>
<p>family history of diabetes and by the</p>
<p>way doc from for my knowledge and the</p>
<p>audience I hear those numbers all the</p>
<p>time what&rsquo;s good what&rsquo;s a good ANC</p>
<p>number what&rsquo;s a baseline a A1c is</p>
<p>basically the amount of accumulated</p>
<p>glucose that&rsquo;s stuck to your blood cells</p>
<p>like the hemoglobin that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>uh one of the best indicators for um</p>
<p>to see if someone&rsquo;s cheating or not</p>
<p>because it gives you an average of blood</p>
<p>sugars for the whole three months</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re cheating on the weekends</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll come out average it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>higher so we want it below</p>
<p>5.7 but even lower than that but 5.7 is</p>
<p>kind of the borderline as you go higher</p>
<p>uh you become a pre-diabetic and then a</p>
<p>6.4 is an actual diabetic so and it just</p>
<p>tells you where the blood sugars are we</p>
<p>want the blood sugars below 100 like</p>
<p>like maybe 80 something like that but I</p>
<p>mean a lot of people have A1C like in</p>
<p>the force 4.5 things like that and that</p>
<p>means their blood sugars are like like</p>
<p>low 70s even 60s you might think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hypoglycemia but if you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>sugar your blood sugars will go low and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel fine because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>adding the sugar but here&rsquo;s the thing if</p>
<p>you are a diabetic or you have a</p>
<p>pre-diabetic</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ve pretty much lost 50 percent of</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>beta cells that those are the cells in</p>
<p>the pancreas that make insulin which</p>
<p>means you have less insulin to deal with</p>
<p>which means you have less ability to</p>
<p>push the blood sugars down so even</p>
<p>though you start the ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>you come off sugars it might take longer</p>
<p>for you to bring your sugars down</p>
<p>because of the fact you just don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the insulin like you did before what you</p>
<p>need to do is just add those other</p>
<p>things like the apple cider vinegar the</p>
<p>berberine be real strict and just give</p>
<p>it more time because it will happen if</p>
<p>you do it it might take weeks or months</p>
<p>but just hang in there add exercise as</p>
<p>well and eventually it&rsquo;ll all come down</p>
<p>come out in the wash but um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that that&rsquo;s really why your</p>
<p>blood sugars are</p>
<p>higher and it&rsquo;s hard to bring them down</p>
<p>and of course that relates to A1C</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re measuring an average of</p>
<p>blood sugars for the whole three months</p>
<p>all right L it sounds like you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>right path uh you know keep exercising</p>
<p>and eat very well maybe you need to</p>
<p>examine that uh and Dr Burke has a</p>
<p>million uh videos to help guide you in</p>
<p>that regard okay Anna from YouTube which</p>
<p>diet would be best for a young child</p>
<p>should they follow the healthy keto and</p>
<p>iaf diet at an early age I can</p>
<p>anticipate your answer</p>
<p>it really depends a definitely healthy</p>
<p>keto for sure but fasting it really you</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;re seven years old and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re watching this right now you</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t need to do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting but I will say</p>
<p>um if if kids would just have three</p>
<p>meals a day and not all the snacks that</p>
<p>would be a good thing because I think uh</p>
<p>even if we compare myself when I was a</p>
<p>kid and even Steve when you were a kid</p>
<p>you probably</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t snack as much as they do now</p>
<p>everything is snack snack snack bring</p>
<p>food everywhere you go it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all pushed by the snack industry in fact</p>
<p>this might be shocking Steve but there</p>
<p>if you go to the grocery store there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entire aisles of snacks</p>
<p>for sale did you know that well</p>
<p>um unfortunately I&rsquo;ve fallen victim to</p>
<p>that a few times even with my immense</p>
<p>discipline sometimes my feet Screech to</p>
<p>a halt in uh in such a spot</p>
<p>yeah so um do the three meals and then</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a child is uh 11 or 12 years</p>
<p>old and there&rsquo;s obesity well then maybe</p>
<p>just do two meals a day but make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sufficient calories</p>
<p>All Right audience stand by you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming in and out doc</p>
<p>here we go I think we&rsquo;ve got you back</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so we lost about the last five seconds</p>
<p>but anyway</p>
<p>um so you know doc you mentioned um</p>
<p>you know my youth and I&rsquo;m almost 70</p>
<p>years old so in the 60s you if you saw a</p>
<p>person overweight it was like a</p>
<p>spectacle now we didn&rsquo;t eat all that</p>
<p>well but maybe the exercise also makes a</p>
<p>difference you know we had a peanut</p>
<p>butter and jelly sandwich on Wonder</p>
<p>Bread for lunch but then we ran all day</p>
<p>long and fell around and maybe have a</p>
<p>Kool-Aid Ice Cube which is probably the</p>
<p>worst thing in the world filled with</p>
<p>sugar but no one was overweight so it</p>
<p>really is interesting we&rsquo;re you know all</p>
<p>stuck in front of an iPad and so on but</p>
<p>you know we used to run all day long and</p>
<p>we never saw anyone that was overweight</p>
<p>again it was sort of a spectacle if you</p>
<p>saw a big person walking around</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s three things the the</p>
<p>biggest change would be the fructose</p>
<p>introduction of fructose that&rsquo;s big in</p>
<p>the high fructose corn syrup also you</p>
<p>have the snacking is probably might be</p>
<p>even bigger more snacking we implemented</p>
<p>that I remember we didn&rsquo;t have that as</p>
<p>much and then um also then the Omega</p>
<p>six fatty acids the oils all the oils</p>
<p>have replaced the saturated fats which</p>
<p>is another Factor so I think those three</p>
<p>factors and like you said exercise is</p>
<p>another Factor but yeah those are big</p>
<p>changes</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all right very good well let&rsquo;s go boy</p>
<p>excuse me girl boy girl so we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to bring Aaron in next and Aaron is</p>
<p>joining us from Dallas Texas where he</p>
<p>says it&rsquo;s very humid and hot right now</p>
<p>and Aaron if you&rsquo;re unmuted you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi hey um</p>
<p>completely</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>yeah I think there is</p>
<p>um one of the biggest things you have to</p>
<p>realize also testosterone follows the</p>
<p>biochemistry of growth hormone they both</p>
<p>kind of work in a similar fashion uh the</p>
<p>top of the list is zinc make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking enough zinc and eating foods high</p>
<p>in zinc like shellfish especially</p>
<p>oysters are the best and even red meat</p>
<p>so the zinc will help you greatly and</p>
<p>then of course the um the intense</p>
<p>exercise is another thing that can help</p>
<p>you with that as well you have to be</p>
<p>careful about estrogen being too high in</p>
<p>men</p>
<p>um and believe it or not not that you</p>
<p>you do this but there&rsquo;s something called</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>alcohol wine and beer and things like</p>
<p>that that will increase your estrogen</p>
<p>and shut down the testosterone</p>
<p>um so to overcome this uh</p>
<p>aging related lower testosterone you</p>
<p>have exercise zinc</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s intense exercise and then</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>um the cold bath the cold immersion</p>
<p>believe it or not has some great</p>
<p>research on increasing testosterone as a</p>
<p>hermetic or a genetic stimulus in that</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s another thing jump in the cold</p>
<p>cold shower or bath that to to raise</p>
<p>that those levels I think and then</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>fasting is another thing that will</p>
<p>increase testosterone Believe It or Not</p>
<p>prolonged periodic prolonged and regular</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>all right thank you</p>
<p>hey you&rsquo;re welcome you know keep us</p>
<p>posted that&rsquo;s really fascinating uh</p>
<p>Aaron uh you know I&rsquo;ve heard lately that</p>
<p>men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s testosterone is a lot</p>
<p>lower than it used to be because of</p>
<p>things in the environment phthalates and</p>
<p>plastic and so on so who knows we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>going again a lot different than when we</p>
<p>were little kids hun doc</p>
<p>slightly yeah okay let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go to the question number three for</p>
<p>the day and Doc here it is</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m gonna pull this one up here</p>
<p>okay so what is the primary reason a</p>
<p>diabetic</p>
<p>uh has a problem lowering blood sugars</p>
<p>after getting off carbs now what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting is people are asking</p>
<p>questions that are kind of crossing over</p>
<p>to some of these questions so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s paying attention and see if they</p>
<p>can get that answer here we&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for 100 audience you had the tip okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see TV in Texas from YouTube what</p>
<p>would be the best substitute for</p>
<p>Adderall in a 55 year old with true ADHD</p>
<p>yeah I would highly recommend you know</p>
<p>in addition to the healthy keto and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the fasting to get on a natural</p>
<p>form of the B complex okay B complex</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll feed the neurons it&rsquo;ll feed the</p>
<p>brain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh don&rsquo;t use the synthetic and then use</p>
<p>higher amounts</p>
<p>um of this B1</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think that would be a great great</p>
<p>program and you&rsquo;d probably see</p>
<p>miraculous results for attention</p>
<p>uh to increase your focus and your</p>
<p>attention</p>
<p>um it might be a transition when you</p>
<p>phase off the medication but keep</p>
<p>working with your doctor to do that</p>
<p>um because the problem is every time you</p>
<p>do it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to come off of it your body</p>
<p>gets a little bit weakened and used to</p>
<p>it so it&rsquo;s going to be a time transition</p>
<p>phase you can&rsquo;t just do a cold turkey</p>
<p>but but work with your doc to do that</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>hopefully you can come off that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you know even some of the psych</p>
<p>drugs</p>
<p>um they put you on this but is there any</p>
<p>a plan is there a plan to come off of it</p>
<p>and how do you come off of it and what</p>
<p>do you replace it is there any I mean</p>
<p>some docs don&rsquo;t even think you&rsquo;re ever</p>
<p>going to come off of it like is this a</p>
<p>permanent thing and there&rsquo;s side effects</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s complications and also the</p>
<p>more you use it the more it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>so you need more amounts of it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>not a long-term solution or if even if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a short one</p>
<p>well speaking of testosterone Marta from</p>
<p>YouTube what would you recommend besides</p>
<p>ifn if for a 41 year old woman with high</p>
<p>testosterone levels I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>post-menopausal that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um testosterone is a form of androgens</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a couple things that can</p>
<p>increase Androgen too in an unhealthy</p>
<p>way for women and the biggest one is um</p>
<p>insulin so there could be something</p>
<p>increasing the insulin so you want to go</p>
<p>on low low carb do intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also another remedy for high</p>
<p>energies in women that have polycystic</p>
<p>ovarian syndrome which is inositol</p>
<p>inositol is a really good remedy to help</p>
<p>regulate that and it just happens to be</p>
<p>kind of a it&rsquo;s a type of B vitamin that</p>
<p>is even sweet it&rsquo;s like when you you can</p>
<p>suck on it it&rsquo;s like eating candy but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no sugar in it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting all right very good well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very relieved to hear from spam Mouse</p>
<p>from YouTube who has the theory that Dr</p>
<p>Berg&rsquo;s goats are eating his internet</p>
<p>connection and I appreciate that spam</p>
<p>Mouse because that takes the pressure</p>
<p>off of me certainly it can&rsquo;t be my</p>
<p>production set up here so Dr Berg</p>
<p>everyone forgives you and your goats for</p>
<p>botching up the um the feed earlier and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely absorbed I will say I</p>
<p>will say something about goats out of</p>
<p>all the animals different animals we</p>
<p>have oh those goats I swear they</p>
<p>it could be a sitcom they can get in</p>
<p>they have personalities they get into</p>
<p>everything no matter what you do you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t conceal them in a paddock they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find a way to get out no matter what and</p>
<p>uh I keep building bigger barriers and</p>
<p>to the point where they somehow got</p>
<p>through it so now how about your Pat to</p>
<p>go we haven&rsquo;t heard from him in about a</p>
<p>year Billy is it where&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s Billy</p>
<p>doing yes Billy Billy is one of the</p>
<p>goats uh that Karen bottle fed</p>
<p>um and and he&rsquo;s the kind of the leader</p>
<p>of the pack so uh</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re uh they&rsquo;re an interesting</p>
<p>Clan</p>
<p>all right very good well again thanks</p>
<p>for saving me on that spam Mouse really</p>
<p>appreciate it let&rsquo;s see Linda from</p>
<p>YouTube I have recurring mono and I seem</p>
<p>to catch coals and virus very easily how</p>
<p>can I boost my immune system I feel</p>
<p>myself getting more tired and weak over</p>
<p>time sorry to hear that Linda</p>
<p>yeah the mono is a</p>
<p>usually the epstein-bar virus they can</p>
<p>go it&rsquo;s a light embarrassing go in and</p>
<p>out of remission</p>
<p>um mainly triggered by stress emotional</p>
<p>stress so that is something you have to</p>
<p>hyper focus on and do whatever you can</p>
<p>to improve that stress and do things to</p>
<p>release the stress including physical</p>
<p>work around the house long walks</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I have a lot of videos on that</p>
<p>but um you can also take things like</p>
<p>zinc and vitamin D but it&rsquo;s usually some</p>
<p>type of uh stressful stress situation</p>
<p>that activates or brings it out of</p>
<p>remission</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the area that I</p>
<p>would put your attention on</p>
<p>all right very good okay Asian calling</p>
<p>themselves that Asian from YouTube is</p>
<p>the high fat keto diet acceptable for</p>
<p>someone with no gallbladder there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>few of those</p>
<p>yeah yeah because guess what your body</p>
<p>still makes uh bile it&rsquo;s just not stored</p>
<p>and concentrated so some people are do</p>
<p>just quite fine but let&rsquo;s say your stool</p>
<p>uh becomes light colored or it starts to</p>
<p>float or you notice your eyes at night</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re driving you can&rsquo;t quite see as</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a lack of vitamin A means</p>
<p>you need more biles so just add a little</p>
<p>bile salts after the meal</p>
<p>and that will solve that problem but um</p>
<p>if you have too much bile you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>diarrhea so that&rsquo;s another way to know</p>
<p>you have too much</p>
<p>so all right very good well the audience</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t answer this with a hundred</p>
<p>percent and the question asked what is</p>
<p>the primary reason a diabetic has a</p>
<p>problem lowering blood sugars after</p>
<p>getting off of carbs and let&rsquo;s see the</p>
<p>split in the audience 65 percent of the</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s because it takes</p>
<p>time for the insulin to be restored to a</p>
<p>normal level 20 say it&rsquo;s because all of</p>
<p>the stored sugars in the body like</p>
<p>glycogen and 15 there&rsquo;s less insulin in</p>
<p>the pancreas to for to process the</p>
<p>sugars three answers</p>
<p>well you know most people got it right</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like I said before you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only producing you only have like 50 of</p>
<p>the beta cells that make insulin so now</p>
<p>the because the pancreas is damaged So</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re not you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough insulin anymore and on top of</p>
<p>that you have insulin resistance so</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s been working so hard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exhausted so now we don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>that push down blood sugar push down uh</p>
<p>Force anymore like we did before and so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re diabetic it takes longer to</p>
<p>reestablish these blood sugars the thing</p>
<p>to do is know that don&rsquo;t give up and</p>
<p>give it more time</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um more fasting will help you and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see It&rsquo;ll eventually over the course of</p>
<p>weeks or months it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll come down</p>
<p>all right very good well before the</p>
<p>goats get to the wire again we should</p>
<p>get Georgina on and she&rsquo;s from Baton</p>
<p>Rouge and Gina you are on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>with your one question in 30 seconds go</p>
<p>all right hi Dr Berg I have been on your</p>
<p>plan since February</p>
<p>um doing great resolved many issues so</p>
<p>far but there is one that no one seems</p>
<p>to be able to help me with</p>
<p>um I have suffered from lifelong</p>
<p>hormonal migraines that come around the</p>
<p>time of my cycle</p>
<p>accompanied with extreme hunger and</p>
<p>nothing seems to help I&rsquo;ve tried the</p>
<p>sodium like you recommended</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>a speeding train I can&rsquo;t stop it</p>
<p>um I want I don&rsquo;t want to rely on the</p>
<p>pharmaceutical medications anymore do</p>
<p>you have any suggestions</p>
<p>did you say it&rsquo;s related to your cycle</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s a week before or the day of and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it comes in threes so I have three</p>
<p>days of full-blown migraines there&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>um I can&rsquo;t seem to fix that issue I I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>suffered with the hypoglycemia with the</p>
<p>hunger headaches and the keto has helped</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>and I thought it would help with this</p>
<p>hormonal issue but I can&rsquo;t seem to stop</p>
<p>it like for example I woke up with one</p>
<p>at four o&rsquo;clock this morning today I had</p>
<p>to take a pill</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not hungry I&rsquo;m fasting 23 hours</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>except when my Cycle&rsquo;s coming I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stop the Hunger</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrible I could only imagine it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>very irritating there&rsquo;s a couple tips uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>um related to a shift in estrogen what</p>
<p>estrogen does there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>that I would try right off the bat um I</p>
<p>have there&rsquo;s been some success with</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>turmeric like uh maybe a couple days</p>
<p>before your period and really getting</p>
<p>that turmeric in the body it says some</p>
<p>cool properties to help</p>
<p>hormonal flows the other remedy would be</p>
<p>milk thistle for your liver</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a hormone</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a Was A protein that helps you</p>
<p>buffer</p>
<p>uh fluctuations in estrogen and you</p>
<p>might you might need that help and milk</p>
<p>thistle is one of the best</p>
<p>protective herbs against</p>
<p>so many things in the liver so it</p>
<p>basically protects liver against poisons</p>
<p>and uh it also helps with estrogen and</p>
<p>of course</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m guessing you already tried dim</p>
<p>which is a concentrated cruciferous</p>
<p>which actually helps regulate estrogen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another factor that I would look</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make a mental note because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s I have started some I&rsquo;ve saw</p>
<p>some research on this not too long ago</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll have to do a video on</p>
<p>um hormonal headaches because I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>done one on that I think that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good Deep dive that I&rsquo;ll have to further</p>
<p>investigate to solve that mystery</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>could be devastating so</p>
<p>especially if you probably have to take</p>
<p>medication well I think the two remedies</p>
<p>that I recommended should probably even</p>
<p>help you just with repairing the liver</p>
<p>from the medication one thing that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>also have attention on that um might</p>
<p>also help you</p>
<p>during the headache is to take that</p>
<p>tadka because what it can do for just</p>
<p>the flow of things through the liver and</p>
<p>maybe take higher amounts right when you</p>
<p>start to get the headache and see if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t resolve it so tatka is another</p>
<p>thing to put on the list</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>thank you very much you&rsquo;re welcome good</p>
<p>luck with that there&rsquo;s I understand</p>
<p>migraines are no fun and I feel very</p>
<p>blessed that that&rsquo;s never been one of my</p>
<p>issues so</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you</p>
<p>Georgina I wonder if it&rsquo;s all the fungus</p>
<p>in Baton Rouge I was teasing her that is</p>
<p>so sticky and hot down there I mean my</p>
<p>gosh</p>
<p>um yeah if it was this fungus she would</p>
<p>have it all the time she would have it</p>
<p>not during the cycle exactly well I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>quit playing doctor here anyway good</p>
<p>luck with that Georgina and let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>our next to the last question Doc and</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>which epigenetic factor is better to</p>
<p>help you burn more fat</p>
<p>cold therapy or heat therapy interesting</p>
<p>All Right audience jump on that and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to Jasmine from YouTube what</p>
<p>can I do to treat my sibo I have been</p>
<p>using your gallbladder formula as well</p>
<p>as vitamin D and your electrolyte and</p>
<p>cruciferous supplements what else can</p>
<p>Jasmine do</p>
<p>siebel is small intestinal bacterial</p>
<p>overgrowth it&rsquo;s a situation where you</p>
<p>have bacteria in the wrong place it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the small intestine it should be in the</p>
<p>large and uh and I think if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken you said you taking betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride because you need that for</p>
<p>sure and a lot of it to really keep that</p>
<p>stomach acid you&rsquo;re taking the bile</p>
<p>which is good because that&rsquo;ll flush out</p>
<p>some of the bacteria too but the next</p>
<p>probably most important thing is to do a</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting more fasting</p>
<p>to allow things to kind of go through</p>
<p>um the problem is every time you eat</p>
<p>anything especially fiber it&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>end up fermenting at the wrong place and</p>
<p>you feel really bloated and those darn</p>
<p>microbes will start stealing and robbing</p>
<p>your nutrition so you probably would</p>
<p>benefit going on Carnivore for one or</p>
<p>two months that way you give these</p>
<p>microbes no fiber no more fiber to</p>
<p>ferment and your digestion will be much</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>all right very good mumac from YouTube</p>
<p>is it possible that you can produce</p>
<p>electrolytes without calcium if that</p>
<p>makes sense</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>I understand why</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in my electrolyte powder</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t not want to put any even though</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never recommend taking calcium</p>
<p>supplements so I put really really tiny</p>
<p>amounts right if you look at the amounts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very small compared to</p>
<p>what the rdas are at least which I think</p>
<p>are way over the top of like if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken it could be like 750 to a</p>
<p>thousand milligrams so we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>talking about a few milligrams so</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re taking all these</p>
<p>electrolytes</p>
<p>in a group or in a complex that little</p>
<p>bit of calcium</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be a factor but I do</p>
<p>understand the request uh we probably</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t take it completely out but I can</p>
<p>look at it again just to reevaluate</p>
<p>all right well audience must be</p>
<p>listening because believe it or not the</p>
<p>question which just was asked which</p>
<p>epigenetic factor is better at helping</p>
<p>you burn more fat cold or heat therapy</p>
<p>in the audience as Terry designate says</p>
<p>Burr cold therapy what do you think Don</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t stimulate any</p>
<p>brown fat you don&rsquo;t increase your</p>
<p>metabolism because of that</p>
<p>when you do heat therapy it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be the cold therapy so the cold therapy</p>
<p>has a very specific additional benefit</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re kind of cross over they</p>
<p>do a lot of similar things is with</p>
<p>recovery and brain Improvement between</p>
<p>those two therapies but that cold it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more uncomfortable it it can actually</p>
<p>help you lose a good amount of weight so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really cool Factor kind of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you think about what a calorie is has to</p>
<p>do with heat right releasing heat</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re releasing a lot of heat when you</p>
<p>do the cold therapy and so it&rsquo;s a good I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a great thing for weight loss</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also good for brain health and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really uncomfortable so you know it</p>
<p>must be good for you right Steve oh my</p>
<p>gosh well you told me five seconds at</p>
<p>first can you clue Us in the audience as</p>
<p>to how you&rsquo;re doing with your coal</p>
<p>plunge oh yeah uh I I I brought I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do the 37 degrees uh Fahrenheit I had to</p>
<p>go up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at 10 degrees Celsius and I can</p>
<p>do that now for about five minutes wow</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s definitely getting better it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting easier it&rsquo;s like the first</p>
<p>minute and a half all of a sudden and</p>
<p>then everything goes numb after that and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like okay I can do this all</p>
<p>day I&rsquo;ll be done it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I like it it&rsquo;s a really good therapy</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s exciting all right doc one</p>
<p>question left and these have been some</p>
<p>great questions today and here it is</p>
<p>okay out of all the types of exercise</p>
<p>which specific type</p>
<p>spikes growth hormone the most and this</p>
<p>would also relate to the testosterone oh</p>
<p>interesting All Right audience you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done so well today uh carry on with that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see oh Sylvia door from YouTube</p>
<p>can you please do a live stream with</p>
<p>your goats so um oh yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely doable yeah I can bring them</p>
<p>in the house and you can see them for</p>
<p>sure well I tell you what Billy was just</p>
<p>so adorable Mike and last time we saw</p>
<p>Billy he was just barely a handful or</p>
<p>about the size of a cat I&rsquo;m sure is</p>
<p>Billy grown now is he a big guy no no he</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really grown too much more but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a dwarf uh goat but they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really complement the other animals</p>
<p>because they eat all the weeds</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t eat as much grass they like</p>
<p>the weeds and they&rsquo;ll eat these pricker</p>
<p>bushes and I&rsquo;m just amazed that they</p>
<p>they uh they will eat all those things</p>
<p>uh so they&rsquo;re very fascinating creatures</p>
<p>wow okay and from YouTube after doing</p>
<p>keto and if for a while</p>
<p>uh not in the best way I now have been</p>
<p>diagnosed with anemia isn&rsquo;t it is it</p>
<p>possible to do fasting ever again if</p>
<p>that makes sense doc</p>
<p>well I think um is it an iron anemia or</p>
<p>a B12 Anemia if you&rsquo;re doing the keto</p>
<p>that I recommend you&rsquo;re doing uh red</p>
<p>meat and you&rsquo;re doing you know fish and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing um</p>
<p>things that have B12 and iron that</p>
<p>should be good but the other factor is</p>
<p>that you need a good strong acid stomach</p>
<p>so that betaine hydrochloride might help</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um and then let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that you still have anemia</p>
<p>maybe you need to take a supplement like</p>
<p>a concentrated um</p>
<p>spleen extract would be a really good</p>
<p>one for anemia because maybe you uh</p>
<p>menstruate I don&rsquo;t know so these are</p>
<p>just things to look at to see how you</p>
<p>can counter it</p>
<p>okay this is interesting black from</p>
<p>YouTube I&rsquo;m 17 and I&rsquo;m having a conster</p>
<p>a constant hunger feeling under my chest</p>
<p>and near my stomach this has been going</p>
<p>on for a year what&rsquo;s going on uh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>well uh the biggest indicator to know</p>
<p>that keto is working and you&rsquo;re burning</p>
<p>fat is your hunger goes away so I can</p>
<p>guarantee you that this person is not</p>
<p>doing the low carb am I doing the higher</p>
<p>carb or the frequent meals which will</p>
<p>make them hungry all the time and not be</p>
<p>able to go from one meal to the next</p>
<p>without being ravenously hungry so you</p>
<p>need to add more fat and do less carbs</p>
<p>and you will find that your hunger goes</p>
<p>away</p>
<p>very good the very best audience in the</p>
<p>world has whipped through the last</p>
<p>question which asked out of all types of</p>
<p>exercise which specific type of exercise</p>
<p>spikes the wonderful growth hormone the</p>
<p>most sixty percent say it&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>intensity exercise 20 say it&rsquo;s aerobic</p>
<p>exercise and 10 say it&rsquo;s weight lifting</p>
<p>and 10 say it&rsquo;s walking</p>
<p>so so the high intensity and weight</p>
<p>training and is correct but specifically</p>
<p>sprinting</p>
<p>sprinting is the one I was looking for</p>
<p>sprinting does if you do it right you</p>
<p>actually work the whole body</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the highest intensity type of</p>
<p>workout because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re using the</p>
<p>whole body for this flat out Sprint For</p>
<p>What 10 seconds so</p>
<p>um as I was revisiting this I&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>this is this is quite a workout this is</p>
<p>a short workout too so uh Steve I think</p>
<p>you would agree anyone can at least</p>
<p>spend 10 seconds working out right I</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s not much to ask for a person</p>
<p>you can actually hold your breath and do</p>
<p>a Sprint for 10 seconds but um</p>
<p>undoing the sprinting uphills now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually easier on my knees</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>um but the sprinting combined with the</p>
<p>cold therapy and the heat therapy with</p>
<p>fasting and keto is what I&rsquo;m doing right</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m doing I&rsquo;m doing a</p>
<p>video on that but um if the key with</p>
<p>sprinting is to make sure you know of</p>
<p>course</p>
<p>do it at your own you know level don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>overdo it if you have a bad joint or a</p>
<p>knee problem but</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a great great uh exercise and</p>
<p>you would just do 10 seconds and then</p>
<p>you would wait for a while maybe just go</p>
<p>back to what you&rsquo;re doing and then do</p>
<p>like seven of those a day</p>
<p>does flat out Sprints and uh Watch What</p>
<p>Happens you&rsquo;ll start feeling really</p>
<p>really good and it helps um on many</p>
<p>different levels because you have to</p>
<p>this massive explosion of all your</p>
<p>muscles have to be coordinated and you</p>
<p>know you want to wear flatter shoes you</p>
<p>want to um if you can run in the grass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s the exercise that can</p>
<p>greatly help you reverse that aging</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>all right very good this is probably our</p>
<p>final deal for the day and j7 Pro from</p>
<p>YouTube is iodine okay for someone with</p>
<p>hypothyroid hypothyroid say that for me</p>
<p>especially especially it&rsquo;s for someone</p>
<p>with hypothyroidism because you need to</p>
<p>build up those uh thyroid</p>
<p>um hormones with iodine as a precursor</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget selenium that&rsquo;s for the</p>
<p>conversion of T4 to T3 so like c-calp</p>
<p>has both and has zinc too so um yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh you don&rsquo;t want to take iodine</p>
<p>if you have hyperthyroid but hypo is is</p>
<p>what you want to do all right very good</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;ve got a new sort of thing here</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to bring in a little Bumper</p>
<p>Music to remind the audience and you</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re ready to go out for the week</p>
<p>well thank you thank you so much for all</p>
<p>your attention and your patience and uh</p>
<p>tolerating the glitch in the system that</p>
<p>Steve promises he will completely and</p>
<p>utterly fix next time absolutely</p>
<p>um but I appreciate your attention stay</p>
<p>tuned for more videos and have a</p>
<p>wonderful weekend</p>
<p>foreign</p>
