    <p>Our card this week is Rachel Runyon, the five of clubs from Utah.</p>
<p>In the early 80s, a small town&rsquo;s illusion of safety was shattered when one of its youngest</p>
<p>residents was kidnapped just steps away from her backyard.</p>
<p>And her abduction, along with some strange happenings that unfolded after, has haunted</p>
<p>the residents of Sunset, Utah for the last 40 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was lunchtime on Thursday, August 26, 1982.</p>
<p>Elaine Runyon had just finished cooking sloppy joes for her three young children.</p>
<p>Their yard had a gate with direct access to a playground, and for the first time ever,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d let them go by themselves while she cooked.</p>
<p>I mean, she could see almost the whole thing from her window, so now that the food was</p>
<p>ready, she called out that very window, letting them know that it was time for them to come</p>
<p>in for lunch.</p>
<p>That was the deal they&rsquo;d made.</p>
<p>You can go to the playground, but you have to come home as soon as I call for lunch.</p>
<p>So when she called their names, she expected to see her three kids running to the house.</p>
<p>Five-year-old Justin, three-year-old Rachel, and one-and-a-half-year-old Nathan.</p>
<p>But there were no kids running toward the house when she called, so she stepped outside</p>
<p>to see where they were.</p>
<p>To her surprise, they were much farther away than they were supposed to be.</p>
<p>They were all the way across the big field next to the playground.</p>
<p>Elaine shouted again for the three to come eat lunch, and this time they heard her.</p>
<p>But as they were running back to the house, Elaine noticed it was only Justin and Nathan</p>
<p>responding to her shouts.</p>
<p>Elaine vividly remembers that day and that very moment, because that was when her life</p>
<p>changed forever.</p>
<p>When her two sons made it back to their yard, Justin&rsquo;s eyes were wide with fear.</p>
<p>He goes, Mommy, I have some real bad news.</p>
<p>And he never said those words in his life, like, he was just quiet, and he just, he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talk like that.</p>
<p>So it was strange to hear that being said.</p>
<p>Justin told his mom that Rachel was in a blue car with a man they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Before racing, Elaine dropped to her knees to be face-to-face with the five-year-old</p>
<p>Justin.</p>
<p>Elaine pressed her son for more information, and Justin said all three of them were playing</p>
<p>at the playground, building sandcastles, when a man approached them and asked if they wanted</p>
<p>to go get ice cream at Bobco&rsquo;s, which is a local store.</p>
<p>Justin said, Rachel goes, I like bubblegum.</p>
<p>He goes, well, I&rsquo;ve got some in my car.</p>
<p>Follow me.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t grab her at that point.</p>
<p>He started walking, and so then she&rsquo;s following, and then Justin&rsquo;s following her, and then</p>
<p>Nathan&rsquo;s behind her.</p>
<p>As they followed the man to his car, they were getting farther and farther from the</p>
<p>playground and their backyard, and Justin started to get a bad feeling.</p>
<p>And moments later, his fear was realized when the man did something unexpected.</p>
<p>He turned around, and he grabbed Rachel and put her over his shoulder, and he said to</p>
<p>the boys, we&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, that doesn&rsquo;t sound right, you know?</p>
<p>And by now she&rsquo;s screaming.</p>
<p>And the guy put her in the car, and she was having her hands on the window screaming.</p>
<p>She did not want to go.</p>
<p>By now, Elaine was in a complete panic.</p>
<p>She rushed into the house and frantically called her husband, Jeff, who was at work.</p>
<p>She told him that Rachel had been kidnapped.</p>
<p>Jeff told her to call the police while he made his way back home.</p>
<p>Once Elaine called 911, officers were on the scene within minutes, swarming her living</p>
<p>room and backyard.</p>
<p>Elaine grabbed a picture of Rachel off the fridge and handed it to police, a visual guide</p>
<p>to help them find the little girl with curly blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>Elaine also described to police what her daughter was wearing when she was taken.</p>
<p>An outfit she&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>
<p>It was a little sundress with matching bloomers.</p>
<p>She had tennis shoes and yellow smiley shoelaces.</p>
<p>And the floral pattern was like little green and white and flowers.</p>
<p>It was blue trim right here.</p>
<p>The police department in Sunset, Utah was small, but several officers were there and</p>
<p>ready to help find Rachel.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was try and get a description of the man and his car from</p>
<p>five-year-old Justin.</p>
<p>They also tracked down a 10-year-old boy who said he&rsquo;d been at the playground and saw</p>
<p>the man and his car as well.</p>
<p>Both young boys described him as a tall black man, maybe 30 to 35, with a mustache driving</p>
<p>a blue Ford Pinto with woodgrain paneling down the sides.</p>
<p>Within 20 minutes, police had blocked roads in the area and were screening cars.</p>
<p>Officers were hopeful they&rsquo;d find her.</p>
<p>It had only been about a half hour since Rachel was taken, and they were quick to take action</p>
<p>and were pulling out all the stops to get her back.</p>
<p>While police were out looking for Rachel, Elaine was conducting her own search.</p>
<p>She rushed to Bobco&rsquo;s, the store that the man had said he would take the kids to for</p>
<p>ice cream, hoping that maybe by some stroke of luck the man had actually taken Rachel</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>The panicked mom asked employees if they&rsquo;d seen a little girl with the man, but no one</p>
<p>had.</p>
<p>Police were also hitting a wall.</p>
<p>The minutes had turned to hours, and there was no sign of Rachel, her kidnapper, or the</p>
<p>blue car.</p>
<p>It was late that night when police accepted the fact that the kidnapper had somehow gotten</p>
<p>out of town before the roadblocks were in place, so they made plans to launch a full-scale</p>
<p>investigation the next morning.</p>
<p>Jeff and Elaine Runyon knew that they should try to go to sleep that night, but they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stop thinking about all the horrible things that man might be doing to their daughter.</p>
<p>The first thing officers did the next morning was to have a sketch artist work with Justin</p>
<p>and the 10-year-old witness to create a composite sketch of the kidnapper.</p>
<p>You can actually see that sketch on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And while police worked, Elaine and Jeff were doing anything they could think of to bring</p>
<p>their daughter home.</p>
<p>They held fundraisers to raise the reward for Rachel&rsquo;s return, they hung up flyers,</p>
<p>and the Sunset community really rallied around them.</p>
<p>A local grocery store printed thousands and thousands of flyers for the Runyons to distribute,</p>
<p>and a nearby KFC even put pictures of Rachel on their buckets of chicken.</p>
<p>Everybody was trying so hard to think of what they could do to help, to make it better,</p>
<p>to bring her home.</p>
<p>As Rachel&rsquo;s abduction started to hit the news in northern Utah, the city of Sunset</p>
<p>announced that it would offer a $20,000 reward for Rachel&rsquo;s safe return, and the money</p>
<p>the Runyons raised was enough to double it.</p>
<p>At the time, the Sunset Police Department was a seven-person agency, so even with officers'</p>
<p>best efforts, their investigation wasn&rsquo;t thorough enough to satisfy the Runyon family.</p>
<p>So Jeff rented a plane to fly over the area and search for his daughter himself.</p>
<p>When nothing turned up with that search, he took his shotgun and combed through the hills</p>
<p>on foot, but still there was no trace of Rachel or her kidnapper.</p>
<p>By Monday, August 30th, four days after Rachel&rsquo;s kidnapping, the Runyons started to doubt that</p>
<p>they would ever see their daughter again.</p>
<p>An article ran on the front page of the Daily Herald that said the family feared the worst.</p>
<p>Friends were quoted in that same article and recalled that Jeff and Elaine still weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eating or sleeping because they were so distraught and they were so focused on finding their</p>
<p>daughter.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think that Rachel was being held for ransom because A, they hadn&rsquo;t received</p>
<p>a ransom note of any kind, and B, they weren&rsquo;t rich by any means.</p>
<p>Jeff told the Bellingham Herald that they were, quote, everyday ordinary people living</p>
<p>paycheck to paycheck.</p>
<p>The Runyons started to develop a new theory about what could have happened to their daughter</p>
<p>and it broadened their search area to the entire country.</p>
<p>They worried that perhaps Rachel had been taken and sold in an illegal adoption or human</p>
<p>trafficking ring.</p>
<p>As the days dragged by, investigators were also becoming more convinced that Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kidnapper had taken her out of state.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not clear where the adoption or out-of-state travel theories came from, but the Runyons</p>
<p>set out to get national attention for their daughter&rsquo;s case because of this.</p>
<p>Eleven days after Rachel was taken, Jeff and Elaine appeared on NBC&rsquo;s The Today Show begging</p>
<p>anyone with information about their daughter&rsquo;s disappearance to come forward.</p>
<p>They also issued a nationwide plea for anyone adopting a young girl in the next year or</p>
<p>anyone who so much as saw a new girl in the neighborhood to be certain that she was not</p>
<p>their little Rachel.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Kansas City Times, Elaine said, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Somebody knows this man.</p>
<p>Somebody knows this girl.</p>
<p>If you see anyone pulling a child or fighting with a child, ask her, are you Rachel Runyon?</p>
<p>Who is your mommy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>For weeks, this is all the Runyons could do, plead with the public, hang up flyers, and</p>
<p>get as much media attention as possible.</p>
<p>Then, late in the evening on September 19th, almost a month after Rachel&rsquo;s disappearance,</p>
<p>a phone call came in that would end the search for Rachel and begin a whole new nightmare</p>
<p>for the family.</p>
<p>It was their bishop on the other end.</p>
<p>He and the mayor of Sunset wanted to drop by the house because they had an update on</p>
<p>the investigation.</p>
<p>Now the Runyons knew a house call that late at night meant it had to be significant news</p>
<p>in Rachel&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>They said, you know, we found Rachel and I&rsquo;m like, and?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m still hanging on to hope she&rsquo;s alive and they said, a small child&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>has been found and I&rsquo;m like, body?</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t compute, like, does that mean she&rsquo;s dead or it&rsquo;s a body and she&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>Just hanging on to every last, you know, hope that you could even have.</p>
<p>The Runyons were told that a family was out for a Sunday drive and a little hike up a</p>
<p>mountain canyon about 20 miles from Sunset when they got to a stream and they saw what</p>
<p>they thought was a doll in the water, covered partly by some brush.</p>
<p>But it hadn&rsquo;t been a doll.</p>
<p>It was a young girl whose hands and feet were bound with nylon rope and it looked like she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been there a while.</p>
<p>As the bishop and mayor sat with the Runyons, investigators were almost positive it was</p>
<p>Rachel, but they needed to formally identify her before releasing the information to the</p>
<p>public.</p>
<p>But identifying the young girl proved to be challenging.</p>
<p>She matched the basic description of Rachel, but she was so decomposed that many identifying</p>
<p>markers were no longer there.</p>
<p>And further complicating things was the fact that Rachel didn&rsquo;t have any dental records</p>
<p>for comparison.</p>
<p>Police tried comparing fingerprints, but that also proved to be difficult because of the</p>
<p>amount of time that the girl had been in the water.</p>
<p>After a few days of trying fingerprinting and other tests, the examiner knew that there</p>
<p>was only one other option, having Rachel&rsquo;s parents make the identification.</p>
<p>Police were hesitant to let them view her, but Elaine and Jeff wanted to bring an end</p>
<p>to their waiting.</p>
<p>So they braced themselves, and when they saw her, there was no doubt in their minds that</p>
<p>it was their Rachel.</p>
<p>Elaine was heartbroken as she confirmed the clothing was her daughter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And though there were no dental records, a mother knows, she recognized Rachel&rsquo;s tooth</p>
<p>that was pushed forward and the other one that was chipped.</p>
<p>It was her baby girl.</p>
<p>Even though her identity was confirmed, her cause of death and date of death were proving</p>
<p>to be even more difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Investigators knew that she&rsquo;d been in that creek for quite some time, perhaps even since</p>
<p>August 26, the day she was kidnapped.</p>
<p>But pinpointing it exactly was something that they wouldn&rsquo;t know for sure until they</p>
<p>caught her killer.</p>
<p>There were no markings or wounds on Rachel to indicate that she&rsquo;d been shot or stabbed,</p>
<p>so many people assumed she&rsquo;d been strangled or suffocated.</p>
<p>But they could never prove that because of the state her body was in when she was found.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also unclear if she&rsquo;d been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Newspapers at the time reported conflicting information, but Elaine told our reporting</p>
<p>team that as far as she knows, police never said that Rachel had been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>On September 23, four days after her body was found, Rachel was laid to rest.</p>
<p>Hundreds attended her funeral and remembered the young life that was unfairly stolen from</p>
<p>them, even though it had barely begun.</p>
<p>Rachel was remembered as the sweetest little girl you&rsquo;d ever meet and just as cute as</p>
<p>could be.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d even recently won a beauty pageant and been crowned Little Miss Sunset.</p>
<p>She actually was a very quiet little girl.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t one that ran around bawling all the time.</p>
<p>She just was really an angel on earth.</p>
<p>The Runyons were ready to turn their grief into action immediately after identifying</p>
<p>Rachel.</p>
<p>At her daughter&rsquo;s funeral, Elaine told the crowd that Rachel didn&rsquo;t die for nothing.</p>
<p>She said that she was determined to make sure something positive came out of her little</p>
<p>girl&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t take long for Elaine&rsquo;s promise to come true.</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s case acted as a catalyst for change in the community.</p>
<p>Parents across Utah started compiling identification packets for their children in case their kids</p>
<p>ever went missing.</p>
<p>Within a month, the parents of more than 30,000 children had their fingerprints, blood type,</p>
<p>and dental records recorded in case tragedy ever struck.</p>
<p>Parent Teacher Association chapters across the state were reviving child protection programs,</p>
<p>and almost every law enforcement agency in Utah introduced new school programs teaching</p>
<p>kids not to trust strangers.</p>
<p>While Rachel&rsquo;s family was making a difference in Utah, police were knee deep in the dozens</p>
<p>of tips that were pouring in.</p>
<p>Even though Rachel&rsquo;s body had been found in neighboring Morgan County, the Sunset Police</p>
<p>Department retained jurisdiction, with Lt. Phil Olmsted spearheading the investigation.</p>
<p>One of the tips that came in came from a man who said that he knew the motive behind Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>He claimed that she&rsquo;d been killed for a snuff film, which is a recording of an actual murder.</p>
<p>The term was coined in the 70s following the Manson family murders and the theory that</p>
<p>those killings were recorded.</p>
<p>But law enforcement investigating Rachel&rsquo;s case didn&rsquo;t think much of the claim and kind</p>
<p>of brushed off the tip.</p>
<p>But things just got more strange.</p>
<p>Not long after Rachel&rsquo;s funeral, her father Jeff was visiting her gravesite and saw something</p>
<p>that truly freaked him out.</p>
<p>Laying on Rachel&rsquo;s headstone was a single black rose.</p>
<p>The rose hadn&rsquo;t been there on the day of the funeral, and Jeff found it ominous.</p>
<p>The Runyon family thought if the flower wasn&rsquo;t left by someone who was mourning Rachel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>loss, maybe it was put there by the killer.</p>
<p>And a few days later, another black rose was mysteriously left on Rachel&rsquo;s gravestone.</p>
<p>As suspicious as the roses were, police couldn&rsquo;t figure out who was leaving them.</p>
<p>If it were me, I would have set up some kind of surveillance to stake out Rachel&rsquo;s grave</p>
<p>and see who was leaving the flowers, but as far as we can tell, that never happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also unclear if police ever checked with local flower shops to see if anyone had been</p>
<p>purchasing single black roses multiple times.</p>
<p>I mean, to be fair, maybe they thought it was just some kid playing a prank, or maybe</p>
<p>they felt like they had bigger fish to fry in their investigation, because around the</p>
<p>same time, officers were starting to consider a possible serial killer connection to Rachel&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>In 1983, a man named Arthur Gary Bishop confessed to several kidnappings and murders near Salt</p>
<p>Lake City from 1979 to 1983.</p>
<p>So officers in Sunset couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if he&rsquo;d also targeted Rachel.</p>
<p>Bishop was known to lure his young victims from public places before sexually assaulting</p>
<p>and killing them.</p>
<p>The only difference was Bishop&rsquo;s other known victims were all boys between the ages of</p>
<p>4 and 13.</p>
<p>Police still questioned him about Rachel, but he denied having any involvement in her murder.</p>
<p>And after that, Rachel&rsquo;s case went cold.</p>
<p>The tips that were once pouring in were now barely a trickle, and Rachel&rsquo;s name disappeared</p>
<p>from the headlines.</p>
<p>It seemed like Rachel&rsquo;s killer had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>There was simply no trace of him.</p>
<p>That is until 1985, two and a half years after Rachel&rsquo;s death, when police got a strange call.</p>
<p>Someone phoned in to tell police that they&rsquo;d found a disturbing message scrawled across</p>
<p>the men&rsquo;s restroom wall in a 24-hour laundromat that was just a few miles from the Runyons'</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>Officers responded to the laundromat right away to see the message for themselves, and</p>
<p>it made their skin crawl.</p>
<p>The writing was in all caps and read, quote,</p>
<p>And below those words was a drawing that made the message even creepier, an upside-down</p>
<p>cross surrounded by three sixes.</p>
<p>Police cut out the portion of the wall that contained the message to keep it for evidence,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t much they could do with it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like someone was caught in the act of writing the message, and security cameras</p>
<p>were nowhere near as prevalent as they are today, so it&rsquo;s likely that the writer of</p>
<p>the message wasn&rsquo;t even caught on camera.</p>
<p>So finding this didn&rsquo;t really get law enforcement that much closer to catching their killer.</p>
<p>But it did give investigators another viable theory to work with.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Olmsted discussed his theory on NBC&rsquo;s Unsolved Mysteries.</p>
<p>With the upside-down cross and the triple six, it indicates to us that there could very</p>
<p>well be a satanic cult involved in the kidnapping of Rachel Runyon.</p>
<p>Investigators held on to the theory of possible cult involvement, but it was just that, a</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>There was nothing else to go on.</p>
<p>And by the way, if you research any murder from the early 80s, you&rsquo;re likely to find</p>
<p>out that somewhere along the way, police considered satanic cult involvement.</p>
<p>It was a popular, vague, and widespread theory for almost all homicides back then.</p>
<p>Anyway, after the graffiti was found, things in Rachel&rsquo;s case went quiet again.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 1989 that things really started to pick back up.</p>
<p>In April of that year, detectives got a tip from a woman who said that she knew who killed</p>
<p>Rachel.</p>
<p>In fact, she was related to the killer.</p>
<p>This woman said that it was her brother who&rsquo;d committed the murder.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, the woman&rsquo;s story hearkened back to a tip from six years earlier in the</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>She claimed that Rachel&rsquo;s torture and murder had been videotaped and made into a snuff</p>
<p>film.</p>
<p>Because this woman confirmed a story that they&rsquo;d already heard, and one that they</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t made public at that point, investigators thought that she seemed credible.</p>
<p>So they struck a deal with her.</p>
<p>They would pay her as a confidential informant, and she would arrange for their undercover</p>
<p>agents to buy a copy of the alleged snuff film that her brother made.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Salt Lake Tribune, agents tried three separate times to purchase</p>
<p>the film, but each time the deal fell through for one reason or another.</p>
<p>With each failed attempt, police grew more suspicious of their informant, and after the</p>
<p>third try, authorities charged her with theft by deception and obstructing justice, both</p>
<p>of which she ended up pleading guilty to.</p>
<p>She also recanted most of the information she&rsquo;d told police.</p>
<p>But police still held on to the snuff film theory.</p>
<p>When Rachel&rsquo;s case was featured on that episode of Unsolved Mysteries in 1989, it</p>
<p>was the main theory discussed.</p>
<p>The episode even showed the dress that Rachel would have likely been wearing in the film,</p>
<p>if anyone were to find it.</p>
<p>And after that episode aired, the floodgates opened.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 150 tips came pouring in from all over the country.</p>
<p>It was exactly what law enforcement hoped would happen.</p>
<p>Belief was brought back into the heartbreaking case that had been sitting on their shelf</p>
<p>unsolved for the past seven years.</p>
<p>Every lead that came in, police investigated as best they could.</p>
<p>But as promising as some of the tips seemed, none of them panned out in the end.</p>
<p>So investigators were once again back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>And they were at that drawing board for decades.</p>
<p>While the investigation was stalled, Elaine was still hard at work fulfilling the promise</p>
<p>that she made at Rachel&rsquo;s funeral, that something positive would come from her death.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Rachel Alert was created, which was a child abduction alert system for Utah.</p>
<p>It actually laid the groundwork for what would later be standardized across the nation as</p>
<p>the Amber Alert system.</p>
<p>For a long time, it seemed like the story ended there.</p>
<p>But thankfully it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>37 years after Rachel&rsquo;s kidnapping and murder, private investigator Jason Jensen started</p>
<p>looking into her case.</p>
<p>And what he unearthed shocked everyone.</p>
<p>And it led police to their most promising suspect yet.</p>
<p>In late 2019, Jason&rsquo;s wheels started turning.</p>
<p>The Utah Cold Case Coalition, which he co-founded, had just helped solve a 1970s cold case in</p>
<p>which police were looking for a black man as their suspect.</p>
<p>But as it turned out, the actual killer was Hispanic.</p>
<p>This made Jason wonder about another infamous Utah cold case, Rachel Runyon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He wondered if investigators had gotten tunnel vision on her case as well and mistakenly</p>
<p>assumed that their killer was a black man.</p>
<p>So on Christmas Eve, Jason decided that he couldn&rsquo;t keep this theory to himself any</p>
<p>longer.</p>
<p>He reached out to Elaine and asked a question no one had asked before.</p>
<p>I said, hey, Miss Runyon, is there any possibility that your son may have witnessed a Hispanic</p>
<p>male instead of an African American?</p>
<p>And to Jason&rsquo;s surprise, she got back to him the very same day.</p>
<p>After checking with her son Justin, Elaine responded saying that her son no longer thought</p>
<p>the man was black and just remembered him as having a dark complexion.</p>
<p>When you think about it, he was five years old.</p>
<p>He was Rachel&rsquo;s older brother, and he witnessed her being abducted.</p>
<p>And he said to his mother that he was black.</p>
<p>Well, you know, a five-year-old&rsquo;s experience with other ethnicity is going to be very limited</p>
<p>because this is a Caucasian family in Sunset, Utah, where other than at the Air Force Base,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re talking a community where there&rsquo;s very little diversity in 1982.</p>
<p>Well, in 2019, when I contacted him, he was 42.</p>
<p>So his experience has completely altered, you know, and broadened in his life experience.</p>
<p>So he ended up saying to me that he was never happy with the composite sketch that was released.</p>
<p>Not only was Justin unhappy with the person portrayed in the sketch, but he said a key</p>
<p>facial feature wasn&rsquo;t drawn correctly.</p>
<p>Something that might have made all the difference in the investigation.</p>
<p>He recalled vividly that the man who took his little sister had a very pronounced gap</p>
<p>in his mustache.</p>
<p>So Jason and the Runyon family had the composite sketch redrawn to better reflect the man Justin</p>
<p>saw on August 26, 1982.</p>
<p>For some reason, the new sketch still didn&rsquo;t include a gap in the mustache.</p>
<p>So local news station, ABC 4 Utah, took it upon themselves to make an alternate version</p>
<p>of this composite, this time with the gap.</p>
<p>You can actually see pictures of that sketch on our website as well.</p>
<p>Now that they were armed with a more realistic composite of the killer, Jason and the Runyons</p>
<p>wasted no time.</p>
<p>They made a post on the official Rachel Runyon Facebook page showcasing the new sketch and</p>
<p>announcing that the suspect description had changed.</p>
<p>They were now looking for a man with dark complexion and a mustache gap.</p>
<p>As soon as that information got out there, it wasn&rsquo;t 15 minutes that a key witness came</p>
<p>forward and said, hey, guess what?</p>
<p>My parents talked about turning in my uncle because they thought that he killed Rachel,</p>
<p>but my mom talked my dad out of it.</p>
<p>The guy that this person is talking about is a convicted child molester who we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to call Lane, and then going forward, we&rsquo;ll bleep his name.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing this because this theory isn&rsquo;t widely agreed upon by everyone involved</p>
<p>in the case.</p>
<p>She said that her dad was going to report as the possible suspect, but the mom talked</p>
<p>him out of it saying, oh, you&rsquo;re just prejudiced because you don&rsquo;t like him because he&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you know, a child molester.</p>
<p>But then said, but they&rsquo;re looking for an African-American anyway and not African-American.</p>
<p>So she succeeded talking him out of reporting him.</p>
<p>As promising as this lead seemed, there was a problem.</p>
<p>Lane had died just two years before his relative came forward and reported her suspicions.</p>
<p>But the more Jason looked into Lane, the more he became convinced of his involvement in</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He was in and out of prison his entire life with convictions for theft, aggravated battery,</p>
<p>and possession of controlled substances.</p>
<p>Run-ins with the law didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>In 1970, he was convicted of sexually assaulting his kid&rsquo;s babysitter.</p>
<p>Also in 1970, he allegedly assaulted his neighbor, though it&rsquo;s not clear if there were charges</p>
<p>ever filed for that assault.</p>
<p>And then in 2005, was arrested again for sexual abuse of a minor.</p>
<p>One of the things that struck me, given the fact that, you know, people will ask me, well,</p>
<p>why do you think that he killed Rachel?</p>
<p>Well, typically, specifically sex offenders, they will escalate their crime the next go</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, my mistake, my bad.</p>
<p>My mistake was I left a witness when I raped before.</p>
<p>So the next go around, they kill their victim because they don&rsquo;t want any witness.</p>
<p>But oftentimes you see that escalation where this first offense, they went and did serve</p>
<p>time because of the rape offense.</p>
<p>The next time it&rsquo;s a murder charge.</p>
<p>Jason did some digging and discovered that **** had been released from prison in 1981.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t return to prison until 1986, which meant that he would have been a free</p>
<p>man during Rachel&rsquo;s 1982 abduction and murder.</p>
<p>Not only that, Jason said there&rsquo;s something else that makes **** a promising suspect in</p>
<p>his mind.</p>
<p>Something big.</p>
<p>**** had a blue Ford Pinto with woodgrain paneling on the sides, the exact kind of car</p>
<p>that Rachel was seen getting into with her kidnapper.</p>
<p>According to **** family, he kept that car behind his parents&rsquo; home, which was a stoplight</p>
<p>away from the police station and two stoplights away from the Runyon&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>**** wasn&rsquo;t in jail.</p>
<p>He stayed in his parents&rsquo; basement.</p>
<p>The entrance was behind the home, so he would always park his Pinto behind the house.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that no authorities ever saw the car, which matched the descriptions</p>
<p>of the kidnappers to a T.</p>
<p>Also bore a striking resemblance to the updated composite.</p>
<p>Jason said that the nose in particular was quote, almost a perfect match.</p>
<p>Even the poofy hair was spot on.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, **** was also known to sport a mustache with a pronounced gap.</p>
<p>And there was something else about **** that matched the suspect profile Jason and the</p>
<p>Runyons had compiled.</p>
<p>They were sure whoever killed Rachel was from the area.</p>
<p>And what makes them so sure is what the kidnapper said to the three kids before he abducted</p>
<p>Rachel.</p>
<p>The man told the Runyon kids that he&rsquo;d take them to Bobco&rsquo;s to get ice cream.</p>
<p>But Bobco&rsquo;s was a locally owned grocery store.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like a chain or even a popular ice cream shop that lots of people knew about.</p>
<p>It was just like a regular mom and pop grocery store that happened to have a little ice cream</p>
<p>shop inside, something an outsider wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But even with all of these little details lining up and pointing to **** as the killer,</p>
<p>investigators needed more.</p>
<p>All the evidence so far was purely circumstantial.</p>
<p>The criminal record, the kind of car he owned, where he lived, the fact that his family at</p>
<p>one point seriously considered reporting him as the possible kidnapper.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t have all just been coincidence.</p>
<p>And Jason knew police would need something more concrete to be satisfied that **** was</p>
<p>their guy and close the case for good.</p>
<p>Something like a confession, which again was impossible because their suspect was long</p>
<p>gone.</p>
<p>Or maybe DNA.</p>
<p>Jason jumped on that idea and reached out right away to ****&rsquo;s daughter, who lived</p>
<p>just 10 minutes southeast of Sunset.</p>
<p>I explained to her that we had a tip that matched and that was saying that **** may</p>
<p>have been responsible for this murder and that a DNA sample would rule him out if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a match.</p>
<p>So she agreed to submit to a DNA test for us.</p>
<p>Once Jason had the DNA from ****&rsquo;s daughter, it was time to test her DNA against the DNA</p>
<p>found at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not clear where that DNA came from, whether it was from clothing or swabs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not clear how well preserved the DNA was.</p>
<p>But regardless, in 2020, the sample Jason collected and the samples that law enforcement</p>
<p>was holding onto were all sent to Intermountain Forensics, a nonprofit forensic DNA testing</p>
<p>lab in Utah.</p>
<p>And that is where the case stands today.</p>
<p>The results of the tests are still pending, and it&rsquo;s unknown how much longer it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be till the Runyon family gets answers.</p>
<p>For Elaine, the waiting game has been excruciating.</p>
<p>We just like to have the closure.</p>
<p>We deserve the closure.</p>
<p>For 40 years, the Runyon family has been waiting for the answers they deserve.</p>
<p>And although there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel, they know that nothing</p>
<p>is guaranteed.</p>
<p>The DNA results from the lab could bring them right back to square one.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t imagine having to sit with that fear for years like the Runyons have.</p>
<p>Their family deserves closure, and Rachel deserves justice.</p>
<p>If you have any information about the 1982 abduction and murder of Rachel Runyon, please</p>
<p>speak up.</p>
