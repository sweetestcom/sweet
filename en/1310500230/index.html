    <p>The following is a conversation with Jo Bowler,</p>
<p>a mathematics educator at Stanford</p>
<p>and co founder of ucubed.org</p>
<p>that seeks to inspire young minds</p>
<p>with the beauty of mathematics.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Jo Bowler.</p>
<p>What to you is beautiful about mathematics?</p>
<p>I love a mathematics that some people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even think of as mathematics,</p>
<p>which is beautiful, creative mathematics,</p>
<p>where we look at maths in different ways,</p>
<p>we visualize it,</p>
<p>we think about different solutions to problems.</p>
<p>A lot of people think of maths</p>
<p>as you have one method and one answer.</p>
<p>And what I love about maths</p>
<p>is the multiple different ways you can see things,</p>
<p>different methods, different ways of seeing different.</p>
<p>In some cases, different solutions.</p>
<p>So that is what is beautiful to me about mathematics,</p>
<p>that you can see and solve it in many different ways.</p>
<p>And also the sad part that many people think</p>
<p>that maths is just one answer and one method.</p>
<p>So to you, the beauty emerges</p>
<p>when you have a problem with a solution</p>
<p>and you start adding other solutions,</p>
<p>simpler solutions, weirder solutions, more interesting,</p>
<p>some of their visual, some of their algebraic,</p>
<p>geometry, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I always say</p>
<p>that you can take any maths area and make it visual.</p>
<p>And we say to teachers,</p>
<p>give us your most dry, boring maths</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll make it a visual, interesting, creative problem.</p>
<p>And it turns out you can do that with any area of maths.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve given,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a great disservice to kids and others</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s always been numbers, lots and lots of numbers.</p>
<p>Numbers can be great,</p>
<p>but you can think about maths in other ways besides numbers.</p>
<p>Do you find that most people are better visual learners</p>
<p>or is this just something that&rsquo;s complimentary?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the kind of the full spectrum of students</p>
<p>in the way they like to explore maths, would you say?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely people who come into the classes I do</p>
<p>who are more interested in visual thinking</p>
<p>and like visual approaches.</p>
<p>But it turns out what the neuroscience is telling us</p>
<p>is that when we think about maths,</p>
<p>there are two visual pathways in the brain</p>
<p>and we should all be thinking about it visually.</p>
<p>Some approaches have been to say,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re a visual learner, so we&rsquo;ll give you visuals</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not a visual learner.</p>
<p>But actually, if you think you&rsquo;re not a visual learner,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably more important that you have a visual approach.</p>
<p>So you can develop that part of your brain.</p>
<p>So you were saying that there&rsquo;s some kind</p>
<p>of interconnected aspect to it.</p>
<p>So the visual connects with the non visual.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is what the neuroscience has shown us</p>
<p>that when you work on a maths problem,</p>
<p>there are five different brain pathways</p>
<p>and that the most high achieving people in the world</p>
<p>are people who have more connections between these pathways.</p>
<p>So if you see a maths problem with numbers,</p>
<p>but you also see it visually,</p>
<p>that will cause a connection to happen in your brain</p>
<p>between these pathways.</p>
<p>And if you maybe write about it with words,</p>
<p>that would cause another connection</p>
<p>or maybe you build it with something physical</p>
<p>that would cause a different connection.</p>
<p>And what we want for kids is we call it</p>
<p>a multi dimensional experience of maths,</p>
<p>seeing it in different ways,</p>
<p>experiencing it in different ways,</p>
<p>that will cause that great connected brain.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s these stories of physicists doing the same.</p>
<p>I find physicists are often better</p>
<p>at building that part of their brain</p>
<p>of using visualization for intuition building,</p>
<p>because you ultimately want to understand</p>
<p>the like the deepest secret underneath this problem.</p>
<p>And for that, you have to intuit your way there.</p>
<p>And you mentioned offline that one of the ways</p>
<p>you might approach a problem</p>
<p>is to try to tell a story about it.</p>
<p>And some of it is like legend,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not always is, you know,</p>
<p>you have Einstein thinking about a train,</p>
<p>you know, and the speed of light</p>
<p>and you know, that kind of intuition is useful.</p>
<p>You start to like imagine a physical world,</p>
<p>like how does this idea manifest itself</p>
<p>in the physical world?</p>
<p>And then start playing in your mind</p>
<p>with that physical world and think,</p>
<p>Is this going to be true?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Einstein is well known for thinking visually.</p>
<p>And people talk about how he really didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to go anywhere with problems</p>
<p>without thinking about them visually.</p>
<p>But the other thing you mentioned</p>
<p>that sparked something for me is thinking with intuition,</p>
<p>like having intuition about math problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s often absent in math class,</p>
<p>the idea that you might think about a problem</p>
<p>and use your intuition, but so important.</p>
<p>And when mathematicians are interviewed,</p>
<p>they will very frequently talk about the role</p>
<p>of intuition in solving problems,</p>
<p>but not commonly acknowledged or brought into education.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Like if you task yourself with building an intuition</p>
<p>about a problem, that&rsquo;s where you start to pull in,</p>
<p>like what is the pattern I&rsquo;m seeing?</p>
<p>In order to understand the pattern,</p>
<p>you might want to then start utilizing visualization.</p>
<p>But ultimately, that&rsquo;s all in service</p>
<p>of like solving the puzzle, like cracking it open</p>
<p>to get the simple explanation of why things are wrong.</p>
<p>Why things are the way they are,</p>
<p>as opposed to, like you said, having a particular algorithm</p>
<p>that you can then execute to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, like reasoning is really hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, I love to value what&rsquo;s hard in maths</p>
<p>instead of being afraid of it.</p>
<p>We know that when you struggle,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a really good time for your brain.</p>
<p>You want to be struggling when you&rsquo;re thinking about things.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s hard to think intuitively about something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a really good time for your brain.</p>
<p>I used to work with somebody called Sebastian Thrun,</p>
<p>who is a great sort of mathematician,</p>
<p>you might think of him, AI person.</p>
<p>And I remember in one interview I did with him,</p>
<p>he talked about how they&rsquo;d built robots,</p>
<p>I think for the Smithsonian,</p>
<p>and how they were having this trouble</p>
<p>with them picking up white noise.</p>
<p>And he said they had to solve it.</p>
<p>They had to work out what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and how he intuitively worked out what the problem was.</p>
<p>But then it took him three weeks to show it mathematically.</p>
<p>I thought that was really interesting</p>
<p>that how you can have this intuition</p>
<p>and know something works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of different from going through</p>
<p>that long mathematical process of proving it,</p>
<p>but so important.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think probably our brains are evolved</p>
<p>as like intuition machines</p>
<p>and the math of like showing it like formally</p>
<p>is probably an extra thing that we&rsquo;re not designed for.</p>
<p>You see that with Feynman and his,</p>
<p>I mean, it just, all of these physicists,</p>
<p>definitely you see starting with intuition,</p>
<p>sometimes starting with an experiment</p>
<p>and then the experiment inspires intuition.</p>
<p>But you can think of an experiment</p>
<p>as a kind of visualization.</p>
<p>Just like let&rsquo;s take whatever the heck we&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>and draw it and draw like the pattern as it evolves,</p>
<p>as the thing grows for N equals one,</p>
<p>for N equals two, N equals three,</p>
<p>you start to play with it.</p>
<p>And then in the modern day, which I loved doing is,</p>
<p>you can write a program that then visualizes it for you.</p>
<p>And then you can start exploring it programmatically.</p>
<p>And then you can do so interactively too.</p>
<p>I tend to not like interactive</p>
<p>because it takes way too much work</p>
<p>because you have to click and move and stuff.</p>
<p>I love to interact through writing programs,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my particular brain, software engineer.</p>
<p>So like you can do all these kinds of visualizations</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the tools of visualization,</p>
<p>like color, all of those kinds of things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually not taught very much.</p>
<p>Like the art of visualization.</p>
<p>Not taught.</p>
<p>And we love as well color coding.</p>
<p>Like when you represent something mathematically,</p>
<p>you can show color to show the growth and kind of code that.</p>
<p>So if I have an algebraic expression for a pattern,</p>
<p>maybe I show the X with a certain color,</p>
<p>but also write in that color</p>
<p>so you can see the relationship.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>And yeah, particularly in our work</p>
<p>with elementary teachers,</p>
<p>many of them come to our workshops</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re literally in tears</p>
<p>when they see things making sense visually</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve spent their whole lives</p>
<p>not realizing you can really understand things</p>
<p>with these visuals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite powerful.</p>
<p>You say that there&rsquo;s something valuable to learning</p>
<p>when the thing that you&rsquo;re doing is challenging,</p>
<p>is difficult.</p>
<p>So a lot of people say math is hard</p>
<p>or math is too hard or too hard for me.</p>
<p>Do you think math should be easy or should it be hard?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great when things are challenging,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really key</p>
<p>to being able to deal with challenging maths</p>
<p>and that is knowing that you can do it.</p>
<p>And I think the problem in education</p>
<p>is a lot of people have got this idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re either born with a maths brain or you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So when they start to struggle,</p>
<p>they think, oh, I don&rsquo;t have that maths brain.</p>
<p>And then they will literally sort of switch off</p>
<p>in their brain and things will go downhill from that point.</p>
<p>So struggle becomes a lot easier</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to struggle if you don&rsquo;t have that idea,</p>
<p>but you know that you can do it.</p>
<p>You have to go through this struggle to get there,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re able to do that.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re hampered in being able to struggle</p>
<p>with these ideas we&rsquo;ve been given about what we can do.</p>
<p>Can I ask a difficult question here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of, I don&rsquo;t know what the right term is,</p>
<p>but some people struggle with learning in different ways,</p>
<p>like their brain is constructed in different ways.</p>
<p>And how much should, as educators,</p>
<p>should we make room for that?</p>
<p>So how do you know the difference between this is hard</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t like doing hard things</p>
<p>versus my brain is wired in a way</p>
<p>where I need to learn in very different ways.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t learn it this way.</p>
<p>How do you find that line?</p>
<p>How do you operate in that gray area?</p>
<p>So this is why being a teacher is so hard</p>
<p>and people really don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>how difficult teaching is when you&rsquo;re faced with,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 30 students who think in different ways.</p>
<p>So, but this is also why I believe it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>to have this multi dimensional approach to maths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve really offered it in one way,</p>
<p>which is here&rsquo;s some numbers in a method.</p>
<p>You follow me, do what I just did and then reproduce it.</p>
<p>And so there are some kids who like doing that</p>
<p>and they do well.</p>
<p>And a lot of kids who don&rsquo;t like doing it</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>But when you open up maths and you give,</p>
<p>you let kids experience it in different ways,</p>
<p>maybe visually with numbers, with words.</p>
<p>What happens is kids,</p>
<p>there are many more kids who can access it.</p>
<p>So those different brain wirings you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>where some people are just more able to do something</p>
<p>in a particular way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we want to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons we want to open it up</p>
<p>so that there are different ways of accessing it.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s not really a problem.</p>
<p>So I grew up in the Soviet Union and fell in love</p>
<p>with math early.</p>
<p>I was forced into math early</p>
<p>and fell in love through force.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Well, good that you fell in love about the force.</p>
<p>Well, but something we talked about a little bit</p>
<p>is there is such a value for excellence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s competitive and it&rsquo;s also everybody kind of looks up</p>
<p>the definition of success is being in a particular class</p>
<p>is being really good at it.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s not improving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being really good.</p>
<p>I mean, we are much more like that with sports, for example.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s understood,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to star on the basketball team</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna start on the basketball team</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to be better than the other guys,</p>
<p>the other girls on the team.</p>
<p>So that coupled with the belief,</p>
<p>this could be partially a communist belief, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but the belief that everybody is capable of being great.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not great, that&rsquo;s your fault</p>
<p>and you need to work harder.</p>
<p>And I remember I had a sense that probably delusional,</p>
<p>but I could win a Nobel prize.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that entails.</p>
<p>But I thought, like my dad early on told me just offhand</p>
<p>and it always stuck with me that if you can figure out</p>
<p>how to build a time machine, how to travel back in time,</p>
<p>it will probably give you a Nobel prize.</p>
<p>And I remember early in my life thinking</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to invent the time machine.</p>
<p>And like the tools of mathematics were in service</p>
<p>of that dream of winning the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly. I didn&rsquo;t really think in those concrete terms,</p>
<p>but I just thought I could be great at feeling.</p>
<p>And then when you struggle,</p>
<p>the belief that you could be great is like,</p>
<p>struggle is good.</p>
<p>Right, pushes you on, yeah.</p>
<p>And so the other thing about the Soviet system</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d love to hear your comments about</p>
<p>is just the sheer like hours of math.</p>
<p>Like the number of courses,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about a lot of geometry, a lot more geometry.</p>
<p>I think in the American system,</p>
<p>you take maybe one year of geometry.</p>
<p>In high school, yeah.</p>
<p>In high school.</p>
<p>First of all, geometry is beautiful, it&rsquo;s visual.</p>
<p>And then you get to reason through proofs</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>In Russia, I remember just being nailed</p>
<p>over and over with geometry.</p>
<p>It was just nonstop.</p>
<p>And then of course there&rsquo;s different perspectives</p>
<p>on calculus and just the whole,</p>
<p>the sense was that math is like fundamental</p>
<p>to the development of the human mind.</p>
<p>So math, but also science and literature, by the way,</p>
<p>was also hit very hard.</p>
<p>Like we read a lot of serious adult stuff.</p>
<p>America does that a little bit too.</p>
<p>They challenge young adults with good literature,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t challenge adults very much with math.</p>
<p>So those two things, valuing excellence</p>
<p>and just a lot of math in the curriculum.</p>
<p>Do you think, do you find that interesting?</p>
<p>Because it seems to have been successful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of success,</p>
<p>people coming through the Soviet system.</p>
<p>I think something that&rsquo;s very different to the US</p>
<p>and other countries in the world</p>
<p>is that idea that excellence is important</p>
<p>and you can get there if you work hard.</p>
<p>In the US, there&rsquo;s an idea that excellence is important,</p>
<p>but then kids are given the idea in many ways</p>
<p>that you can either do it</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re one of the people who can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So many students in the school system</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re one of the kids who can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no point in trying hard</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re never going to get there.</p>
<p>So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge.</p>
<p>And it seems from what you&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>that in the Soviet Union, that idea is really different.</p>
<p>Now, the downside of that idea that anybody can get there</p>
<p>if you work hard is that thought</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re not getting there, it&rsquo;s your fault.</p>
<p>And I would add something into that.</p>
<p>I would say that anybody can get there,</p>
<p>but they need to work hard and they also need good teaching</p>
<p>because there are some people who really can&rsquo;t get there</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not given access to that good teaching.</p>
<p>So, but that would be huge, that change.</p>
<p>As to doing lots of maths,</p>
<p>if maths was interesting and open and creative</p>
<p>and multi dimensional, I would be all for it.</p>
<p>We actually run summer camps at Stanford</p>
<p>where we invite kids in and we give them this maths</p>
<p>that I love.</p>
<p>And in our camp classrooms, they were three hours long.</p>
<p>And when we were planning, the teachers were like three hours,</p>
<p>are we going to be able to keep the kids excited</p>
<p>for three hours?</p>
<p>Turned out they didn&rsquo;t want to go to break or lunch.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be so into these mathematical patterns.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t stop them.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>So yeah, if maths was more like that,</p>
<p>then I think having more of it would be a really good thing.</p>
<p>So what age are you talking about?</p>
<p>Is there, could you comment on what age is like</p>
<p>the most important when people quit math</p>
<p>or give up on themselves or on math in general?</p>
<p>And perhaps that age or something earlier</p>
<p>is really an important moment for them to discover,</p>
<p>to be inspired to discover the magic of math.</p>
<p>I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves</p>
<p>and maths around from about fifth grade.</p>
<p>And then those middle school years are really important.</p>
<p>And fifth grade can be pivotal for kids</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re allowed to explore</p>
<p>and think in good ways</p>
<p>in the early grades of elementary school.</p>
<p>But fifth grade teachers are often like,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re going to prepare you now for middle school</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to give you grades and lots of tests.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when kids start to feel really badly</p>
<p>about themselves.</p>
<p>And so middle school years,</p>
<p>our camps are middle school students.</p>
<p>We think of those years as really pivotal.</p>
<p>Many kids in those years are deciding,</p>
<p>yes, I&rsquo;m going to keep going with STEM subjects</p>
<p>or no, I&rsquo;m not, that this isn&rsquo;t for me.</p>
<p>So, I mean, all years are important</p>
<p>and in all years you can kind of switch kids</p>
<p>and get them on a different pathway.</p>
<p>But I think those middle school years are really important.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the role of the teacher in this?</p>
<p>So one is the explanation of the subject,</p>
<p>but do you think teachers should almost do like one on one,</p>
<p>you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?</p>
<p>Like that energy of like.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study that was done,</p>
<p>it was actually done in high school English classrooms</p>
<p>where all kids wrote an essay for their teacher.</p>
<p>And this was done as an experiment.</p>
<p>Half of the kids got feedback from their teacher,</p>
<p>diagnostic feedback, which is great.</p>
<p>But for half of the kids,</p>
<p>it said an extra sentence at the bottom</p>
<p>that the researchers had put on.</p>
<p>And the kids who read that extra sentence</p>
<p>did significantly better in English a whole year later.</p>
<p>The only change was this one sentence.</p>
<p>What did the sentence say?</p>
<p>So what did the sentence say?</p>
<p>The sentence said, I&rsquo;m giving you this feedback</p>
<p>because I believe in you.</p>
<p>And the kids who read that did better a year later.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So when I share this with teachers,</p>
<p>I say, you know, I&rsquo;m not suggesting</p>
<p>you put on the bottom of all kids work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving this feedback because I believe in you.</p>
<p>One of the teachers said to me, we don&rsquo;t put it on a stamp.</p>
<p>I said, no, don&rsquo;t put it on a stamp.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, but your words are really important.</p>
<p>And kids are sitting in classrooms all the time thinking,</p>
<p>what does my teacher think of me?</p>
<p>Does my teacher think I can do this?</p>
<p>So it turns out it is really important</p>
<p>to be saying to kids, I know you can do this.</p>
<p>And those messages are not given enough by teachers.</p>
<p>And really believe it.</p>
<p>And believe it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say it, you have to believe it.</p>
<p>I sometimes, cause it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a funny dance,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m almost such a perfectionist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely self critical.</p>
<p>And I have one of the students come up to me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear to me that they&rsquo;re not even close to good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tempting for me to be like,</p>
<p>to sort of give up on them mentally.</p>
<p>But the reality is like,</p>
<p>if you look at many great people throughout history,</p>
<p>they sucked at some point.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And some of the greatest took nonlinear paths</p>
<p>to where they sucked for long into later life.</p>
<p>And so always kind of believing that this person</p>
<p>can be great.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You have to communicate that,</p>
<p>plus the fact that they have to work hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley where I live is filled with people</p>
<p>who are dropouts at school,</p>
<p>or who had special needs, who didn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting that have gone on</p>
<p>to do amazing work in creative ways.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think our school system is set up</p>
<p>to value good memorizers who can reproduce</p>
<p>what a teacher is showing them,</p>
<p>and push away those creative deep thinkers,</p>
<p>often slower thinkers, they think slowly and deeply.</p>
<p>And they often get the idea early on</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t be good at maths or other subjects.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think many of those people</p>
<p>are the ones who go on and do amazing things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy named Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>I know many mathematicians like this,</p>
<p>but he talks a lot about having a nonstandard way</p>
<p>of learning.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of great mathematicians,</p>
<p>a lot of great physicists are like that.</p>
<p>And he felt like he became quickly,</p>
<p>he got his PhD at Harvard,</p>
<p>became quickly an outcast of the system.</p>
<p>Like the education, especially early education system,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t help him.</p>
<p>Is there ways for an education system</p>
<p>to support people like that?</p>
<p>Is it this kind of multidimensional learning</p>
<p>that you mentioned?</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I think education system still uses an approach</p>
<p>that was in classrooms hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>The textbooks have a lot to answer for</p>
<p>in producing this very uninspiring mathematics.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you open up the subject</p>
<p>and have people see and solve it in different ways,</p>
<p>and value those different ways.</p>
<p>Somebody I appreciated a lot</p>
<p>is a mathematician called Mary Mizikani.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard of her.</p>
<p>She won the Fields Medal.</p>
<p>She was from Iran.</p>
<p>First woman in the world</p>
<p>to win the Fields Medal in mathematics.</p>
<p>She died when she was 40.</p>
<p>She was at Stanford.</p>
<p>But her work was entirely visual.</p>
<p>And she talked about how her daughter</p>
<p>thought she was an artist</p>
<p>because she was always visualizing.</p>
<p>And I attended,</p>
<p>she asked me to chair the PhD defense</p>
<p>for one of her students.</p>
<p>And I went to the defense in the math department.</p>
<p>And it was so interesting</p>
<p>because this young woman spent like two hours</p>
<p>sharing her work.</p>
<p>All of it was visual.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t think I saw any numbers at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And I remember that day thinking,</p>
<p>wow, I could have brought her like 13 year old</p>
<p>into this PhD defense.</p>
<p>They would not recognize this as maths.</p>
<p>But when Maryam Izzakhani won the Fields Medal,</p>
<p>all these other mathematicians were saying</p>
<p>that her work had connected</p>
<p>all these previously unconnected areas of maths.</p>
<p>And so, but when she was,</p>
<p>she also shared that when she was in school,</p>
<p>when she was about 13,</p>
<p>she was told that she couldn&rsquo;t do maths.</p>
<p>She was told that by her teacher.</p>
<p>Is this is Iran?</p>
<p>She grew up in Iran.</p>
<p>In Iran, yeah.</p>
<p>So I love that.</p>
<p>To be told you can&rsquo;t be good at maths</p>
<p>and then go on and win the Fields Medal is cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told by a lot of people in my life</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t do something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very, definitely nonstandard.</p>
<p>But all it takes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people talk about like the one teacher</p>
<p>that changed everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>All it takes is one teacher.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the power of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, that should be inspiring to teachers.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>You as a single person, given the education system,</p>
<p>given the incentives,</p>
<p>you have the power to truly change lives.</p>
<p>And like 20 years from now,</p>
<p>I feel as a medalist will walk up to you</p>
<p>and say thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you did that for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I share that with teachers</p>
<p>that even in this broken system</p>
<p>of what they have to do for districts and textbooks,</p>
<p>a single teacher can change kids maths relationship</p>
<p>or other subjects forever.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of the parents in this picture?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to another difficult subject.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a difficult subject.</p>
<p>One study found that</p>
<p>the amount of maths anxiety parents had</p>
<p>predicted their child&rsquo;s achievement in school,</p>
<p>but only if they helped with homework.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>There are some interesting implications for this.</p>
<p>I mean, you can see how it works.</p>
<p>If you have maths anxiety</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re helping your kids with homework,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably communicating things like,</p>
<p>oh, I was terrible at this at school.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it gets passed on to kids.</p>
<p>So one implication is</p>
<p>if you have a really bad relationship with maths,</p>
<p>you hate maths, you have maths anxiety,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t do maths homework with your kids.</p>
<p>But we have on our website,</p>
<p>we have a little sheet for parents</p>
<p>of ways to interact around maths with your kids and&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ucubed.org.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ucubed.org, yes.</p>
<p>So one of the things I say to parents</p>
<p>when I give parent presentations is</p>
<p>even if you hate maths,</p>
<p>you need to just fake it with your kids.</p>
<p>You should be always endlessly optimistic</p>
<p>and happy about doing maths.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always curious about this.</p>
<p>So I hope to have kids one day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have kids currently.</p>
<p>Are parents okay with like sucking at maths</p>
<p>and then trying to get their kid</p>
<p>to be better than them essentially?</p>
<p>Like, is that difficult thing for a lot of parents?</p>
<p>It is difficult.</p>
<p>To have like, it&rsquo;s almost like an ego thing.</p>
<p>Like, I never got good at this</p>
<p>and I probably should have.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, to me, you wanna celebrate that,</p>
<p>but I know a lot of people struggle with that.</p>
<p>Like coaches in sports,</p>
<p>to make an athlete become better than them,</p>
<p>it can be hard on the ego.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So do you experience the same with parents too?</p>
<p>I think, I mean, I haven&rsquo;t experienced parents</p>
<p>worrying that their kids will be better than them.</p>
<p>I have experienced&hellip;</p>
<p>I have experienced parents</p>
<p>just having a really bad relationship with maths</p>
<p>and not wanting to help,</p>
<p>not knowing how to help, saying things.</p>
<p>Like another study showed that when mothers</p>
<p>say to their daughters,</p>
<p>I was bad at maths in school,</p>
<p>their daughter&rsquo;s achievement goes down.</p>
<p>So we know that kids pick up on these messages</p>
<p>and which is why I say you should fake it.</p>
<p>But also I know that lots of people</p>
<p>have just had a really bad relationship with maths,</p>
<p>even successful people.</p>
<p>The undergrads I teach at Stanford</p>
<p>have pretty much always done well in maths,</p>
<p>but they come to Stanford thinking maths</p>
<p>is a set of methods to memorize.</p>
<p>And so, so do many parents believe that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one method that you memorize</p>
<p>and then you reproduce it.</p>
<p>So until people have really had an experience</p>
<p>of what I think of as the other maths,</p>
<p>well, until they&rsquo;ve really seen</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a really different subject,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for them to be able to shift their kids</p>
<p>to see it differently.</p>
<p>Is there for a teacher,</p>
<p>if we were to like systematize it,</p>
<p>is there something teachers can do</p>
<p>to do this more effectively?</p>
<p>So you mentioned the textbook.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what are the additional things</p>
<p>you can add on top of this whole old school</p>
<p>traditional way of teaching that can improve the process?</p>
<p>So I do think there&rsquo;s a way of teaching maths</p>
<p>that changes everything for kids and teachers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m one of five writers of a new framework</p>
<p>for the state of California, a new maths framework.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming out next year.</p>
<p>And we are recommending through this maths framework</p>
<p>that people teach in this way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called teaching to big ideas.</p>
<p>So at the moment, people have standards</p>
<p>that have been written,</p>
<p>and then textbooks have taken these standards</p>
<p>and made not very good questions.</p>
<p>And if you look at the standards,</p>
<p>like I have some written down here,</p>
<p>just reading the standards,</p>
<p>it makes maths seem really boring and uninspiring.</p>
<p>What are the kind of, can you give a few examples?</p>
<p>So this is an interesting example.</p>
<p>In third grade, there are three different standards</p>
<p>about unit squares.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is one of them.</p>
<p>A square with side length one unit, called a unit square,</p>
<p>is said to have one square unit of area</p>
<p>and can be used to measure area.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re expected to learn?</p>
<p>That is something, so that&rsquo;s a standard.</p>
<p>The textbook authors say,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m gonna make a question about that.</p>
<p>And they translate the standards into narrow questions.</p>
<p>And then you measure success by your ability</p>
<p>to deliver on these standards.</p>
<p>So the standards themselves, I think of maths</p>
<p>and many people think of maths in this way</p>
<p>as a subject of like a few big ideas</p>
<p>and really important connections between them.</p>
<p>So you could think of it as like a network map</p>
<p>of ideas and connections.</p>
<p>And what standards do is they take that beautiful map</p>
<p>and they chop it up like this into lots of little pieces</p>
<p>and they deliver the pieces to schools.</p>
<p>And so teachers don&rsquo;t see the connections between ideas,</p>
<p>nor do the kids.</p>
<p>So anyway, this is a bit of a long way of saying</p>
<p>that what we&rsquo;ve done in this new initiative</p>
<p>is we have set out maths as a set of big ideas</p>
<p>and connections between them.</p>
<p>So this is grade three.</p>
<p>So instead of there being 60 standards,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve said, well, you can pull these different standards</p>
<p>to get in with each other</p>
<p>and also value the ways these are connected.</p>
<p>And by the way, for people who are just listening,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at a small number of like big concepts</p>
<p>within mathematics, square towels,</p>
<p>measuring fraction, shape and time,</p>
<p>and then how they&rsquo;re interconnected.</p>
<p>And so the goal, this is for grade three, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so we&rsquo;ve set out for the state of California,</p>
<p>the whole of mathematics K10</p>
<p>as a set of big ideas and connections.</p>
<p>So we know that teachers, it works really well</p>
<p>if they say, okay, so a big idea in my grade is measuring.</p>
<p>And instead of reading five procedural statements</p>
<p>that involve measuring, they think,</p>
<p>okay, measuring is a big idea.</p>
<p>What rich, deep activity can I use</p>
<p>that teaches measuring to kids?</p>
<p>And as kids work on these deep, rich activities,</p>
<p>maybe over a few days,</p>
<p>turns out a lot of maths comes into it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re recommending that let&rsquo;s not teach maths</p>
<p>according to all these multiple statements</p>
<p>and lots and lots of short questions.</p>
<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s teach maths</p>
<p>by thinking about what are the big ideas</p>
<p>and what are really rich, deep activities</p>
<p>that teach those big ideas.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, like how you teach it</p>
<p>and maximize learning.</p>
<p>What about like from a school district perspective,</p>
<p>like measuring how well you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>grades and tests and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Do you throw those out or is it possible?</p>
<p>I am not a fan of grades and tests myself.</p>
<p>I think grades are fine</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re used at the end of a course.</p>
<p>So at the end of my maths course,</p>
<p>I might get a grade because a grade is meant</p>
<p>to be a summative measure.</p>
<p>It kind of describes your summative achievement.</p>
<p>But the problem we have in maths classrooms</p>
<p>across the US is people use grades all the time,</p>
<p>every week or every day even.</p>
<p>My own kids, when they went through high school,</p>
<p>technology has not helped with this.</p>
<p>When they went through high school,</p>
<p>they knew they were being graded</p>
<p>for everything they did, everything.</p>
<p>And not only were they being graded for everything,</p>
<p>but they could see it in the grade book online</p>
<p>and it would alter every class they went into.</p>
<p>So this is the ultimate,</p>
<p>what I think of as a performance culture.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re there to perform, somebody&rsquo;s measuring you,</p>
<p>you see your score.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s not conducive for deep learning.</p>
<p>And yes, have a grade at the end of the year,</p>
<p>but during the year,</p>
<p>you can assess kids in much better ways.</p>
<p>Like teachers can, a great way of assessing kids</p>
<p>is to give them a rubric that kind of outlines</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re learning over the course of a unit</p>
<p>or a few weeks.</p>
<p>So kids can actually see the journey they&rsquo;re on,</p>
<p>like this is what we&rsquo;re doing mathematically.</p>
<p>Sometimes they self assess on those units</p>
<p>and then teachers will show what the kids can do</p>
<p>with a rubric and also write notes.</p>
<p>Like in the next few weeks,</p>
<p>you might like to learn to do this.</p>
<p>So instead of kids just thinking about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an A kid or a B kid,</p>
<p>or I have this letter attached to me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually seeing mathematically what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re involved in the process</p>
<p>of knowing where they are mathematically.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, sure, they can have a grade,</p>
<p>but during the year,</p>
<p>they get these much more informative measures.</p>
<p>I do think this might be more for college,</p>
<p>but maybe not.</p>
<p>Some of the best classes I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>is when I got a special like set aside,</p>
<p>like the professor clearly saw that I was interested</p>
<p>in some aspect of a thing.</p>
<p>And then I have a few in mind and one in particular,</p>
<p>when he said that he kind of challenged me.</p>
<p>So this is outside of grades and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>that basically it&rsquo;s like reverse psychology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this can be done.</p>
<p>And so I gave everything to do that particular thing.</p>
<p>So this happened to be in an artificial intelligence class.</p>
<p>But I think that like special treatment</p>
<p>of taking students who are especially like excellent</p>
<p>at a particular little aspect,</p>
<p>that you see their eyes light up.</p>
<p>I often think like maybe it&rsquo;s tempting for a teacher</p>
<p>to think you&rsquo;ve already succeeded there,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually signaling to you</p>
<p>that like you could really launch them on their way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s too much to expect from teachers</p>
<p>I think to pay attention to all of that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>But I just kind of remember who are the biggest,</p>
<p>the most important people in the history</p>
<p>of my life of education.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s those people that who really didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>like inspire me with their awesomeness, which they did,</p>
<p>but also just they pushed me a little.</p>
<p>Like they gave me a little push.</p>
<p>And that requires focusing on the quote unquote</p>
<p>excellent students in the class.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think what&rsquo;s important though is teachers</p>
<p>to have the perspective that they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna be excellent at something</p>
<p>before they give out the activity.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And in our camp classes that we ran,</p>
<p>sometimes students would finish ahead of other students.</p>
<p>And we would say to them, can you write a question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like this but different?</p>
<p>Oh, and over time we encourage them</p>
<p>to like extend things further.</p>
<p>I remember we were doing one activity</p>
<p>where kids were working out the borders of a square</p>
<p>and how big this border would be in different case sizes.</p>
<p>And one of the boys came up at the end of the class</p>
<p>and said, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how you do this</p>
<p>to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>And I said, that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>How do you, what does it look like with Pentagon?</p>
<p>Go find out, see if you can discover.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know he was gonna come up and say that.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have in my head like this is the kid</p>
<p>who could have this extension task,</p>
<p>but you can still do that as a teacher.</p>
<p>When kids get excited about something</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re doing well in something,</p>
<p>have them extend it, go further.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And then you also, like this is like teacher and coach,</p>
<p>you could say it in different ways to different students.</p>
<p>Like for me, the right thing to say is almost to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you could do this, this is too hard.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what I need to hear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, no, there&rsquo;s immediate push.</p>
<p>But with some people, if they&rsquo;re a little bit more,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all has to do with upbringing,</p>
<p>how your genetics is.</p>
<p>They might be much more, that might break them.</p>
<p>Yeah, that might break them.</p>
<p>And so you have to be also sensitive to that.</p>
<p>I mean, teaching is really difficult for this very reason.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>So what is the best way to teach math,</p>
<p>to learn math at those early few days</p>
<p>when you just wanna capture them?</p>
<p>I do something, actually there&rsquo;s a video of me</p>
<p>doing this on our website that I love</p>
<p>when I first meet students.</p>
<p>And this is what I do.</p>
<p>I show them a picture, this is the picture I show them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a picture of seven dots like this.</p>
<p>And I show it for just a few seconds and I say to them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to tell me how many dots there are,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want you to count them.</p>
<p>I want you to group the dots.</p>
<p>And I show it them and then I take it away</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;ve even had enough time to count them.</p>
<p>And then I ask them, so how did you see it?</p>
<p>And I go around the room and amazingly enough,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably 18 different ways</p>
<p>of seeing these seven dots.</p>
<p>And so I ask people, tell me how you grouped it.</p>
<p>And some people see it as like an outside hole</p>
<p>with a center dot.</p>
<p>Some people see like stripes of lines.</p>
<p>Some people see segments.</p>
<p>And I collect them all and I put them on the board.</p>
<p>And at the end I say, look at this,</p>
<p>we are a class of 30 kids</p>
<p>and we saw these seven dots in 18 different ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a mathematical term for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called groupitizing.</p>
<p>Groupitizing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>So turns out though that how well you groupitize</p>
<p>predicts how well you do in maths.</p>
<p>Is it a raw talent or is it just something</p>
<p>that you can develop?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s raw.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re born groupitizing, I think,</p>
<p>but some kids have developed that ability if you like.</p>
<p>And you can learn it.</p>
<p>So this to me is part of how wrong we have maths.</p>
<p>That we think to tell whether a kid&rsquo;s good at maths,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna give them a speed test on multiples.</p>
<p>But actually seeing how kids group dots</p>
<p>could be a more important assessment</p>
<p>of how well they&rsquo;re gonna do in maths.</p>
<p>Anyway, I diverge.</p>
<p>What I like to do though when I start off with kids</p>
<p>is show them I&rsquo;m gonna give you maths problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna value the different ways you see them.</p>
<p>And it turns out you can do this kind of problem</p>
<p>asking people how they group dots with young children</p>
<p>or with graduate students.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s engaging for all of them.</p>
<p>You talk about creativity a little bit</p>
<p>and flexibility in your book Limitless.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of that?</p>
<p>So it sounds like there&rsquo;s a bit of that kind of thing</p>
<p>involved in groupitizing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I love this term.</p>
<p>So what would you say is the role of creativity</p>
<p>and flexibility in the learning of maths?</p>
<p>I think what we know now is that what we need</p>
<p>for this 21st century world we live in is a flexible mind.</p>
<p>School should not really be about teaching kids</p>
<p>particular methods but teaching them</p>
<p>to approach problems with flexibility.</p>
<p>Being creative, thinking creatively is really important.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t think the words maths and creativity</p>
<p>come together, but that&rsquo;s what I love about maths</p>
<p>is the creative different ways you can see it.</p>
<p>And so helping our kids, there&rsquo;s a book I like a lot</p>
<p>by physicists, you probably know this book called Elastic.</p>
<p>You might know it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about how we want elastic minds.</p>
<p>Same kind of thing, flexible, creative minds.</p>
<p>And schools do very little on developing that kind of mind.</p>
<p>They do a lot of developing the kind of mind</p>
<p>that a computer now does for us.</p>
<p>Memorization.</p>
<p>Memorization, doing procedures, a lot of things</p>
<p>that we spend a lot of time in school on.</p>
<p>In the world, when kids leave school,</p>
<p>a computer will do that and better than they will.</p>
<p>But that creative, flexible thinking,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of at ground zero at computers</p>
<p>being able to engage in that thinking.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re a little above ground zero,</p>
<p>but the human brain is perfectly suited</p>
<p>for that creative, flexible thinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what humans are so great at.</p>
<p>So I would like the balance to shift in schools.</p>
<p>Maybe you still need to do some procedural kind of thinking,</p>
<p>but there should be a lot more of that creative,</p>
<p>flexible thinking.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the role of other humans in this picture?</p>
<p>So collaborative learning, so brainstorming together.</p>
<p>So creativity as it emerges from the collective intelligence</p>
<p>of multiple humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, super important.</p>
<p>And we know that also helps develop your brain,</p>
<p>that social side of thinking.</p>
<p>And I love mathematics collaboration</p>
<p>where people build on each other&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>and they come up with amazing things.</p>
<p>I actually taught a hundred students calculus</p>
<p>at Stanford recently, undergrads,</p>
<p>and we taught them to collaborate.</p>
<p>So these students came in Stanford</p>
<p>and most of them were against collaboration in math.</p>
<p>This is before COVID in person?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was just before COVID hit.</p>
<p>It was 2019.</p>
<p>And this summer.</p>
<p>So you said they&rsquo;re against?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d only experienced maths individually</p>
<p>in a kind of competitive individual way.</p>
<p>And if they had experienced it as group work,</p>
<p>it had been a bad experience.</p>
<p>Like maybe they were the one who did it all</p>
<p>and the others didn&rsquo;t do much.</p>
<p>So they were kind of against collaboration.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t see any role for it in maths.</p>
<p>And we taught them to collaborate and it was hard work</p>
<p>because as well as the fact</p>
<p>that they were kind of against collaboration,</p>
<p>they came in with a lot of like social comparison thinking.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in this room with other Stanford undergrads</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re better than me or&hellip;</p>
<p>So when we set them to work on a maths problem together,</p>
<p>the first one was kind of a disaster</p>
<p>because they put all like, they&rsquo;re better than me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re faster than me.</p>
<p>They came up with something I didn&rsquo;t come up with.</p>
<p>So we taught them to let go of that thinking</p>
<p>and to work well together.</p>
<p>And one of the things we did, we decided</p>
<p>we wanted to do a pre and post test</p>
<p>at the end of this teaching.</p>
<p>It was only four weeks long, but we knew</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t want to give them like a time test</p>
<p>of individual work.</p>
<p>So we gave them an applied problem to do at the beginning</p>
<p>and we gave them to do in pairs together.</p>
<p>And we gave each of them a different colored pen</p>
<p>and said, work on this activity together</p>
<p>and keep using that pen.</p>
<p>So then we had all these pieces of student work.</p>
<p>And what we saw was they just worked</p>
<p>on separate parts of the paper.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little like red pen section</p>
<p>and a green pen section.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t do that well on it.</p>
<p>Even though it was a problem that middle</p>
<p>or high school kids could do,</p>
<p>but it was like a problem solving kind of problem.</p>
<p>And then we gave them the same one to do at the end,</p>
<p>gave them the same colors.</p>
<p>And actually they had learned to collaborate.</p>
<p>And not only were they collaborating the second time round,</p>
<p>but that boosted their achievement.</p>
<p>And the ones who collaborated did better on the problem.</p>
<p>Collaboration is important, having people,</p>
<p>and what was so eye opening for these undergrads</p>
<p>and they talked about it in lovely ways</p>
<p>was I learned to value other people&rsquo;s thinking on a problem.</p>
<p>And I learned to value that other people</p>
<p>saw it in different ways.</p>
<p>And it was quite a big experience for them</p>
<p>that they came out thinking,</p>
<p>I can do maths with other people.</p>
<p>People can see it differently.</p>
<p>We can build on each other&rsquo;s ways of thinking.</p>
<p>I got a chance to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who Daniel Kahneman is,</p>
<p>got a chance to interact with him.</p>
<p>And like the first,</p>
<p>cause he had a few,</p>
<p>but one famous collaboration throughout his life</p>
<p>with Tversky.</p>
<p>And just like, you know,</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t met me before in person,</p>
<p>but just the number of questions he was asking,</p>
<p>just the curiosity.</p>
<p>So I think one of the skills,</p>
<p>the collaboration itself is a skill.</p>
<p>And I remember my experience with him was like,</p>
<p>okay, I get why you&rsquo;re so good at collaboration</p>
<p>because he was just extremely good at listening</p>
<p>and genuine curiosity about how the other person</p>
<p>thinks about the world, sees the world.</p>
<p>And then together he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>he pulled me in in that particular case.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know in particular,</p>
<p>like that much about autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>but he kept like asking all of these questions.</p>
<p>And then like 10 minutes in,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re together trying to solve the problem</p>
<p>of autonomous driving.</p>
<p>And like, and that, I mean, that&rsquo;s really fulfilling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really enriching.</p>
<p>But it also in that moment made me realize</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a skill.</p>
<p>Cause you have to kind of put your ego aside,</p>
<p>put your view of the world aside</p>
<p>and try to learn how the other person sees it.</p>
<p>And the other thing you have to put aside</p>
<p>is this social comparison thinking.</p>
<p>Like if you are sitting there thinking,</p>
<p>wow, that was an amazing idea.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so much better than I am.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really gonna stop you taking on</p>
<p>the value of that idea.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of that going on</p>
<p>between these Stanford students when they came.</p>
<p>And trying to help them let go of that.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>just because being a little bit more in the public eye,</p>
<p>how rewarding it is to celebrate others.</p>
<p>And how much is going to actually pay off in the long term.</p>
<p>So this kind of silo thinking of like,</p>
<p>I want to prove to a small set of people around me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really smart and do so</p>
<p>by basically not celebrating</p>
<p>how smart the other people are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually maybe short term,</p>
<p>it seems like a good strategy, but long term it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And I think if you practice at the student level</p>
<p>and then at the career level, at every single stage,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s ultimately.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really good way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>You mentioned textbooks and you didn&rsquo;t say it,</p>
<p>maybe textbooks isn&rsquo;t the perfect way to teach mathematics,</p>
<p>but I love textbooks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like pretty pictures</p>
<p>and they smell nice and they open.</p>
<p>I mean, I talk about like physical.</p>
<p>Some of my greatest experiences have been just like,</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re really well done.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about basic, like high school,</p>
<p>calculus, biology, chemistry, those are like,</p>
<p>those are incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Wikipedia, but with color and a nice little.</p>
<p>You must&rsquo;ve seen some good textbooks</p>
<p>if they had pretty pictures and color.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I remember,</p>
<p>I guess it was very, very standard, like AP calculus,</p>
<p>AP biology, AP chemistry.</p>
<p>I felt those were like some of the happiest days of my life</p>
<p>in terms of learning was high school.</p>
<p>Cause it was very easy, honestly.</p>
<p>It felt hard at the time,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically doing a whirlwind tour</p>
<p>of all the science.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Without having to pick, you do literature,</p>
<p>you do like Shakespeare, calculus, biology, physics,</p>
<p>chemistry, what else?</p>
<p>Anatomy, physiology, computer science,</p>
<p>without like, nobody&rsquo;s telling you what to do with your life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just doing all of those things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I remember the textbooks weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing the past,</p>
<p>but I remember they weren&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re pretty good.</p>
<p>But so you think, what role do you think they play still?</p>
<p>And like in this more modern digital age,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best materials with which to do</p>
<p>these kinds of educations?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m intrigued that you had such a good experience</p>
<p>with textbooks.</p>
<p>I mean, I can remember loving some textbooks I had</p>
<p>when I was learning and I love books.</p>
<p>I love to pick up books and look through them,</p>
<p>but a lot of maths textbooks</p>
<p>are not good experiences for kids.</p>
<p>They, we have a video on our website</p>
<p>of the kids who came to our camp</p>
<p>and one of the students says,</p>
<p>in maths, you have to follow the textbook.</p>
<p>The textbook is kind of like the Bible.</p>
<p>You have to follow it.</p>
<p>And every day it&rsquo;s slightly different.</p>
<p>Like on Monday you do 2.3.2</p>
<p>and on Tuesday you do 2.3.3 and on Wednesday.</p>
<p>And you never go off that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like every single day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not inspiring for a lot of the kids.</p>
<p>So one of the things they loved about our camp</p>
<p>was just that there were no books.</p>
<p>Even though we gave them sheets of paper instead,</p>
<p>they still felt more free</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t just like trotting through exercises,</p>
<p>exercises, so.</p>
<p>Like what a textbook allows you is like you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the very thing you said they might not like,</p>
<p>the 2.3, 2.3, it feels like you&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>And like it&rsquo;s little celebrations</p>
<p>because you do the problem and it seems really hard</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know how to do it.</p>
<p>And then you try and try and then eventually succeed.</p>
<p>And then you make that little step and further progress.</p>
<p>And then you get to the end of a chapter</p>
<p>and you get to like, it&rsquo;s closure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, all right, I got that figured out.</p>
<p>And then you go on to the next chapter.</p>
<p>I can see that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it could be in a textbook.</p>
<p>You can have a good experience with a textbook,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s really important is what is in that textbook?</p>
<p>What are you doing inside it?</p>
<p>And I mean, I grew up in England</p>
<p>and in England we learn maths.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have this separation of algebra and geometry.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think any other country</p>
<p>apart from the US has that.</p>
<p>But I look at kids in algebra classes</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re doing algebra for a year.</p>
<p>And I think I would have been pretty bored doing that.</p>
<p>By the way, can we analyze your upbringing real quick?</p>
<p>Why do British folks call mathematics, maths?</p>
<p>Why is it the plural?</p>
<p>Is it because of everything you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a bunch of subdisciplines?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, mathematics is supposed to be</p>
<p>the different maths that you look at,</p>
<p>whether you think of that as topics</p>
<p>like geometry and probability,</p>
<p>or I think of it as maths is just multi dimensional</p>
<p>lots of ways, but that&rsquo;s why it was called mathematics.</p>
<p>And then it was shortened to maths.</p>
<p>And then for some reason it was just math in the US.</p>
<p>But to me, math has that more singular feel to it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an expression here, which is do the math,</p>
<p>which basically means do a calculation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people mean by do the math.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like that expression</p>
<p>because no math could be anything</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be calculation.</p>
<p>And so yeah, I like maths</p>
<p>because it has more of that broad feel to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p>Maths kind of emphasize the multi dimensional,</p>
<p>like a variety of different subdisciplines,</p>
<p>different approaches.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, but outside of the textbook,</p>
<p>what do you see like broadly being used?</p>
<p>You mentioned Sebastian Thrun and MOOCs,</p>
<p>online education.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s an effective set?</p>
<p>Can be.</p>
<p>I mean, online, having great teachers online,</p>
<p>obviously extends those teachers to many more people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>I have quite a few online courses myself.</p>
<p>I got the bug working with Sebastian</p>
<p>when he had released his first MOOC.</p>
<p>And I thought, maybe I could do one in maths education.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know if anybody would take it.</p>
<p>I remember releasing it that first summer</p>
<p>and it was a free online class</p>
<p>and 30,000 maths teachers took it that first summer.</p>
<p>And they were all talking about it with each other</p>
<p>and sharing it and it was like took off.</p>
<p>In fact, it was that MOOC that got me to create YouCubed</p>
<p>with Kathy Williams, who&rsquo;s the co founder,</p>
<p>because people took the MOOC and then they said,</p>
<p>okay, what now?</p>
<p>I finished, what can I have next?</p>
<p>And so that was where we made our website.</p>
<p>But so yeah, I think online education can be great.</p>
<p>I do think a lot of the MOOCs don&rsquo;t have great pedagogy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a talking head.</p>
<p>And you can actually engage people in more active ways,</p>
<p>even in online learning.</p>
<p>So I learned from the Udacity principle</p>
<p>when I was working at Udacity,</p>
<p>never to talk more than like five minutes.</p>
<p>And then to ask people to do something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the sort of pedagogy of the online classes I have</p>
<p>is a little bit of presenting something</p>
<p>and then people do something and there&rsquo;s a little bit more.</p>
<p>Because I think if you have a half hour video,</p>
<p>you just switch off and start doing other things.</p>
<p>So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute,</p>
<p>like bit of teaching with some visual stuff perhaps.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like a quiz almost.</p>
<p>Then you answer a question, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s really effective.</p>
<p>You mentioned Ucubed, so what&rsquo;s the mission?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal?</p>
<p>You mentioned how it started, but what&rsquo;s yeah,</p>
<p>where are you at now?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s your dream with it?</p>
<p>What are the kind of things that people should go</p>
<p>and check out?</p>
<p>Yeah, we started Ucubed, I guess it was about five years</p>
<p>ago now and we&rsquo;ve had over 52 million visitors to the site.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very happy about that.</p>
<p>And our goal is to share good ideas for teaching</p>
<p>with teachers, students, parents in maths and to help.</p>
<p>We have a sort of sub goal of a raising maths anxiety.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important to us, but also to share maths</p>
<p>as this beautiful creative subject.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been really great.</p>
<p>We have lessons on the site, but one of the reasons</p>
<p>I thought this was needed is there&rsquo;s a lot of knowledge</p>
<p>in the academy about how to teach maths well.</p>
<p>Loads and loads of research and journals</p>
<p>and lots of things written up, but teachers don&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have access to it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often behind pay walls, they&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>in really inaccessible ways.</p>
<p>So people wouldn&rsquo;t want to read them or understand them.</p>
<p>So this actually is a big problem.</p>
<p>You have this whole industry of people finding out</p>
<p>how to teach well, not sharing it with the people</p>
<p>who are teaching.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we made Ucubed.</p>
<p>And instead of just putting articles up saying,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some things to read about how to teach well,</p>
<p>we translated what was coming from research</p>
<p>into things that teacher could use.</p>
<p>So lessons, there were videos to show kids</p>
<p>and there were tips for parents.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of things on the site.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been amazing.</p>
<p>As we took inspiration from the week of code,</p>
<p>which got teachers to focus on coding for a week.</p>
<p>And we have this thing called the week</p>
<p>of inspirational maths.</p>
<p>And we say, just try it for a week.</p>
<p>Just give us one week and try it and see what happens.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been downloaded millions of times.</p>
<p>Teachers use it every year.</p>
<p>They start the school year with it.</p>
<p>And what they tell us is it was amazing.</p>
<p>The kids lights were on, they were excited, they loved it.</p>
<p>And then the week finished and I opened my textbooks</p>
<p>and the lights went out and they were not interested.</p>
<p>Yeah, but getting that first inspiration is still powerful.</p>
<p>It is, I wish, I mean, what I would love</p>
<p>is if we could actually extend that for the whole year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a small team at Stanford</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to keep up with great things</p>
<p>to put on the site.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t the capacity to produce</p>
<p>these creative visual maths tasks</p>
<p>for every year group for every day,</p>
<p>but I would love to do that.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to do?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s to come up with visual formulations</p>
<p>of these big important topics you need to think about</p>
<p>in a way that you could teach.</p>
<p>I mean, we can do it.</p>
<p>We actually, we went from the week of inspirational maths</p>
<p>and we made K8 maths books with exactly that.</p>
<p>Big ideas, rich activities, visuals.</p>
<p>We just finished the last one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing it for five years</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been exhausting and we just finished.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s a whole K8 set of books</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re organized in that way.</p>
<p>These are the big ideas.</p>
<p>Here are rich, deep activities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not though what you can do every day for a year.</p>
<p>So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement</p>
<p>to their boring textbook.</p>
<p>And some people have said, okay, this is the year.</p>
<p>This book tells us what the year is</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll supplement these big activities with.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re being used and teachers really like them</p>
<p>and are really happy about them.</p>
<p>I just always want more.</p>
<p>And I guess one of the things I would like for YouCubed,</p>
<p>one of my personal goals is that every teacher of maths</p>
<p>knows about YouCubed.</p>
<p>At the moment, lots of teachers who come to us</p>
<p>are really happy they found it</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of other teachers</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know that it exists.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From a student perspective and not in the classroom</p>
<p>but at home studying,</p>
<p>is there some advice you can give</p>
<p>on how to best study mathematics?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the role of the student outside the classroom?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think one thing we know is a lot of people</p>
<p>when they review material,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s maths or anything else,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do it in the best way.</p>
<p>I think a problem a lot of people have</p>
<p>is they read through maybe a teacher&rsquo;s explanation</p>
<p>or a way of doing maths and it makes sense.</p>
<p>And they think, oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve got that.</p>
<p>And they move on.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s not until you come to try</p>
<p>and work on something and do a problem</p>
<p>that you actually realize you didn&rsquo;t really understand it,</p>
<p>just seemed to make sense.</p>
<p>So I would say,</p>
<p>this is also something that neuroscientists talk about,</p>
<p>to keep giving yourself questions</p>
<p>is a really good way to study.</p>
<p>Rather than looking through lots of material,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like giving yourself lots of tests</p>
<p>is a good way to actually deeply understand things</p>
<p>and know what you do and you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So would the questions be in the form of</p>
<p>the material you&rsquo;re reviewing</p>
<p>is the answer to that question?</p>
<p>Or is it almost like beyond,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the polygon thing they mentioned for a square.</p>
<p>Is it almost like, I wonder what is the bigger picture?</p>
<p>I was kind of asking like, how is this extended and so on?</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a similar,</p>
<p>I mean, a question I get asked a lot is about homework.</p>
<p>What is a good thing for kids to do for homework?</p>
<p>And one of the recommendations I give</p>
<p>is to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework,</p>
<p>but to actually ask them to reflect on what they&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>Like, what was the big idea you learned today?</p>
<p>Or what did you find difficult?</p>
<p>What did you struggle with?</p>
<p>What was something that was exciting?</p>
<p>Then kids go home and they have to kind of reflect</p>
<p>in a deeper way.</p>
<p>A lot of times, I don&rsquo;t know if you had this experience</p>
<p>as a math student, lots of people do.</p>
<p>Kids are going through math questions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re successful, they get them right,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t even really know what they&rsquo;re about.</p>
<p>And a lot of kids go through many years of maths like that,</p>
<p>doing lots of questions,</p>
<p>but that really knowing what even the topic is</p>
<p>or what it&rsquo;s about, what it&rsquo;s important for.</p>
<p>So having students go back and think at the end of a day,</p>
<p>what was the big idea from this maths lesson?</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Where would I find that in real life?</p>
<p>Those are really good questions</p>
<p>for kids to be thinking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably for everybody to be thinking about.</p>
<p>I think most of us go through life</p>
<p>never asking the bigger question,</p>
<p>always those layers of why questions</p>
<p>that kids ask when they&rsquo;re very young.</p>
<p>We need to keep doing that.</p>
<p>Like whatever the term is,</p>
<p>you call first principles thinking,</p>
<p>some people call it that,</p>
<p>which is like, why are we doing it this way?</p>
<p>So one nice thing is to do that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s usually a good answer.</p>
<p>The reason we did it this way</p>
<p>is because it works for this reason.</p>
<p>But then if you want to do something totally novel,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll say, well, we&rsquo;ve been doing it this way</p>
<p>because of historical reasons,</p>
<p>but really this is not the best way to do it.</p>
<p>There might be other ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how invention happens.</p>
<p>And then you get, that&rsquo;s really useful</p>
<p>in every aspect of life, like choosing your career,</p>
<p>choosing your, I don&rsquo;t know, where you live,</p>
<p>who your romantic partner is, like everything.</p>
<p>Everything, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think it probably starts doing that in math class.</p>
<p>That would be good if we started doing that.</p>
<p>I mean, I wonder, I probably didn&rsquo;t do very much of that</p>
<p>for most of my education, asking why,</p>
<p>except for later, much later in the subjects</p>
<p>on grad school when you&rsquo;re doing research on them.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re first tasked with doing something novel</p>
<p>using this or solving a problem</p>
<p>really outside the classroom,</p>
<p>they have to publish on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time you think,</p>
<p>wait, why are these things interesting, useful?</p>
<p>Which are the things that are useful?</p>
<p>And yeah, I guess that would be nice</p>
<p>if we did that much earlier, the quest of invention.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I mean, one of the sad pieces of research data</p>
<p>I think about is the questions kids ask in school goes down</p>
<p>like in a linear progression from, in the early years,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stop kids asking those questions,</p>
<p>but they learn not to ask the questions.</p>
<p>I think you told somewhere about an early memory</p>
<p>you had in your own education where you asked the question,</p>
<p>or maybe that was an example you gave,</p>
<p>but it was shut down.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve listened to something I said, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember where it was, but it caught me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember it really vividly.</p>
<p>Or can you tell the memory?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was, it&rsquo;s funny, I can remember.</p>
<p>It must&rsquo;ve really impacted me in that moment</p>
<p>because you know how there&rsquo;s lots of hours of school</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t remember at all, but anyway,</p>
<p>I can remember where I was sitting and everything.</p>
<p>I was in a high school maths class,</p>
<p>although they don&rsquo;t call it that in England,</p>
<p>and the teacher said,</p>
<p>and it was like the first class of this teacher&rsquo;s class,</p>
<p>and he said, ask if you have any questions.</p>
<p>So at one point I put my hand up and I said,</p>
<p>I have a question, and he said something like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your question?</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking any more questions in this class.</p>
<p>And that hit hard in a way where you didn&rsquo;t wanna,</p>
<p>the lesson you learn from that is I&rsquo;m not gonna ask.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was absolutely the last question I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department.</p>
<p>I remember that really well.</p>
<p>So maybe because of that experience,</p>
<p>one of the things we encourage when we teach kids</p>
<p>is asking questions, and we value it when they ask questions</p>
<p>and we put them up on walls and celebrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because I wish there was a feedback signal</p>
<p>because he probably, to put a positive spin on it,</p>
<p>he probably didn&rsquo;t realize the negative impact</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had in that moment, right?</p>
<p>If he only knew, see, this is probably</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re more mature in grad school.</p>
<p>I had an amazing professor named Ali Shakafande</p>
<p>in computer science, and he would get,</p>
<p>he would encourage questions,</p>
<p>but then he would tell everybody</p>
<p>how dumb their questions are.</p>
<p>But it was done, I guess if you show,</p>
<p>if you say it with love and respect behind it,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s more like a friendly, humorous encouragement</p>
<p>for more questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an art, right, to do it, to write.</p>
<p>And then you have to time it right</p>
<p>because that kind of humor is probably better</p>
<p>for when you&rsquo;re in grad school</p>
<p>versus when you&rsquo;re in the early education.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, and I guess kids or young people get</p>
<p>whether somebody&rsquo;s doing it to be funny or, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, this is why teaching is so hard.</p>
<p>Even your tone can be impactful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad because for that particular human,</p>
<p>the teacher, you just had a bad day,</p>
<p>and one statement can have a profound negative impact.</p>
<p>I know, sadly, that there&rsquo;s a lot of maths teachers</p>
<p>who have that kind of approach,</p>
<p>and I think they&rsquo;re suffering from the fact</p>
<p>that they think people are math people, not math people,</p>
<p>and that comes across in their teaching.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, one positive statement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Keep them going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That is the flip side of that.</p>
<p>And I myself had one teacher who was really amazing</p>
<p>for me in maths, and she kept me in the subject.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have left it.</p>
<p>Who was she?</p>
<p>She was, her name was Mrs. Marshall.</p>
<p>And she was my A level maths teacher.</p>
<p>So I was in England.</p>
<p>You do lots of subjects till you&rsquo;re 16,</p>
<p>and then you choose like three or four subjects.</p>
<p>So I had chosen maths, and you go to higher levels,</p>
<p>probably equivalent more to a master&rsquo;s degree in the US</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re more specialized.</p>
<p>But anyways, she was my teacher,</p>
<p>and for the first time in my whole career in maths,</p>
<p>she would give us problems</p>
<p>and tell us to talk about them with each other.</p>
<p>And so here I was sitting there at like 17,</p>
<p>talking with friends about how to solve a math problem,</p>
<p>and that was it.</p>
<p>That was the change that she made,</p>
<p>but it was profound for me</p>
<p>because like those calculus students,</p>
<p>I started to hear other people&rsquo;s ways of thinking</p>
<p>and seeing it, and we would talk together</p>
<p>and come up with solutions.</p>
<p>And I was like, that was it.</p>
<p>That changed maths for me.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t some kind of personal interaction with her.</p>
<p>It was more like she was the catalyst</p>
<p>for that collaborative experience.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes it&rsquo;s a personal message,</p>
<p>but it can be your teaching approach</p>
<p>that changes maths for kids.</p>
<p>You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called Deep Work,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist,</p>
<p>and he talks about the kind of the focus required</p>
<p>to do that kind of work.</p>
<p>Is there something you can comment on?</p>
<p>You know, we live in a world full of distractions.</p>
<p>That seems like one of the elements that makes studying,</p>
<p>and especially the studying of subjects</p>
<p>that require thinking like maths does, difficult.</p>
<p>Is there something from a student perspective,</p>
<p>from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work</p>
<p>that you can comment on?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems,</p>
<p>and we have some on our website,</p>
<p>is a really important experience for them.</p>
<p>Even if they only do it occasionally,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>They actually realise, I do, I give a problem out often</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m working with teachers, and I say to them,</p>
<p>all right, I&rsquo;m gonna check in with you after an hour.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, an hour?</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>And then they work on this problem,</p>
<p>and after an hour, I say, okay, how are we doing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, an hour&rsquo;s gone by?</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>And so everybody needs those like rich deep problems.</p>
<p>Most kids go through their whole maths experience</p>
<p>of however many years, never once working on a problem</p>
<p>in that kind of deep way.</p>
<p>So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that.</p>
<p>We work on these deep problems every session.</p>
<p>And the students come away going, okay,</p>
<p>I never wanna go back to that maths relationship I had</p>
<p>where it was just all about quick answers.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t wanna go back to that.</p>
<p>And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate</p>
<p>those problems in their classrooms.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t do them every day,</p>
<p>but they at least give kids some experience</p>
<p>of being able to work slowly and deeply</p>
<p>and to go to deeper places and not be told</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got five minutes to finish 20 questions.</p>
<p>Well, part of it is also just the exercise</p>
<p>of sitting there and maintaining focus</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not often, I mean, that&rsquo;s a skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a skill that also could be discouraging.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t practice it,</p>
<p>just sitting down for 10 minutes straight</p>
<p>and maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re really thinking about a problem</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s really important to realize</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a skill that you can just like a muscle,</p>
<p>you can build, you can start with five minutes</p>
<p>and goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour.</p>
<p>And to be successful, I think in certain subjects</p>
<p>like mathematics, you wanna be able to develop that skill.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;re not going to get</p>
<p>to the really rewarding experience</p>
<p>of solving these problems.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>There was a survey done of kids in school</p>
<p>where they were asked, how long will you work</p>
<p>on a maths problem before you give up</p>
<p>and decide it&rsquo;s not possible to solve it?</p>
<p>And the result on average across the kids was two minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a bad sign, but that was a powerful sign</p>
<p>that they need to learn to not give up so quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, we mentioned offline</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been talking so much about visualization,</p>
<p>Grant Sanderson, Three Blue One Brown.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s inspired millions of people</p>
<p>with exactly the kind of way of thinking</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love his work.</p>
<p>Converting sort of mathematical concepts</p>
<p>into visual, like visually representing them,</p>
<p>exploring them in ways that help you illuminate</p>
<p>like the concepts.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of that?</p>
<p>So he uses mostly programmatic visualization.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the thing I mentioned where there&rsquo;s like animations</p>
<p>created by writing computer programs.</p>
<p>Like what do you think, how scalable is that approach?</p>
<p>But in general, what do you think about his approach?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I should work with him.</p>
<p>I can share some of our visuals</p>
<p>and he can make them in that amazing way.</p>
<p>So part of his storytelling,</p>
<p>part of it is creating the visuals</p>
<p>and then weaving a story with those visuals</p>
<p>that kind of builds, like there&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s also drama in it.</p>
<p>You start with a small example</p>
<p>and then you kind of, all of a sudden there&rsquo;s a surprise.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And it really, I mean, it makes you fall in love</p>
<p>with the concept.</p>
<p>He does talk about that.</p>
<p>His sense is like some of the stuff,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t feel like he&rsquo;s teaching like the core curriculum,</p>
<p>which is something, he sees himself</p>
<p>as an inspirational figure.</p>
<p>But because I think it&rsquo;s too difficult</p>
<p>to kind of convert all of the curriculum into those elements.</p>
<p>And probably you don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>I mean, if people get to experience mathematical ideas</p>
<p>in the way that he shares them, that will change them.</p>
<p>And it will change the way they think.</p>
<p>And maybe they could go on</p>
<p>to take some other mathematical idea</p>
<p>and make it that beautiful.</p>
<p>Well, he does that.</p>
<p>He created a library called Manim and he open sourced it.</p>
<p>And that library is the, people should check it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written in Python</p>
<p>and it uses some of those same elements.</p>
<p>Like it allows you to animate equations</p>
<p>and animate little shapes.</p>
<p>Like people that, you know,</p>
<p>he has a very distinct style in his videos</p>
<p>and what that resulted in,</p>
<p>even though from a software engineer perspective,</p>
<p>the code he released is not like super well documented</p>
<p>or perfect, but him releasing that,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s all of these people educating it.</p>
<p>And the cool, to me personally,</p>
<p>the coolest thing is to see like people they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t have like a million subscribers</p>
<p>or something is they have just a few views in the video,</p>
<p>but it just seems like the process of them</p>
<p>creating a video where they teach</p>
<p>is like transformative to them from a student perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the old Feynman thing,</p>
<p>the best way to learn is to teach.</p>
<p>And then him releasing that into the wild is,</p>
<p>it shows that that impact.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think just giving people that idea</p>
<p>that you can do that with maths and other subjects,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bound to be people all around</p>
<p>who can create more, which is cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>So I recommend that people do like JavaScript or Python.</p>
<p>You can build like visualizations of most concepts</p>
<p>in high school math.</p>
<p>You can do a lot of kinds of visualizations</p>
<p>and doing that yourself.</p>
<p>Plus, if you do that yourself, people will really love it.</p>
<p>People actually, people love visualizations of math.</p>
<p>Cause they, I mean, it&rsquo;s something in us</p>
<p>that loves patterns, loves figuring out difficult things</p>
<p>and the patterns in there then are unexpected in some way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that hotels</p>
<p>are always filled with patterns?</p>
<p>I was just noticing at the hotel I&rsquo;m in now,</p>
<p>all of their carpets are pattern carpets</p>
<p>and then they have patterns on the walls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>We humans love the symmetry and patterns,</p>
<p>the breaking of symmetry and patterns.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s funny that we don&rsquo;t see mathematics</p>
<p>as somehow intricately connected to that, but it is, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the perspectives</p>
<p>that I love students to take is to be a pattern seeker.</p>
<p>In everything.</p>
<p>In, yeah, certainly in all of maths.</p>
<p>I mean, you can think of all of maths</p>
<p>as a kind of subject of patterns</p>
<p>and not just visual patterns, but, you know,</p>
<p>when you think about multiplying by five</p>
<p>and the fact you can, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re multiplying 18 times five,</p>
<p>you can instead think of nine times 10.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pattern that always works in mathematics.</p>
<p>You can halve a number and double a number.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I just think there are patterns everywhere.</p>
<p>And if kids are thinking their role is to see patterns</p>
<p>and find patterns, it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>What do you think about like MIT OpenCourseWare</p>
<p>and the release of lectures by universities?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I think that is what started the MOOC I did</p>
<p>was using that platform.</p>
<p>So you ultimately think like the Udacity models</p>
<p>is a little bit more effective</p>
<p>than just a plain two hour lecture.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s definitely,</p>
<p>you can bring in good pedagogy into online learning.</p>
<p>And I think the idea of putting things online</p>
<p>so that people all over the world can access them is great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the initial excitement around MOOCs</p>
<p>sort of democratizing education</p>
<p>and make it more equal came about</p>
<p>because they found that the people taking MOOCs</p>
<p>tended to be the more privileged people.</p>
<p>So that was, I think there&rsquo;s still something to be found</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s still more to be done</p>
<p>to help that online learning reach those principles.</p>
<p>But definitely, I think it&rsquo;s a good invention.</p>
<p>And I have an online class that&rsquo;s for kids,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little free class that gives them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the topic?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called How to Learn Maths.</p>
<p>How to Learn Maths.</p>
<p>It shows maths as this visual creative subject</p>
<p>and it shares mindset and some brain science</p>
<p>and kids who take it do better in maths class.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve studied it with like randomized controlled trials</p>
<p>and given it to middle school kids</p>
<p>and other middle school kids who don&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>but are taught by the same teachers.</p>
<p>So their teachers are the same.</p>
<p>And the kids who take the online class</p>
<p>end up 68% more engaged in their maths class</p>
<p>and do better at the end of the year.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little six session, 15 minute class</p>
<p>and it changes kids maths relationships.</p>
<p>So it is true that we can do that with some words</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not a huge change to the education system.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about mathematics quite a bit</p>
<p>but in terms of their journey through education,</p>
<p>through their career choices, through life,</p>
<p>maybe middle school, high school, undergrad students,</p>
<p>of how to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I think if I were to give advice to people,</p>
<p>especially young people, my advice would be to always,</p>
<p>it sounds really corny,</p>
<p>but always believe in yourself</p>
<p>and know that you can achieve</p>
<p>because although that sounds like obvious,</p>
<p>of course we want kids to know that they can achieve things.</p>
<p>I know that millions of kids who are in the school system</p>
<p>have been given the message, they cannot do things.</p>
<p>And adults too, they have the idea,</p>
<p>oh, I did okay in this, I went into this job</p>
<p>because those other things I could never have done okay in.</p>
<p>So actually when they hear,</p>
<p>hey, maybe you could do those other things.</p>
<p>Even adults think, maybe I can.</p>
<p>And they go back and they encounter this knowledge</p>
<p>and they relearn things and they change careers</p>
<p>and amazing things happen.</p>
<p>So for me, I think that message is really important.</p>
<p>You can learn anything.</p>
<p>Scientists try and find a limit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always trying to find a limit,</p>
<p>like how much can you really learn?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the limit to how much you can learn?</p>
<p>And they always come away not being able to find it.</p>
<p>People can just go further and further and further.</p>
<p>And that is true of people born with brain,</p>
<p>areas of their brain that aren&rsquo;t functioning well</p>
<p>that have what we call special needs.</p>
<p>Some of those people also go on to develop</p>
<p>and do amazing things.</p>
<p>So I think that really experiencing that,</p>
<p>knowing that feeling, not just saying it,</p>
<p>but knowing it deeply, you can learn anything</p>
<p>is something I wish all people would have.</p>
<p>Actually also applies when you&rsquo;ve achieved</p>
<p>some level of success too.</p>
<p>What I find, like in my life with people that love me,</p>
<p>when you achieve success,</p>
<p>they keep celebrating your success</p>
<p>and they want you to keep doing the thing</p>
<p>that you were successful at,</p>
<p>as opposed to believing in that you can do something else,</p>
<p>something big, whatever your heart says to do.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I realized the value of this,</p>
<p>quite recently, which is sad to say,</p>
<p>is how important it is to seek out,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re younger, to seek out mentors,</p>
<p>to seek out the people,</p>
<p>surround yourself with people that will believe in you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little bit is on you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t get that sometimes</p>
<p>if you go to grad school,</p>
<p>you think you kind of land on a mentor,</p>
<p>maybe you pick a mentor based on the topic</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>But the reality is the people you surround yourself with,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to define your life trajectory.</p>
<p>So select people that believe in you.</p>
<p>And get away from people who don&rsquo;t believe in you.</p>
<p>Sometimes parents can be that, they can love you deeply,</p>
<p>but they set, it&rsquo;s the math thing we mentioned,</p>
<p>they might set certain constraints on the beliefs</p>
<p>that you have.</p>
<p>And so in that, if you&rsquo;re interested in mathematics,</p>
<p>and your parents are not that interested in it,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t listen to your parents on that one dimension.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if people tell you you can&rsquo;t do things,</p>
<p>you have to hear from other people who believe in you.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right about that.</p>
<p>So sad the number of people who&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>those negative messages from parents.</p>
<p>In my Limitless Mind book, I interviewed quite a few people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been told they couldn&rsquo;t do math,</p>
<p>sometimes by parents, sometimes by teachers.</p>
<p>And fortunately, they had got other ideas</p>
<p>at some point in their life,</p>
<p>and realized there was this whole world</p>
<p>of mathematical thinking that was open to them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really important that people do connect</p>
<p>with people who believe in them,</p>
<p>however hard that might be to find those people.</p>
<p>What do you hope the education system,</p>
<p>education in general, looks like 10, 20, 50,</p>
<p>100 years from now?</p>
<p>Are you optimistic about this future?</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely have hope.</p>
<p>There is, change can happen in the education system.</p>
<p>In recent years, it&rsquo;s been microscopically slow.</p>
<p>But I do actually see change happening.</p>
<p>We were talking earlier that data science is now</p>
<p>a course you can take in high school instead of algebra two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty amazing because that content</p>
<p>was set out in 1892 and hasn&rsquo;t changed since then.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re actually seeing a change</p>
<p>in the content of high school.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m amazed that that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>and very happy it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So change is very slow in education usually,</p>
<p>but when you look ahead and think about all that we know,</p>
<p>and all that we can offer kids in terms of technology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to think that 100 years from now,</p>
<p>education will be totally different to the way it is now.</p>
<p>Maybe we won&rsquo;t have subject boundaries anymore</p>
<p>because those don&rsquo;t really make much sense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to think how certain tools</p>
<p>like programming, maybe they&rsquo;ll be deeply integrated</p>
<p>in everything we do.</p>
<p>Yeah, you would think that all kids are growing up</p>
<p>learning to program and create.</p>
<p>So I just think, I mean, the system of schooling</p>
<p>we have now, people call it a factory model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not designed to inspire creativity.</p>
<p>And I feel like that will also change.</p>
<p>People might look back on these days</p>
<p>and think they were hilarious,</p>
<p>but maybe we&rsquo;ll in the future,</p>
<p>kids will be doing their own programming</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be able to learn things</p>
<p>and find out things and create things</p>
<p>even as they&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>And maybe the individual subject boundaries will go.</p>
<p>Data science itself coming into the education system</p>
<p>kind of illustrates that because people realize</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really fit inside any of the subjects.</p>
<p>So what do we do with it?</p>
<p>Where does it go and who teaches it?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s already raising those kind of questions</p>
<p>and questioning how we have these different subject boundaries.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve seen data science be integrated</p>
<p>into the curriculum?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s happening across the United States as we speak.</p>
<p>I wonder how they got initiated.</p>
<p>Like how does change happen in the education system?</p>
<p>Is it just a few revolutionary leaders?</p>
<p>It does, I think so.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting journey</p>
<p>seeing data science take off actually.</p>
<p>There was a course that was developed in 2014</p>
<p>by some people who thought data science</p>
<p>was a good idea for high schoolers.</p>
<p>And then after some kids took the course</p>
<p>and nothing bad happened to them,</p>
<p>they went to college and people started to accept it more.</p>
<p>And then this was a big piece of the change in California.</p>
<p>The UC system communicated.</p>
<p>They sent out an email last year,</p>
<p>the 50,000 high schools saying, we now accept data science.</p>
<p>Kids can take it instead of algebra two.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfectly legitimate college pathway.</p>
<p>So that was like a big green light for a lot of schools</p>
<p>who were like wondering about whether they could teach it.</p>
<p>So I think it happens in small spaces and expands.</p>
<p>It goes viral.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In this modern age.</p>
<p>Then it goes viral.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s ahead, I think in creating courses</p>
<p>and having kids go through it, but it&rsquo;s suddenly,</p>
<p>when I last looked, there were 12 states</p>
<p>that were allowing data science as a high school course.</p>
<p>And I think by next year, that will have doubled or more.</p>
<p>So change is happening.</p>
<p>Joe, as I said, I think mathematics</p>
<p>is truly a beautiful subject.</p>
<p>And you having an impact on millions of people</p>
<p>and you having an impact on millions of people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>by educating them, by inspiring teachers to educate</p>
<p>in the ways that you&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in multidimensional ways, in visual ways,</p>
<p>I think is incredible.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re spreading beauty into the world.</p>
<p>So I really, really appreciate</p>
<p>that you spend your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It was really good to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Boller.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>Pure mathematics is the poetry of logical ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
