    <p>Hi friends, this week I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to stop hate in your body, because I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always look like this, I was not always this confident, and I used to hate the fuck out</p>
<p>of my body.</p>
<p>So I have a lot to break down, a lot of things to tell you, and you know I always give it</p>
<p>to you straight, and I give you new perspectives, and sometimes they hurt your fucking feelings,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to navigate it after I hurt your feelings, okay?</p>
<p>But really this is a big topic.</p>
<p>This is something I really want to do justice, and this video has the potential to change</p>
<p>your fucking life and change your relationship with your body.</p>
<p>This is everything that I&rsquo;ve fucking learned, and everything I wish I knew sooner.</p>
<p>So with your body, there are things that you can change, and things that you can&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Like no shit.</p>
<p>There are certain things you can change, like plastic surgery, losing weight, gaining weight,</p>
<p>putting on muscle.</p>
<p>Then there are certain things you can&rsquo;t change, like having a missing limb, having a missing</p>
<p>finger.</p>
<p>Your bone structure, your height, there are certain shit you just cannot change.</p>
<p>No surgery in the world is going to bring your fucking hand back, and no surgery in</p>
<p>the world is going to shave your hip bones down so you aren&rsquo;t shaped the way that you</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>There are certain things you just have to accept, and I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to</p>
<p>learn to accept them.</p>
<p>And my little example is going to have to get a little bit spiritual, but this is the</p>
<p>only explanation that I&rsquo;ve ever found, and the only perspective I&rsquo;ve ever found that</p>
<p>has allowed me to accept my body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really easy to accept your body when you look good.</p>
<p>Like I had to learn to accept my body when I was not looking like this.</p>
<p>I was like fat and ugly, and like my face was fucked up, and like my hair was not cute.</p>
<p>Like I had to learn to accept myself before it got good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to accept your body when you like it, but I was in a place where I didn&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>like it.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to get there, because you don&rsquo;t have to accept your body the way it</p>
<p>fucking is.</p>
<p>To stop hating it, you don&rsquo;t have to accept it and like it right now, but we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get there in a minute.</p>
<p>But my little kind of like spiritual nugget with accepting your body.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t know if everyone believes that we have a soul or not, but I believe we do.</p>
<p>Some kind of like soul, spirit, energy.</p>
<p>If you believe in energy, you&rsquo;ve got to believe in a soul, bitch.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something operating you that&rsquo;s more than just your body and your mind.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t want to fight about that.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe in that, just hear out the perspective, because it will bring you</p>
<p>a lot of comfort.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what you believe.</p>
<p>So my opinion on life and my kind of belief system is your soul chooses the life it comes</p>
<p>into.</p>
<p>So it chooses the body it comes into.</p>
<p>It chooses the sexuality it&rsquo;s going to have.</p>
<p>It chooses your parents.</p>
<p>It chooses the set of experiences that could potentially happen.</p>
<p>So with that, I look at it like it was my soul&rsquo;s choice to choose the body it chose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that mad at it anymore, but I used to be real fucking mad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why did you choose this one?</p>
<p>But now that I&rsquo;ve like fixed it, I feel better.</p>
<p>But with taking on the outlook that your soul chose the body it came into for a reason kind</p>
<p>of relieves you have a lot of pressure because if your soul chose it, it wanted it.</p>
<p>Your soul wanted the body you have because of what you were going to experience because</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people that are born with one arm or one leg.</p>
<p>Your soul wanted the expansion and wanted the insight and the awareness and the progression</p>
<p>it was going to get from coming into a life and operating in a life with that vehicle.</p>
<p>I look at my body as a vehicle and I&rsquo;m like, my soul chose this little vehicle to go run</p>
<p>around earth in because of what it was going to learn.</p>
<p>For my soul to choose to come in as a six foot seven motherfucker that looks like me,</p>
<p>acts like me, and is gay, plot twist, bitch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole set of expansion and a whole set of fucking circumstances that is not typical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of progression because of that dynamic.</p>
<p>People that are short, like if you&rsquo;re a short man, if you&rsquo;re five foot four as a dude, your</p>
<p>soul chose that.</p>
<p>It wanted that because of what you were going to experience because of it.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s kind of out there a little bit, but that&rsquo;s truly what I believe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s ever made sense in my mind or brought me any sort of comfort.</p>
<p>Understanding it was my soul&rsquo;s choice gets you kind of square in the reality of like,</p>
<p>this was chosen, so it gives you this sense of curiosity.</p>
<p>You switch from a place of hating your body and nitpicking it and wanting it to be different</p>
<p>to trying to explore the reasons why you have the body you have and what you&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>because of it and what you&rsquo;re experiencing because of it, how it&rsquo;s leading to your expansion.</p>
<p>That goes for skin color too because if I was black, I would have a whole different</p>
<p>set of life experiences than if I chose everything I did, but as white or Albanian.</p>
<p>I look white.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like white passing.</p>
<p>This is the way I like to look at life because like I said, it makes you curious and you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t focus at yourself with an attitude of like hatred and disgust and judgment while</p>
<p>also being curious as to why this has happened.</p>
<p>It like flips your perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s really helped me a lot and it gave me a lot of acceptance and</p>
<p>kind of appreciation for the vehicle my soul chose.</p>
<p>It wanted this one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Your soul chose it.</p>
<p>Your soul fucking hand picked your body to come into to run around this earth to experience</p>
<p>this life.</p>
<p>It wanted what was going to come out of it.</p>
<p>And one thing I really used to hate about my body is my freckles all over me.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if you can see them from this camera, but I have dark brown like freckles</p>
<p>all over me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any on my dick, which is annoying because I wish I had like one on my dick.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That would be cool.</p>
<p>But I have these freckles all over me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all over my body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all over my face.</p>
<p>I used to never notice that I had them.</p>
<p>Like they were never part of my attention.</p>
<p>Like I never like was aware how many I had and where they were until someone pointed</p>
<p>them out and made fun of me for them.</p>
<p>And then I could not stop seeing them.</p>
<p>Like I literally looked at myself in the mirror and I was like, oh my God, they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>all over you.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s disgusting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ugly.</p>
<p>And I literally just started judging myself once it was brought to my attention in a negative</p>
<p>light.</p>
<p>And once it was a pinnacle for someone to make fun of, I turned my back on it and I</p>
<p>fucking hated it.</p>
<p>I literally wanted to go get all of these spots burnt off of me.</p>
<p>I was, I literally had the appointment scheduled to go get them all burnt off and the ones</p>
<p>on my face like cut off and there was going to be like a little bit of a scar, but I already</p>
<p>had procedures planned to go and have the scars like lasered so that they would go down.</p>
<p>Like I was fully committed to getting these the fuck off of me.</p>
<p>And then I kind of had this realization and I like dug deeper into the realm of spirituality</p>
<p>and was like, okay, my soul chose this.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>And it made me start to question everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I had the awareness of like, you don&rsquo;t realize or think something is bad</p>
<p>or negative or wrong about you until someone fucking points it out.</p>
<p>Then you get the negative association.</p>
<p>Then you get the negative opinion of it, and especially if you&rsquo;re made fun of for it.</p>
<p>So I was living for like years where I just hated the spots all over my body.</p>
<p>I was insecure about them.</p>
<p>And then I got to this point where I was like, I want to get them all burnt off.</p>
<p>And then I had the realization, like I said, and I was like, now I have to assess this</p>
<p>situation for what do I think?</p>
<p>Do I think they&rsquo;re disgusting?</p>
<p>Do I think they&rsquo;re weird?</p>
<p>Do I not want them?</p>
<p>Like I looked in the mirror at myself and I was like, huh?</p>
<p>And I looked at all the spots and I was like, they&rsquo;re actually kind of cool.</p>
<p>Like they make me stand out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something different.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s something different to me.</p>
<p>Not a lot of people have.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t look at it anymore as like something to be embarrassed about because I was like,</p>
<p>Leo, your soul chose it.</p>
<p>So having these freckles taught me to learn to think for my fucking self and judge what</p>
<p>I think of myself, regardless of what other people think.</p>
<p>Like even if you think my fucking spots are ugly, I don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re fucking cool.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just boring.</p>
<p>You have normal flat fucking white skin.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve genuinely learned to embrace them and now I like them, but it didn&rsquo;t start out</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>I started with accepting them and be like, okay, they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>And then I made my own opinion about them and I was just kind of like indifferent about</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And the part of me liking them and beginning to enjoy them took time.</p>
<p>And now I like them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not cutting them off.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re fucking cool.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want you to think that you&rsquo;re going to just immediately accept yourself</p>
<p>and love things about yourself.</p>
<p>To go from hating something about yourself to loving it is a far jump.</p>
<p>If you can just get to a place of neutral first, appreciating it will come.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the main perspective I shared about like your soul chose this vehicle gets</p>
<p>you to a place of kind of like neutral about what you have.</p>
<p>Like sure, people with like one arm or one leg, it&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inconvenient.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re annoyed.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t like it, but it does kind of make you like, all right, it was chosen.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m going to explore why.</p>
<p>What potentially like could my soul have fucking wanted from this?</p>
<p>And it just snatches you out of the hate for a second and puts you in a neutral spot.</p>
<p>Like I said, trying to like go from hating the fact that you have like four fingers and</p>
<p>to loving it is going to take a while.</p>
<p>But to have four fingers would kind of be like cool.</p>
<p>And like to have confidence, even if you have something about you that other people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like or wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate, it&rsquo;s kind of like cool as fuck.</p>
<p>Like for people to look at me and like see that I love these freckles about myself, they</p>
<p>wish they could love something that everybody else hates so bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little bit of jealousy.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to break all that down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into all that.</p>
<p>But I do kind of attribute a lot of my like awareness around all this to my freckles and</p>
<p>like I used to hate my stomach because my hip bones are just wide.</p>
<p>Like there is no like shortening them or like making them smaller.</p>
<p>A lot of guys that work out have like a V waist and I fucking wish.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I can&rsquo;t change that.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s nothing I can do.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much weight I lose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always just going to look like I have a bigger midsection.</p>
<p>And that really fucked with me for so long until I realized, Leo, when people look at</p>
<p>you, they&rsquo;re not looking straight at your insecurity.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking exactly at what you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>People look at you and take in the full package.</p>
<p>And having wide hips gave me this awareness.</p>
<p>Like you are not just your insecurity.</p>
<p>I am not just a fucking big stomach or like look like I have a big stomach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being dramatic.</p>
<p>But I had the realization people do not just look at you and see one thing.</p>
<p>They see the entire package.</p>
<p>Like I have so many more things to look at.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m tall.</p>
<p>When I walk in a room, it&rsquo;s like, who the fuck is that mammoth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they look at me as a whole.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t look at just my love handles or just my stomach or how wide my stomach looks.</p>
<p>They look at my arms.</p>
<p>They look at my face.</p>
<p>They look at how I walk.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s attention is focused on so many more things than just the thing you&rsquo;re insecure</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>And I know you get kind of trapped in that little world of like everyone knows about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s worried about it.</p>
<p>Literally, they probably don&rsquo;t even notice it.</p>
<p>My stepdad, Josh, didn&rsquo;t have a thumb on his left hand and didn&rsquo;t have a middle finger.</p>
<p>His hand literally looked like this.</p>
<p>And I did not notice he was missing fingers for like two weeks of knowing him.</p>
<p>And I hung out with him multiple times.</p>
<p>He literally had this.</p>
<p>And I never fucking noticed.</p>
<p>I never realized.</p>
<p>Because people are not focused on just the thing that you are worried about.</p>
<p>Like if my attention was not brought to the fact that he was missing fingers, I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>notice.</p>
<p>I was taking in the full package.</p>
<p>I was taking in the person.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t looking at the fact that he had three fucking fingers, three and a half.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t born like that.</p>
<p>He blew them off with fireworks.</p>
<p>Like he was protecting little kids and like his fingers blew off.</p>
<p>But anyway, I want to give you that piece of reassurance that people are not just looking</p>
<p>at you and their eyes don&rsquo;t just beeline to what&rsquo;s wrong with you.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re worried about.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re insecure about.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just automatically seeing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my hairline.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>But people aren&rsquo;t just like looking at me and be like, oh, look at his hairline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they have to take you in first.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So people that are going to like look at somebody and then begin to nitpick them are people</p>
<p>that are fucking intimidated by you or people that disapprove of so much in themselves.</p>
<p>They look forward in others because that&rsquo;s their sense of like normal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their normal way of behaving and interacting in life.</p>
<p>They nitpick.</p>
<p>They critique.</p>
<p>They see what&rsquo;s wrong about life.</p>
<p>They see why you&rsquo;re not good enough because they don&rsquo;t see why they&rsquo;re good enough.</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;m not going to unpack, but people don&rsquo;t automatically just see your insecurities.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>Okay, so that was a little bit about everything that you can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>Now I want to jump into things that you can control.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re overweight or you&rsquo;re very skinny or you have bad hygiene, that&rsquo;s all you, babe.</p>
<p>You are fully in control of that.</p>
<p>You are fully in control of certain things about your body.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to convince themselves that they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>When I was fat, I was just like, oh, I&rsquo;m just doomed to lose weight.</p>
<p>Motherfucker, start working out and get your diet in check.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Look at me now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have this fucking disorder.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I&rsquo;m not just like unable to lose weight.</p>
<p>I fucking did it.</p>
<p>Like, you have to quit convincing yourself that you can&rsquo;t and see the control you do</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>Basically, for the things that you can change about your body, you are in full control of</p>
<p>that and you can convince yourself that you&rsquo;re not all you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>And it really is easy to just blame your body.</p>
<p>Like when I was overweight, I was like, my body is just fucked up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to just blame my body instead of take responsibility for what I was doing to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I was the reason I was fat.</p>
<p>My actions caused me to be overweight.</p>
<p>But it was easier for me to just blame my body and use that as kind of like the scapegoat</p>
<p>of like, you&rsquo;re the problem.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have to change anything about what I&rsquo;m doing and make myself uncomfortable because</p>
<p>eating good and exercising is not fucking fun.</p>
<p>It is once you do it for a while.</p>
<p>I do enjoy it, but some days I don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to work out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to eat good.</p>
<p>I want to have some crispy cream and get some doughnuts, but I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But basically, convincing yourself that your body is the problem frees you up from a lot</p>
<p>of pressure and a lot of responsibility and nothing&rsquo;s going to change that is in your</p>
<p>control until you understand and accept the responsibility of what you&rsquo;ve done to your</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>You have to look at it squarely for what the fuck you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve caused it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it and it&rsquo;s able to be changed, you caused it.</p>
<p>And I have an example about when I used to get bullied for being overweight and being</p>
<p>fat.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re rejected because of something about your body, it&rsquo;s easy and it feels a lot better</p>
<p>to look at something and have something to blame.</p>
<p>So if someone calls me fat and makes fun of me for it, I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>I feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to look at your body and be like, I fucking hate you.</p>
<p>Then it is to take responsibility for the actions that caused you to be overweight.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s your fault or not, whether you were uneducated or not, it is in your control.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I say your body becomes your scapegoat.</p>
<p>You get to now nitpick it and make your body the problem.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to look at your true self and what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy just to think, oh, this thing can&rsquo;t be changed and it&rsquo;s just unfair for you guys</p>
<p>to make fun of me for it.</p>
<p>Because rejection does make you feel powerless.</p>
<p>You cannot control if someone rejects you or not.</p>
<p>You cannot control if someone makes fun of you or not.</p>
<p>And you gain your sense of control and power back by having something to blame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my body&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not aware that your actions are controlling the way your body looks.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not aware of that, you&rsquo;re just, your brain&rsquo;s automatically going to look for</p>
<p>something to blame because it&rsquo;s easier to sit in a place of anger than sit in a place</p>
<p>of powerlessness.</p>
<p>And when you don&rsquo;t understand that you&rsquo;re in control of the way your body looks, you</p>
<p>feel powerless to change it because you don&rsquo;t know that you can change it.</p>
<p>You are in control of it.</p>
<p>I promise, babe.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying that that&rsquo;s what happens in your brain.</p>
<p>Your brain wants to find something to blame so it can feel a sense of power like, okay,</p>
<p>you have a sense of control over the situation.</p>
<p>If I can have an explanation of why I&rsquo;m being rejected or why I&rsquo;m being mistreated, you</p>
<p>feel a little better.</p>
<p>But this cycle will continue and it will get worse and your relationship with your body</p>
<p>and your relationship to your body will never change until you stop doing that shit.</p>
<p>And the next thing I want to say is do not try and force yourself to like your body the</p>
<p>way it is.</p>
<p>Do not try and force yourself to love yourself if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the way that you look, don&rsquo;t try to convince yourself that you like it.</p>
<p>Stop comforting yourself about the way that you look if you do not like it.</p>
<p>If you wish you looked different, that is okay.</p>
<p>You now know what to do to meet the desire for the way you want to look.</p>
<p>Change your fucking actions and look the way you want to look.</p>
<p>I was not sitting here and trying to force myself to accept myself when I was fat.</p>
<p>I was not trying to love myself when I was fat.</p>
<p>I did have to accept, this is the way that I look right now.</p>
<p>These are my actions that have caused me to look this way.</p>
<p>If I want to look different, I have to change my actions.</p>
<p>I changed my actions, I started showing my body more respect, and in turn it showed me</p>
<p>more respect.</p>
<p>I felt better.</p>
<p>I looked better.</p>
<p>It became easier to like myself.</p>
<p>I treated my body like it was something I cared about and all of a sudden, I felt like</p>
<p>I cared about it.</p>
<p>Your actions can dictate a lot about the way that you feel.</p>
<p>Like I said, you treat it like you care about it, you&rsquo;ll feel more cared about.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just sit here and base it on whether you think you like your body or feel like</p>
<p>you like your body or not.</p>
<p>Your actions can dictate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in full control, but it will help a lot more than you think.</p>
<p>And this is shit people don&rsquo;t tell you.</p>
<p>But my whole point with this is learn to love your body and appreciate your body as you</p>
<p>morph it into what you like.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to force yourself to like something you don&rsquo;t fucking like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s people, places, things, your body, anything.</p>
<p>I talked about it before on a podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trapping yourself in a cage and being like, be happy with being in the cage.</p>
<p>And then you can get out.</p>
<p>Find a way to love being in the cage.</p>
<p>Bitch, why?</p>
<p>Literally open the fucking door and get out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to accept where you are.</p>
<p>You can change where you are.</p>
<p>You can change what you are and how you look.</p>
<p>And then it will naturally just flow that you like it more.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>Just fucking make a goal, stick to it, put your actions and your ass behind your words</p>
<p>and do it.</p>
<p>And then watch what happens.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t have to be so intentional behind, I have to like my body.</p>
<p>I have to only speak nice things to myself.</p>
<p>I have to love myself.</p>
<p>Girl, just fucking change your actions and your thoughts switch.</p>
<p>It takes too much effort and it&rsquo;s so exhausting to fucking force yourself to think positively</p>
<p>about your body all the time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big reason why I created my app Positive Focus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking exhausting to force your focus in a certain way.</p>
<p>The notifications that come up on my app do it for you.</p>
<p>They literally prompt you and give you something to read that just automatically shifts your</p>
<p>focus into something positive.</p>
<p>You have to do that with your body too.</p>
<p>As you start changing it, you&rsquo;re not going to have to put as much effort into liking</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So stop trying to like your body.</p>
<p>Just do the actions, go through the motions, treat it like something you care about.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, you will start to feel like you care about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way humans are.</p>
<p>So one little mind hack and one little trick that I use in my brain that truly helped me</p>
<p>accept my body for the way that it is and stop being so mean to it is I had to separate</p>
<p>myself from my body.</p>
<p>Like I had to just look at my body for what it is.</p>
<p>Like separate yourself from it for a second and look at your body.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little ecosystem that&rsquo;s just trying to survive.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so cute.</p>
<p>If you just look at your body like it&rsquo;s just this little thing trying to survive and it</p>
<p>does the best it can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cute to just observe your body like that.</p>
<p>Like if you feed it, it&rsquo;s going to work.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t feed it, it&rsquo;s going to slow down and be tired.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just trying to take care of itself and make sure it can function.</p>
<p>If you give it too much food, it will store the extra food and the extra calories as fat</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s trying to preserve itself.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t want to die.</p>
<p>So if you give it extra, it&rsquo;s going to store it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not storing weight on you because it hates you and it wants you to look bad.</p>
<p>Your body is trying to make sure it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>If you feed it properly, you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>If you neglect it or you feed it too much, it&rsquo;s going to start doing different shit to</p>
<p>make sure it can stay alive.</p>
<p>Your body&rsquo;s not against you.</p>
<p>Your body is not against you at all.</p>
<p>Your body is working for you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really just trying to take care of itself.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>Think about when you&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>Like I just had a cold a couple days ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still getting over it.</p>
<p>You have mucus and you start getting like stuffed up.</p>
<p>You get a fucking headache.</p>
<p>You get a fever.</p>
<p>These are all things for your body to protect itself.</p>
<p>You get a fever because bacteria and viruses can&rsquo;t live in a hot environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to kill the fucking bacteria.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to be in the body while it&rsquo;s like fighting something off, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally fighting for its little life.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just trying to bring you back to health.</p>
<p>When you start having mucus and shit, your body creates mucus to get the shit out of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re coughing things up, if you&rsquo;re snotty and like blowing things out, it&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to get rid of the toxin that&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you get food poisoning and you throw up.</p>
<p>Your body is trying to get rid of what is hurting you.</p>
<p>Your body&rsquo;s working for you.</p>
<p>And my biggest point with that is like your body is operating correctly.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s its own little ecosystem.</p>
<p>And genuinely it&rsquo;s so cute when you can look at it with that little attitude of appreciation</p>
<p>like, oh, that&rsquo;s what works for me.</p>
<p>Like I try to take care of it and like do the best I can, but I&rsquo;m just like, it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>adorable.</p>
<p>And like, yeah, it&rsquo;s easy to like get mad at it and wish it looked different, but like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just doing what it&rsquo;s supposed to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trying to live, trying to survive with its own little thing.</p>
<p>But when I say treat your body like you care about it, everything you do is either helping</p>
<p>or hurting your body.</p>
<p>So start looking at your actions and clear up the shit and do as much as you can to help</p>
<p>your body operate and function optimally.</p>
<p>And we all know about supplements and like health and exercise and all that shit and</p>
<p>giving it good food.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Help your little ecosystem.</p>
<p>One thing that I do a lot is damage control.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m going to do something that I know is damaging to my body, I will give it things</p>
<p>to help it repair itself.</p>
<p>Like when I drink alcohol, I have a certain set of vitamins that I take before I drink.</p>
<p>I have a certain set of vitamins I take after I drink to help my body get rid of everything</p>
<p>and get me back to normal.</p>
<p>I have like hydration packs.</p>
<p>I smoke.</p>
<p>I smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>So I take a lot of supplements for my lung health.</p>
<p>And it is fucking annoying.</p>
<p>Like I have like six different supplements.</p>
<p>I have to buy separate to take every day.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve been doing for years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like researching ways to take care of my body.</p>
<p>The least I can do is feed it a vitamin.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to go drink or if I&rsquo;m going to smoke cigarettes, the least I can do is give</p>
<p>my body things to help the lungs.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m going to damage them, I&rsquo;m also going to help them too.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the kind of way that I like to balance it.</p>
<p>And my next point with taking care of your body is you do not have to love something</p>
<p>to take care of it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to love your body.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to appreciate your body to take care of it.</p>
<p>And an example I want to give you with this is think of a baby.</p>
<p>Think of a baby like sitting in your fucking floor right now.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know whose baby it is.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to care about it.</p>
<p>It could not look the way you want it to look.</p>
<p>But does that mean the baby does not deserve to be taken care of?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to like it to take care of it.</p>
<p>And the same thing with your body.</p>
<p>You do not have to like something for it to deserve to be taken care of.</p>
<p>Like take care of the motherfucker.</p>
<p>You can be mad and wish it was different all you want.</p>
<p>You can wish you didn&rsquo;t look the way that you did.</p>
<p>You can wish the baby on the floor didn&rsquo;t look the way that it did.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not justification for you to neglect it and to not take care of it.</p>
<p>And to hate something just because of the way that it looks is very fucking mean.</p>
<p>Like imagine someone like having a baby in the middle of their floor and they just neglect</p>
<p>it because they don&rsquo;t like the way that it looks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little chubby.</p>
<p>Babies are meant to be chubby.</p>
<p>It just looks gross.</p>
<p>It just looks&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like snotty and like shits on itself.</p>
<p>Like for someone to look at a baby and choose to not take care of it because it just doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look the way that they want it to look.</p>
<p>What the fuck is that?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>So I want you to take that attitude toward yourself and just because you don&rsquo;t like the</p>
<p>way that you look and you don&rsquo;t like your body right now, that&rsquo;s not an excuse to not</p>
<p>take care of it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to love it to take care of it.</p>
<p>There is no requirement for me to love that fucking baby in the floor to get up and go</p>
<p>take care of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to be taken care of.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything to deserve it.</p>
<p>I should just fucking take care of it.</p>
<p>And I do have another podcast episode about being insecure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Being Insecure and How to Stop and I go in depth about a lot more perspectives</p>
<p>around this.</p>
<p>I think if you struggle with hating your body or not liking your body, that episode will</p>
<p>really help.</p>
<p>I talk about the dynamic of looking for control and making yourself the problem and all that.</p>
<p>So I really think you should listen to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.</p>
<p>Episodes 1-39 of my podcast is only available as audio.</p>
<p>Episode 40 and up is on YouTube.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on YouTube, hi.</p>
<p>If you like this video, leave it a thumbs up.</p>
<p>Just get that shit out the way.</p>
<p>And if you are listening to the audio version, leave me a 5 stars rating.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>But my last kind of like send off for this episode is I want you to decide what you like</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t like about your own body.</p>
<p>Do you like certain things because other people like them?</p>
<p>Do you not like certain things because other people have made fun of them?</p>
<p>Take away everyone&rsquo;s judgment and just look at yourself in the mirror for a second.</p>
<p>Do I really hate this thing?</p>
<p>Does this thing about me deserve to be hated like my little fucking freckles and shit?</p>
<p>Like, is that something really that deserves to be hated?</p>
<p>Or do you only hate it because it leads to you being rejected?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re worried it&rsquo;s going to lead to you being rejected?</p>
<p>I want you to assess things for yourself.</p>
<p>Make your own judgment and your own opinion.</p>
<p>And then when you decide it, you decide it.</p>
<p>I like my fucking freckles.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>I like them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck who says they&rsquo;re ugly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if Oprah or the goddamn Pope said they&rsquo;re ugly.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>I like them.</p>
<p>My opinion stands.</p>
<p>Just because you have a different opinion doesn&rsquo;t mean mine goes away.</p>
<p>If you like something about yourself and your body, that stands.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>Just because other people have a different opinion, it doesn&rsquo;t mean yours is wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to like things other people don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And especially when it comes to your fucking body.</p>
<p>Because being online and on social media, people have nitpicked and commented and hated</p>
<p>on every fucking thing you can think of about me.</p>
<p>From the way that I breathe.</p>
<p>The way that I talk.</p>
<p>The way that I look.</p>
<p>The fact that I&rsquo;m gay.</p>
<p>Literally every fucking thing you can think of, people have talked shit about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had to learn to evaluate everything about myself and my body for myself.</p>
<p>And then once you decide you like something or don&rsquo;t, and you decide to change it or not,</p>
<p>you will feel so much more empowered and confident.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not going to feel like you hate yourself so bad.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re just being taught what to hate.</p>
<p>Like I said, you don&rsquo;t know something&rsquo;s wrong about yourself until someone else points it</p>
<p>out and tells you it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>When you come into this world as a brand new baby, you don&rsquo;t fucking know what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if being fat is wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some cultures where growing up and being overweight is like praised.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some cultures where being like anorexically skinny is praised.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about where you grew up and what you were taught.</p>
<p>You were taught to hate certain things about yourself so you can learn how to not hate</p>
<p>them too.</p>
<p>And everything I shared in this episode is the way to do that.</p>
<p>And for the things that you cannot change about yourself, I want you to genuinely start</p>
<p>opening up to the possibilities and seeing why your soul chose those things.</p>
<p>What are you getting from the things that you hate about yourself?</p>
<p>Just step out of that hate for a second and step into curiosity and trying to understand</p>
<p>that this was a choice and why was it chosen.</p>
<p>If it was a choice.</p>
<p>Because who fucking knows?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll all learn when we die.</p>
<p>But it makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Okay, friends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I got for this podcast episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking tired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sweating.</p>
<p>I was like yelling at you the whole time.</p>
<p>But I really hope this episode helped a lot of you because I needed to hear all this shit.</p>
<p>Little Leo needed to fucking hear this.</p>
<p>Me that was this big?</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I was upset all the time about the way I looked.</p>
<p>But leave me a comment down below what you thought and everything that you need from</p>
<p>me and where you can keep up for me, all of my socials, my one-on-one coaching, the link</p>
<p>to download my app.</p>
<p>Everything is in the description, whether you&rsquo;re listening to the audio version or the</p>
<p>YouTube version.</p>
<p>And like I said, leave me a thumbs up and a five stars.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
