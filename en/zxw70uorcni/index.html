Burke all right okay yes so I&rsquo;m new</p><p>to keto and I&rsquo;m very mathematical and</p><p>I&rsquo;m struggling with figuring out the</p><p>amount of protein I need I watched I</p><p>think maybe one of your latest videos</p><p>and I could see you okay carbs are done</p><p>in grandstander 20 got that but this</p><p>whole protein and the percentage and the</p><p>weights of it so do you have good</p><p>sources that you definitely would</p><p>recommend maybe there&rsquo;s a formula or</p><p>something like that there is a formula</p><p>um I do have this on a video I can&rsquo;t</p><p>tell you where it is but down it&rsquo;s on a</p><p>video</p><p>swish I did one recently the formula is</p><p>0.8 grams per kilogram of weight so you</p><p>just have to figure out you know what&rsquo;s</p><p>you weigh plug it in and that&rsquo;s per day</p><p>not per meal 0.8 between point 8</p><p>kilograms and 1.2 kilograms I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>let me just give it to you again just so</p><p>I get this right point eight grams per</p><p>kilogram of your weight okay so if you</p><p>are a certain kilogram weight you would</p><p>basically divide that so the ranges are</p><p>a point eight to one point two grams</p><p>okay I backs with protein now here&rsquo;s the</p><p>thing what determines that</p><p>is a couple a lot of factors it could be</p><p>your age your ability to digest protein</p><p>how much exercise you do if you&rsquo;re a</p><p>really top athlete you could go up to</p><p>two grams of protein per kilogram of</p><p>weight so that&rsquo;s going to be like more</p><p>than double so that&rsquo;s what I would do</p><p>now what does that look like in for the</p><p>average person excuse me it could be</p><p>anywhere between three to six to eight</p><p>ounces of protein per meal so that&rsquo;s</p><p>what it looks like and it&rsquo;s one of the</p><p>things it&rsquo;s the best way to do this is</p><p>to just experiment and try different</p><p>things try going lower try to go more</p><p>see how you feel so your energy is see</p><p>how your your the overall physiology</p><p>works because it&rsquo;s really hard to</p><p>determine the exact amount unless you</p><p>try everyone so different they&rsquo;ve done a</p><p>lot of different variables that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>would recommend but it is a confusing</p><p>topic but I did do a recent video on</p><p>that Karen what do we got where do we</p><p>have people listening in from they are</p><p>coming in from some different places</p><p>this week South Africa Romania Qatar buy</p><p>ran New York City Florida Minnesota</p><p>obviously all over the United States the</p><p>UK Dubai India Madrid Pakistan and</p><p>they&rsquo;re still coming in wow that&rsquo;s</p><p>amazing</p><p>we have a nice audience people are</p><p>probably you know different time zones</p><p>probably the middle of the night they&rsquo;re</p><p>watching um do you want to give me a</p><p>question I do go ahead yeah so I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s Tobias as</p><p>experiencing excessive saliva yeah in</p><p>low stomach acid what would you</p><p>recommend um I still have a bucket no</p><p>just kidding</p><p>um so too much saliva and not enough</p><p>hydrochloric acid that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re</p><p>dealing with right well I would start</p><p>with the stomach acid you needed to be</p><p>doing apple cider vinegar I would do</p><p>that three I mean every time you eat and</p><p>I would also add betaine hydrochloride</p><p>to actually help increase the stomach</p><p>acid the thing about this whole stomach</p><p>acid thing is there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot to</p><p>know about it but the summary version is</p><p>that as you age you lose the ability to</p><p>produce acid in your stomach and there&rsquo;s</p><p>really only one primary acid that is</p><p>generated in the body that&rsquo;s</p><p>hydrochloric everything else is kind of</p><p>a secondary acid so hydrochloric acid is</p><p>kind of like the controller of a lot of</p><p>other things that happen the body</p><p>whether it&rsquo;s pH digestion or what</p><p>happens to your urine pH for example so</p><p>when people actually measure the pH they</p><p>they might check the saliva or the urine</p><p>they&rsquo;re thinking oh yeah</p><p>I&rsquo;m too acid or I&rsquo;m too alkaline but</p><p>that&rsquo;s just such a low it&rsquo;s a kind of a</p><p>secondary or downstream</p><p>acid you&rsquo;re not going to really get</p><p>valuable information because you don&rsquo;t</p><p>really know what&rsquo;s happening at the</p><p>stomach level when people say oh yeah</p><p>you should be more alkaline acid it</p><p>really depends on if you&rsquo;re talking</p><p>about the blood it&rsquo;s lava the stomach</p><p>the most important thing is really</p><p>getting that stomach acid corrected and</p><p>it needs to be very acid between one and</p><p>three or else everything just doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>work that well someone from the door all</p><p>right what&rsquo;s the next question so this</p><p>is winter yes what&rsquo;s your best advice</p><p>for recovering from a cold or a flu</p><p>quickly there&rsquo;s a couple things you can</p><p>do to increase recovery and duration</p><p>especially if it&rsquo;s related to the flu or</p><p>cold or virus and that would be</p><p>think think think is um probably one of</p><p>the best things vitamin D that&rsquo;s right</p><p>up there zinc in vitamin D those two are</p><p>just like the go-to and of course</p><p>intermittent fasting would be good as</p><p>well for sure I mean if you think about</p><p>when you get seven star cold</p><p>that&rsquo;s right when you get sick you tend</p><p>to lose your appetite because your</p><p>body&rsquo;s trying to tell you don&rsquo;t eat</p><p>because your body just goes into this</p><p>mode where it starts to repair and heal</p><p>so but zinc is really good and you can</p><p>if you have shingles for example you can</p><p>put it topically on the wound because</p><p>zinc tends to put viruses back of</p><p>remission and shingles is a virus single</p><p>some herpes zoster comes from chickenpox</p><p>right so we know it well you do and it</p><p>comes out later on a life when you kind</p><p>of get tired burnt-out and stressed out</p><p>except you know it was interesting</p><p>what&rsquo;s interesting is that I was a child</p><p>when I had shingles that&rsquo;s a very</p><p>interesting care yeah that&rsquo;s a very</p><p>interesting well here you go</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to mark from Queens New York</p><p>good a question mark yeah good morning</p><p>well you&rsquo;ve done and especially thanks</p><p>for caring well thank you yeah yeah yeah</p><p>why do you say that you&rsquo;re just like a</p><p>joy and then like when dr. Berg like</p><p>kind of bears off course you&rsquo;re like</p><p>there too like gentle you gave him back</p><p>of course</p><p>yeah well thank you for noticing</p><p>appreciate it yeah I tend to kind of go</p><p>off the deep end sometimes you just pull</p><p>me out the woods like okay let&rsquo;s stay on</p><p>top yeah sometimes I&rsquo;m talking over you</p><p>know to myself and then you&rsquo;re like no</p><p>actually the person needs understand</p><p>right good so go ahead mark what was</p><p>your question</p><p>oh my question was what&rsquo;s your you like</p><p>your seeded blood pressure your purse</p><p>no actual to your blood pressure mm-hmm</p><p>and and then I have a follow-up if you</p><p>mean if it&rsquo;s if that&rsquo;s you if it&rsquo;s a</p><p>quick one yes okay and the follow-up is</p><p>just like how maybe the the the</p><p>so-called normal range for glucose may</p><p>be actually a little high is it possible</p><p>that what we consider normal for blood</p><p>pressure oh that&rsquo;s it you&rsquo;ve got some</p><p>good questions</p><p>I like that okay so do what&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see</p><p>what the next question is here for the</p><p>next prisoner now here my I do check my</p><p>blood pressure</p><p>at least three times a week it&rsquo;s on the</p><p>lower side it&rsquo;s 110 over 75 ish on</p><p>average like pulse rates like 65 so yes</p><p>I do believe that the numbers do run</p><p>high and that leads into the next video</p><p>that I&rsquo;m going to be doing that stay</p><p>tuned in next couple days because I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to be talking about the thyroid</p><p>hormone which is fascinating in</p><p>relationship to this concept that you</p><p>need carbs to get the thyroid because it</p><p>is true that when you go in the lock low</p><p>carb diet your active thyroid hormones</p><p>t3 goes down by 40% but if you don&rsquo;t</p><p>know the whole picture it could be very</p><p>scary so stay tuned for that video</p><p>that&rsquo;s coming out but that also relates</p><p>to all these other hormones like even</p><p>insulin you know we don&rsquo;t need as much</p><p>insulin especially fasting insulin level</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think we need as much tea for</p><p>our t3 so and the blood pressure I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s on the high side and also blood</p><p>glucose you know normal used to be like</p><p>100 or between like eighty and hundred</p><p>but the point is that when you start</p><p>doing key though even that&rsquo;s too high it</p><p>comes down to seventy five seventy</p><p>sometimes 65 and even lower and a lot of</p><p>individuals because you&rsquo;re not going to</p><p>need that you&rsquo;re running on blue ketone</p><p>so you&rsquo;re not going to be running on</p><p>glucose anymore so the need for that</p><p>goes way down but very very good</p><p>questions very good questions mark good</p><p>job</p><p>all right Karen yes can you give me a</p><p>question I can&rsquo;t an easy one</p><p>Oh easy one these guys are pretty pretty</p><p>good here so someone asked and I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>if I don&rsquo;t say your name because you</p><p>sometimes I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not a name</p><p>anyway someone from YouTube this is</p><p>fasting keeps them awake yeah how can</p><p>they remedy that so they can have a good</p><p>night&rsquo;s sleep at night Wow</p><p>I thought you wanted to give me an easy</p><p>one though what happens when you when</p><p>you do fast a lot of things change</p><p>hormonal II they go go for the better</p><p>and like things start becoming more</p><p>efficient inflammation goes down you go</p><p>on healing mode I believe that the need</p><p>for sleep does go down a little bit</p><p>so it could be that your body is just</p><p>not needing as much sleep that&rsquo;s one</p><p>theory</p><p>but over time when your body adjusts you</p><p>you should actually need between six</p><p>point five and seven point five hours</p><p>some people need a little bit more but</p><p>that&rsquo;s kind of my my answer on that I</p><p>hope that&rsquo;s sufficient that your take on</p><p>it that&rsquo;s my two cents and I&rsquo;m sticking</p><p>to it</p><p>okay good so our pistachios okay on keto</p><p>well I just released a video on that and</p><p>it&rsquo;s one of the best nuts out there</p><p>because it&rsquo;s very low on oxalates so you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have as the risk of ox with stones</p><p>like almonds other nuts do so it&rsquo;s low</p><p>and it&rsquo;s probably one of the lowest nuts</p><p>it is but usually you probably going to</p><p>want those roasted because raw</p><p>pistachios just just are not tasty at</p><p>all they&rsquo;re like pretty pretty terrible</p><p>oh if you&rsquo;re gonna soak them you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna roast them soak them a roasted</p><p>parent you have to dry them out but the</p><p>point is that yes the point you want to</p><p>definitely salted and but you ever</p><p>notice that pistachios are slightly</p><p>green no not even slightly they&rsquo;re green</p><p>dashes are green and you know why</p><p>what else is green in nature I stash</p><p>your ice cream good and what else</p><p>grass good and that&rsquo;s the bowl that&rsquo;s</p><p>right because the chlorophyll so the</p><p>chlorophyll is what you&rsquo;re seeing in the</p><p>in that nut and honestly it&rsquo;s not really</p><p>not it&rsquo;s a seed that is in a fruit but</p><p>we&rsquo;re just gonna call it or not right</p><p>now I know that that opens the door just</p><p>a lot of questions but the point is that</p><p>it&rsquo;s loaded with chlorophyll which is</p><p>really good for a lot of things</p><p>antioxidant and it&rsquo;s also very high in</p><p>vitamin E and so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s full of</p><p>nutrition so hop on the carbs very low</p><p>very high in fat healthy fats in</p><p>moderate protein I think there&rsquo;s a song</p><p>on that we won&rsquo;t sing on that right now</p><p>but I want to go to olesja from Bristol</p><p>Pennsylvania you had a question go ahead</p><p>good morning dr. Burke we&rsquo;ll just let me</p><p>say thank you to everyone I can&rsquo;t even</p><p>express gratitude and thankfulness to</p><p>you guys just thank you for being there</p><p>for us are you welcome my quick question</p><p>I have SIBO I just realized that</p><p>recently and I&rsquo;ve been on keto for a</p><p>year really strict one and I want to</p><p>stop eating veggies increase my digest</p><p>formula and maybe increase Goldwater</p><p>formula is it safe to take eight pills</p><p>of they just per meal if it&rsquo;s safe to</p><p>take more Goldwater formula more than</p><p>one one tablet per meal maybe I should</p><p>take those during the day you just</p><p>without meals because I&rsquo;m doing</p><p>intermittent fasting - okay good</p><p>questions see Bo for those people that</p><p>don&rsquo;t know what that is that&rsquo;s a small</p><p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth and</p><p>normally you should have all your</p><p>microbes and most of microbes in the</p><p>large intestine but when you go into the</p><p>small intestine that becomes the problem</p><p>because they weren&rsquo;t meant to be there</p><p>so they start robbing your nutrition and</p><p>taking your vitamins and you become all</p><p>you get gassy and the more fiber that</p><p>you need</p><p>in the form of vegetables and the more</p><p>probiotics that we&rsquo;re sensing so I</p><p>always recommend you know go on</p><p>carnivore for a month or two</p><p>reset take oregano oil and take more</p><p>certifiers like from the digestive plus</p><p>or digestive formula so you could take a</p><p>lot of that and you could probably take</p><p>eight or nine per meal without any</p><p>problem at all</p><p>in fact my guitar teacher found that</p><p>when he consumes nine per meal he can go</p><p>to Five Guys I&rsquo;m like no no don&rsquo;t do</p><p>that but the point is that you do want</p><p>more acidifier and that&rsquo;s not a problem</p><p>and you can take more gallbladder</p><p>formula take maybe two or three after</p><p>the meal that gallbladder formula is</p><p>quite magical because it really just it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t just give you bile salts it</p><p>gives you also some betaine</p><p>hydrochloride some enzymes for the</p><p>stomach for the pancreas and to</p><p>lubricate the bile duct so it&rsquo;s a very</p><p>popular effective for bloating and a lot</p><p>of other issues good question all right</p><p>Karen do we have a question sure yeah</p><p>hey so on keto is sparkling water okay</p><p>absolutely I recommend it I I I like</p><p>sparkling water it just seems to help my</p><p>digestion it since it&rsquo;s slightly more</p><p>acidic</p><p>I mean don&rsquo;t know why exactly it helps</p><p>digestion but it seems to I feel more</p><p>hydrated so it&rsquo;s really up to your</p><p>preference but yeah it&rsquo;s not gonna knock</p><p>you out keto at all and I think there&rsquo;s</p><p>a difference right you have sparkling</p><p>water and then you have mineral water</p><p>then you have sparkling mineral water</p><p>cuz you have a club soda if you go to a</p><p>restaurant you ask for sparkling water</p><p>sometimes they&rsquo;ll just bring you club</p><p>soda and that&rsquo;s a different thing than</p><p>like San Pellegrino right or something</p><p>like that that&rsquo;s correct that&rsquo;s a</p><p>correct statement okay oh they all those</p><p>are just things that popped out of my</p><p>head it&rsquo;s really incredibly relevant but</p><p>I mean in terms of its effect on the</p><p>body probably right well okay good so</p><p>now that we&rsquo;re talking about things that</p><p>are sequitur I&rsquo;m gonna go right to my</p><p>commercial this is our new different</p><p>camera our new keto desserts okay this</p><p>one here is the peanut butter cup this</p><p>one is the pecan pie these just became</p><p>available you can go to dr. Byrne calm</p><p>under keto desserts and I just wanted to</p><p>mention why we came up with these when</p><p>you go from meal to meal and you want to</p><p>be able to do it&rsquo;s a little faster or</p><p>longer we always recommend eating a fat</p><p>plus we also recommend going low carb</p><p>desserts you can make your own keto</p><p>bombs so this is basically a keto bomb</p><p>in a desert or as a desert and you just</p><p>scoop it out with a spoon we know much</p><p>would you eat one the two tablespoons</p><p>not the whole jar even though it&rsquo;s very</p><p>very tempting it does have almonds</p><p>roasted pecans or organic palm oil which</p><p>I want to mention because some people</p><p>are like oh my gosh palm oil so that</p><p>it&rsquo;s actually not good if it&rsquo;s from</p><p>Fairtrade and it&rsquo;s from a very good farm</p><p>and it&rsquo;s load of vitamin E actually</p><p>coconut oil does not have basically any</p><p>vitamins it has essential fats but palm</p><p>oil does have vitamins so that&rsquo;s why I</p><p>want to put that in there it has medium</p><p>chain triglycerides so it&rsquo;s going to go</p><p>with the ketones to help your cognitive</p><p>memory and function natural flavors now</p><p>this is another point that people bring</p><p>up because you if you go to the grocery</p><p>store and you see all these foods with</p><p>natural flavors or flavorings a lot of</p><p>times use msg and all sorts of chemicals</p><p>can I call msg naturally yeah they can</p><p>call that natural flavoring absolutely</p><p>because it&rsquo;s not even a flavoring it&rsquo;s a</p><p>drug if it&rsquo;s used for and it&rsquo;s used as a</p><p>additive they don&rsquo;t have to list it as</p><p>msg I just did a video no I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>release it yet though but these this</p><p>natural flavoring is like the essence of</p><p>the thing like it has what it&rsquo;s from</p><p>natural things herbs spices so it gives</p><p>you a much better flavor</p><p>al ulos which is one of my favorite sure</p><p>alcohol&rsquo;s is a it&rsquo;s zero on the glycemic</p><p>index it doesn&rsquo;t seem to create how many</p><p>digestive issues</p><p>stevia wreath rotol and sea salt so</p><p>these are little similar but you can</p><p>check it on the website they&rsquo;re very</p><p>delicious very addicting if you need</p><p>something to go from one meal to the</p><p>next you might want to check them out</p><p>just go to dr. Berg com alright so</p><p>another question for you yes so ok</p><p>vertical lines on the nails yes what</p><p>about it what about it well it could</p><p>mean a couple things it could be a</p><p>biotin deficiency which is a type of the</p><p>B vitamin it could also be an iron</p><p>deficiency how do you know which is</p><p>which well I did a video on it check it</p><p>out and when you actually well here&rsquo;s</p><p>the thing like let&rsquo;s say is it biotin or</p><p>is it iron you&rsquo;re gonna have to you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to know I&rsquo;ll tell you in a</p><p>second but you&rsquo;re gonna have to know</p><p>what are some other deficiencies of iron</p><p>to actually understand that but I don&rsquo;t</p><p>even recommend using a specific nutrient</p><p>to fix that I would like to recommend</p><p>first do healthy keto do it do the in a</p><p>minute fasting before you start treating</p><p>symptoms because chances are you&rsquo;re not</p><p>doing how Paquito correctly because if</p><p>you were you might not even have the</p><p>ridges on the fingernail so we always</p><p>want to start there because if you go to</p><p>a specific remedy or a trace mineral</p><p>without fixing the core problem you&rsquo;re</p><p>treating symptoms and that&rsquo;s how they</p><p>teach us in school but it&rsquo;s not the best</p><p>way got it okay yep alright did you like</p><p>that answer I loved it okay that was</p><p>perfect</p><p>Karen you&rsquo;re from Queen Creek Arizona</p><p>you had a question go ahead yes thank</p><p>you for taking my call I recently had a</p><p>12 millimeter kidney stone that went</p><p>through two procedures to eliminate and</p><p>I just found out yesterday that the</p><p>kidney stone was actually made with</p><p>calcium</p><p>so I really want to try to avoid getting</p><p>any future kidney stones so what do you</p><p>suggest I do to prevent them do you was</p><p>a calcium oxalates uh you know what she</p><p>didn&rsquo;t tell me I was just talking to her</p><p>over the phone I go to the doctor next</p><p>Friday but she all she told me was that</p><p>it was calcium yeah it&rsquo;s probably</p><p>calcium oxalates so this is what I would</p><p>do Karen if I were you like there&rsquo;s like</p><p>really important things and then there&rsquo;s</p><p>like not lesser important things the</p><p>number-one thing is to understand that</p><p>the calcium the the this stone is</p><p>developed because of a supersaturated</p><p>condition so to solve that just increase</p><p>your fluids right off the bat so you</p><p>could start doing to minimum to 3 liters</p><p>of fluid per day and I&rsquo;m talking about</p><p>adding electrolytes to you&rsquo;re not just</p><p>like playing water so 2 to 3 liters a</p><p>day should prevent any stones just from</p><p>that alone okay that&rsquo;s number one number</p><p>two you want to do the lemon juice every</p><p>day because the sit rates combined with</p><p>the oxalates and that will counter that</p><p>formation of of course a given thing is</p><p>like avoid things with high end oxalates</p><p>I have tons of videos on this spinach</p><p>rhubarb almonds Kiwis of course you</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t be on Kiwi if you were doing my</p><p>program so the other thing that you can</p><p>do is that to take a little calcium when</p><p>you&rsquo;re eating because if there&rsquo;s</p><p>oxalates in your food what will happen</p><p>the cheese whatever during the meal the</p><p>calcium will combine with the oxalates</p><p>and go through the digestive system</p><p>won&rsquo;t be good it won&rsquo;t be absorbed into</p><p>the blood and end up in your kidney of</p><p>stones but that&rsquo;s the most important</p><p>thing and I would just focus on that and</p><p>check out some of the videos that I&rsquo;ve</p><p>done recently on that thanks Karen</p><p>all right Karen okay so good question</p><p>yeah we have a bunch of questions coming</p><p>in on both Facebook and YouTube about</p><p>hair yeah and hair loss some questions</p><p>are</p><p>Wilke doh help reverse hair loss and</p><p>other questions are will Quito cause</p><p>hair loss what&rsquo;s up with the hair ladies</p><p>well if you do dirty Kido you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>end up with deficiencies so I recommend</p><p>something called healthy Quito which</p><p>you&rsquo;re actually eating really</p><p>nutrient-dense foods like big salad the</p><p>protein the omega-3 fatty acids and then</p><p>add in there the B vitamins with trace</p><p>minerals with electrolytes because if</p><p>you don&rsquo;t when you go on keto and which</p><p>is basically it&rsquo;s low fat you could be</p><p>ending up with because you need certain</p><p>nutrients more than others and you could</p><p>end up with some deficiencies that could</p><p>lead to the hair loss and that&rsquo;s mainly</p><p>going to be probably something of the B</p><p>vitamins maybe trace minerals because</p><p>it&rsquo;s hard to get unless you&rsquo;re eating</p><p>certain foods like shellfish and seafood</p><p>things like that on a regular basis what</p><p>about genetic hair loss as far as genes</p><p>go belief people tend to I just did a</p><p>video on this I didn&rsquo;t release it yet</p><p>people think that a lot of their health</p><p>problems are genetic they&rsquo;re inherited</p><p>so you have to just pick your parents</p><p>more wisely right but here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>only 5 maybe 10 percent of our health or</p><p>disease things are related to genetics</p><p>everything else this is called</p><p>epigenetics which is above genetics</p><p>which basically have to do with your</p><p>lifestyle your social stress levels your</p><p>nutrition what you but your mom you know</p><p>fed you growing up what you basically</p><p>ate before you were born in the womb I</p><p>mean there&rsquo;s so many different factors</p><p>so what you&rsquo;re exposed to now that&rsquo;s</p><p>true but with regard to hair loss I mean</p><p>isn&rsquo;t there some some pretty significant</p><p>evidence that there&rsquo;s a genetic there is</p><p>a tonight yeah there is but it&rsquo;s not as</p><p>high as you think there are things you</p><p>can do to kind of that now especially</p><p>with women there&rsquo;s this condition called</p><p>PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome where</p><p>they tend to lose the hair they might</p><p>get alopecia in which case they need</p><p>selenium and zinc which is another trace</p><p>mineral</p><p>in shellfish if you were to consume that</p><p>but also the main thing is to lower the</p><p>testosterone one of the things that you</p><p>ever notice like like women when you go</p><p>through the recite menstrual cycle</p><p>they might get acne like around their</p><p>chin right they&rsquo;re like what is going on</p><p>every month I go through this right well</p><p>when you get close to your period</p><p>estrogen progesterone drops so it&rsquo;s not</p><p>really those two vitamins that are</p><p>causing the acne</p><p>it&rsquo;s the androgen the testosterone that</p><p>is going up in relationship to these</p><p>other videos because even with</p><p>polycystic ovarian syndrome you have</p><p>high levels of energy and you get facial</p><p>hair you lose your hair up on top of</p><p>your head you get a deeper voice so that</p><p>comes from high levels of insulin so as</p><p>long as you keep your insulin low you do</p><p>keto many times that improves your hair</p><p>just like that but then if you if you</p><p>add in the trace minerals and the B</p><p>vitamins and the healthy version that</p><p>should take care of the hair there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot information that was a lot cramping</p><p>to keeping up and that&rsquo;s another topic</p><p>scape you&rsquo;ll get to 30 pounds down any</p><p>even more socks a way yeah things can</p><p>change the world can change Steve is</p><p>wearing socks and shoes okay what about</p><p>skin condition getting worse with quito</p><p>and if&rsquo; what do you suspect is happening</p><p>I think they&rsquo;re doing too much cheese</p><p>usually that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s it because that&rsquo;s</p><p>affecting the hormone it could be a B</p><p>vitamin deficiency because you have</p><p>something called keto rash that&rsquo;s a like</p><p>a b5 deficiency it could be a food</p><p>allergy like I&rsquo;ll give me an example</p><p>this is very rare but when I was in</p><p>practice there is this this one lady who</p><p>started breaking out and all sorts of</p><p>skin rashes and hives and and we</p><p>isolated it was vegetables go figure</p><p>so she was very sensible sensitive to</p><p>vegetables so that was that never</p><p>happened with anyone else but her</p><p>she got off a lot of vegetables and she</p><p>did very well on just carnivore so some</p><p>people do not do well with certain</p><p>things in vegetables there are you know</p><p>lectins which are different chemicals</p><p>and there&rsquo;s oxalates and there&rsquo;s other</p><p>things but for the most part most people</p><p>can handle them fine fair enough fair</p><p>enough all right let&rsquo;s go to Ashley from</p><p>Pittsburgh Pennsylvania okay question</p><p>for your question I did a high pasture</p><p>burg I&rsquo;m related to talk to you hi Karen</p><p>you&rsquo;re both hilarious</p><p>thank you so much for informing people I</p><p>try to do the best to pass on</p><p>information but it doesn&rsquo;t well so my</p><p>question is in the past six months</p><p>thank you in the past six months I</p><p>started Keita for health reasons since I</p><p>was already pretty lean I just want to</p><p>cut up and see what would happen I&rsquo;ll</p><p>never go back however I have gotten to</p><p>yeast infections in that past six months</p><p>I did watch your video about kill</p><p>Candida with keto and are in fasting but</p><p>is there reason that that could be cool</p><p>related poquito you mean</p><p>oh okay so here&rsquo;s what happens when you</p><p>actually cut down your carbs you starve</p><p>the the food for yeast that&rsquo;s what you</p><p>understand right yeah</p><p>yeah so in theory the ye should go away</p><p>but if it doesn&rsquo;t go away a lot of times</p><p>what happens is you get something called</p><p>die-off so you&rsquo;re starving the yeast and</p><p>you get die-off and see the die-off from</p><p>yeast is sometimes very toxic it can</p><p>make you feel sick and you it feels like</p><p>you have a yeast infection but it&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of just like side effects from killing</p><p>off the yeast there are certain enzymes</p><p>that help you break it down and there&rsquo;s</p><p>one trace mineral that&rsquo;s a a really</p><p>important one especially for the die-off</p><p>of you so you can just get it it&rsquo;s the</p><p>molybdenum okay</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can say that three</p><p>times aluminum molybdenum</p><p>molybdenum yeah so if you get that trace</p><p>mineral I mean you&rsquo;re not to take a lot</p><p>of it just take a smaller amount</p><p>whatever&rsquo;s on the label and then take it</p><p>for about a month and I would also make</p><p>sure to take the other trace minerals</p><p>just because sometimes over time they</p><p>can complete your copper but that&rsquo;s an</p><p>interesting a trace mineral that helps</p><p>to detoxify and clean up the byproducts</p><p>of the yeast reaction it&rsquo;s also good to</p><p>detoxify like drugs out of the liver</p><p>it&rsquo;s also good for gout</p><p>it&rsquo;s also good for sulfites from</p><p>different foods so it&rsquo;ll do a lot but</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would recommend good</p><p>question Karen I&rsquo;m gonna get to you but</p><p>I need to go to Diane she&rsquo;s been waiting</p><p>patiently from Laguna Beach California</p><p>you had a question right yes I do and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve watched over 400 of your videos and</p><p>I just thank you for all of them they&rsquo;ve</p><p>really helped me and I have been</p><p>constipated for three years and so you</p><p>taught me to use some potassium and and</p><p>I added that in I I&rsquo;ve been constipated</p><p>for three years I&rsquo;ve had Siebel for</p><p>eight months and I went on healthy keto</p><p>about seven months ago and that&rsquo;s helped</p><p>me a lot and I have to grind up my</p><p>protein and my vegetable but I&rsquo;m</p><p>crashing all through the day from</p><p>electrolyte and I have to keep taking</p><p>more electrolytes and so now that&rsquo;s</p><p>turned into loose stool and it&rsquo;s like</p><p>I&rsquo;m not absorbing the potassium and the</p><p>magnesium and I&rsquo;m getting leg cramps at</p><p>night and I know that my potassium and</p><p>magnesium are too high because I have</p><p>the loose stool but yet I keep crashing</p><p>okay I know what to do what do you</p><p>reckon um I know what to do you&rsquo;re ready</p><p>for this are you sitting down I&rsquo;m</p><p>sitting down okay good</p><p>you need to increase your sea salt</p><p>increase the sea salt that&rsquo;s what you</p><p>need now because one of the things is my</p><p>electrolyte powder I don&rsquo;t have here is</p><p>very high in potassium magnesium in the</p><p>other minerals very low in sodium so we</p><p>want to increase the sodium and that</p><p>will handle the cramps like that so</p><p>anytime you&rsquo;re on the electrolyte powder</p><p>just don&rsquo;t forget about the sea salt you</p><p>can put in food or just add it but I</p><p>would start increasing it a little bit</p><p>more and watch the cramps go bye-bye</p><p>the other possible reason that you need</p><p>a lot of electrolytes is that your your</p><p>stomach pH is not acidic enough so you</p><p>may need to have some that&rsquo;s an episode</p><p>of vinegar to that and there&rsquo;s other</p><p>reasons as well could be something with</p><p>the gut but that&rsquo;s what I would do as a</p><p>no-brainer do that this week Diann and</p><p>call us not next week but the following</p><p>week and let us know how you do because</p><p>next week we are going to be out out of</p><p>town but the following week we&rsquo;ll be</p><p>here and I&rsquo;m glad to just remember that</p><p>yeah people that will be like waiting</p><p>okay Karen I am ready for a question</p><p>okay good ones okay good and I want to</p><p>let you know there&rsquo;s a lot of questions</p><p>and issues here but probably 50% or more</p><p>than 50% of all the comments are about</p><p>people that are having good results</p><p>losing weigh resolving situations so</p><p>sometimes kind of hard to find a in a</p><p>problem you haven&rsquo;t talked about I mean</p><p>there&rsquo;s some of them are real common and</p><p>the question is always relate to a</p><p>friend someone has a friend without has</p><p>right so here&rsquo;s a person made a comment</p><p>they have a variety of things muscle</p><p>pain knee popping digestion issues on</p><p>keto so I&rsquo;m assuming they&rsquo;re saying</p><p>since they got on taquito they&rsquo;ve</p><p>experienced some of these things I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know what kind of keto but they say keto</p><p>so we got knee popping muscle aches</p><p>muscle</p><p>pain okay okay and digestion issues</p><p>digestive issues okay well the muscle</p><p>pain could be either low vitamin D or</p><p>low vitamin E okay or they&rsquo;re not doing</p><p>and I&rsquo;m going to fasting long enough the</p><p>popping is the low b1 and then you said</p><p>achiness right muscle pain muscle pain</p><p>it&rsquo;s low vitamin D low vitamin D so</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing guys it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>virtually impossible to get your vitamin</p><p>D from your food and it&rsquo;s virtually</p><p>impossible to get your vitamin D in</p><p>January out in the Sun it&rsquo;s why you need</p><p>to go somewhere sunny in January yeah</p><p>but the point is that during the winter</p><p>winter months you need to actually be</p><p>taking vitamin D with k2 because it is</p><p>so powerful it is one of the most</p><p>actually I think it&rsquo;s the most important</p><p>vitamin which is not even vitamin it&rsquo;s a</p><p>hormone but it&rsquo;s actually good to</p><p>protect your immune system especially</p><p>against viruses so don&rsquo;t forget about</p><p>that menu right reminds me I have taken</p><p>my vitamin D today doc is that d3 yes</p><p>d3 that&rsquo;s correct Steve not d2 is there</p><p>a d2 yes there is ah let&rsquo;s go to Helen</p><p>from Jackson Mississippi can get a</p><p>question hello thank you for taking my</p><p>call I just want to say I thank you for</p><p>the good work that you do for us all I</p><p>do have a question so I have been</p><p>allocator diet for I see two months now</p><p>and I have been seeing great results</p><p>thanks to you and last week I was</p><p>diagnosed with HIV</p><p>so at this point my question is will I</p><p>be putting myself into danger if I start</p><p>taking the antibiotics I haven&rsquo;t seen a</p><p>physician react but these are just the</p><p>questions that are bothering me and what</p><p>would be a proper of best natural</p><p>treatment so h pylori and would you</p><p>advise me to stop the killer diet</p><p>focus on treating the each calorie at</p><p>this point I am just very conscious that</p><p>the very and also what meals can I be</p><p>eating at this point</p><p>yeah sure javi I just have a question</p><p>for you do you have stomach pains or</p><p>stomach heartburn or any digestive</p><p>problems right now at this alright now I</p><p>have my bloating I do not feel anything</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s just yeah I just you here&rsquo;s my</p><p>here&rsquo;s my answer I can&rsquo;t tell you not to</p><p>take your medication I can&rsquo;t tell you</p><p>that so all I can do is tell you to</p><p>research certain things and I would</p><p>watch my videos in h pylori and you can</p><p>get more data but the first thing that I</p><p>would highly recommend whether you get</p><p>treated or not is to not change keto or</p><p>Amanda fasting because you want to go</p><p>back to more carbs that would not make</p><p>sense secondly you want to increase the</p><p>acidity of your stomach because there&rsquo;s</p><p>a big connection between the pH of your</p><p>stomach and that microbe huge and you&rsquo;ll</p><p>be able to show you that when you watch</p><p>the video you need more acid betaine</p><p>hydrochloride episode of vinegar in the</p><p>stomach to help yourself that&rsquo;s what I</p><p>would do if I were you</p><p>thanks Helen alright Karen okay so we</p><p>have a request for you to advise what</p><p>should kids eat well kids should do the</p><p>same program but if there are very small</p><p>kids I don&rsquo;t recommend in a minute</p><p>fasting but I don&rsquo;t recommend a lot of</p><p>snacks either because I mean think about</p><p>nowadays I mean these kids are just</p><p>given every every hour like here give me</p><p>some food give him some food like I</p><p>don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t agree with that I think we</p><p>should do 3 3 meals with you know per</p><p>day with 4 kids and then we do fine but</p><p>they do still want to do a little car</p><p>they can get a give by with more carbs</p><p>for sure maybe they go up to 70 grams a</p><p>day or even 80 grams a day maybe a</p><p>little bit of sweet potato maybe a</p><p>little bit of</p><p>brown rice if you want to but I wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>start going with the grains I did a</p><p>video on this Karen it&rsquo;s more in-depth</p><p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m I don&rsquo;t want to spend too</p><p>much time right question but and and</p><p>there are a lot of questions here what</p><p>would you say to people who aren&rsquo;t</p><p>getting their questions answered here I</p><p>wish I had more videos to give you guys</p><p>actually I do I do</p><p>they&rsquo;re on YouTube I have you know I</p><p>just won&rsquo;t let you guys if you knew I</p><p>want to say that sometimes it might be</p><p>hard to find them and I&rsquo;m we&rsquo;re working</p><p>on that a better index but I have videos</p><p>on every single question you guys are</p><p>asking I&rsquo;m serious I have questions that</p><p>every single because here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>when I try to come up with new videos</p><p>I&rsquo;ll go right to my YouTube and I&rsquo;m like</p><p>oh my gosh I did two videos on that</p><p>already so I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s not easy to find new</p><p>content but I&rsquo;m doing it but the point</p><p>is that we have so many videos on every</p><p>single topic you are asking every so if</p><p>you feel like we&rsquo;re not answering your</p><p>question just go to youtube and search</p><p>it yeah if you go to youtube and write</p><p>dr. Berg and then whatever your question</p><p>is ridges on fingernails bloating</p><p>constipation diarrhea any anything I</p><p>mean other than the the lab result</p><p>questions you know yeah and I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m I</p><p>already have this out other side to make</p><p>this link more available I think what</p><p>I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll put it on my website as</p><p>a big bold button of it&rsquo;s a document I</p><p>already have this done it&rsquo;s one document</p><p>that just lists all the videos that I&rsquo;ve</p><p>ever done in YouTube and you just need</p><p>to just go down the document so that way</p><p>it won&rsquo;t get lost in YouTube land you</p><p>can just go to the document there&rsquo;s the</p><p>video I need and it just pops up the</p><p>video so that is something is it</p><p>categorized or is it yes</p><p>it&rsquo;s organized we spent a long time</p><p>doing it and I think that that&rsquo;s good</p><p>you should have that I need to put that</p><p>on the website so go to the website stay</p><p>tuned dr. Burke comm also on dr. Berg</p><p>comm for everybody who is new there</p><p>videos that tell you exactly how to get</p><p>started</p><p>new taquito watch these three videos on</p><p>exactly how to get since the first video</p><p>in the blog step one</p><p>yeah and I got step two and step three</p><p>it&rsquo;s like right across the top yeah make</p><p>it super simple super simple I have a</p><p>question here oh and somebody brought up</p><p>a good point I don&rsquo;t know if this is the</p><p>point they were bringing up there just</p><p>like January because you said vitamin D</p><p>and January that&rsquo;s just the United</p><p>States right Wow North America right</p><p>because you know Australia</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s summer in joint care that&rsquo;s a</p><p>really good point I didn&rsquo;t think of that</p><p>until now you just brought that up yeah</p><p>so depending on where you live your</p><p>January yeah out in the Sun dead of</p><p>winter right winter is coming</p><p>in the US and it&rsquo;s gonna be cold winter</p><p>yeah good point Ken now would you</p><p>recommend intermittent fasting for dogs</p><p>highly recommend it Charlie&rsquo;s on I</p><p>honestly if I had it my way I would feed</p><p>our dog 1 mil a day that&rsquo;s just my</p><p>opinion</p><p>oh he doesn&rsquo;t get to do that but he eats</p><p>twice a day but I mean look here&rsquo;s</p><p>another another answer to that question</p><p>look at dogs that eat all day long I</p><p>mean you do treats right oh that&rsquo;s not</p><p>all the treat oh my gosh it&rsquo;s so bad or</p><p>people who are being mounds and mounds I</p><p>mean with our last job Trixie we I would</p><p>give her food one time a day and she</p><p>would nibble on it throughout the day</p><p>she never overrate I mean I don&rsquo;t think</p><p>all dogs are like that like yeah but if</p><p>you&rsquo;re feeding like Charlie won&rsquo;t eat</p><p>his whole bowl if he&rsquo;s not into it but</p><p>if you kept feeding him all day long</p><p>he&rsquo;d keep eating and keep eating at it</p><p>look at dogs that eat all day like that</p><p>I know look at look at animals that are</p><p>it&rsquo;s the same with people I hear you</p><p>can&rsquo;t hear me are you picking up what</p><p>I&rsquo;m throwing yes I am Karen are you</p><p>catching what I&rsquo;m tossing no but I want</p><p>to go to Joshua right now</p><p>been waiting patiently from thanks Joe</p><p>Castro Valley California go ahead you</p><p>had a question</p><p>yeah well I have an eye on your own time</p><p>in minute busting Wow um my question is</p><p>and I in any economy okay</p><p>laughs the only no other times upon your</p><p>own of 1024 they want to know yeah I</p><p>keep on going to pay that I get my um my</p><p>weight down yeah</p><p>so you weigh 98 pounds Joshua no Allah</p><p>no you lost okay</p><p>and you want any you want to lose any</p><p>more weight yeah you okay so let me just</p><p>give you that answer right now because</p><p>it&rsquo;s a little bit difficult to hear you</p><p>the more weight you want to lose the</p><p>less frequent you want to eat one meal</p><p>that it would be great but I do</p><p>understand when you actually do more in</p><p>a minute fasting and guess what uric</p><p>acid goes up why because it&rsquo;s an</p><p>antioxidant but it&rsquo;s only an antioxidant</p><p>in your blood it&rsquo;s a pro-oxidant inside</p><p>of cells which means it could send your</p><p>big toe it can hurt and get into me and</p><p>hurt so with gout there&rsquo;s a simple thing</p><p>to do and then there&rsquo;s some kind of a</p><p>correction to do if you if you just</p><p>slightly alkalize the body with either</p><p>potassium citrate or lemon juice now</p><p>you&rsquo;re probably saying wait a second I</p><p>thought lemon juice was acidic it is but</p><p>as soon as it breaks down your body</p><p>it turns alkalyn and so it will make it</p><p>can give people a lot of relief because</p><p>it counters the acidic nature of the</p><p>uric acid</p><p>so that should put that thing in</p><p>remission the problem is if you have</p><p>osteoarthritis you don&rsquo;t want to do</p><p>lemon juice because that can flare it up</p><p>so I will do a video on that just to</p><p>clarify that but but I&rsquo;m for you you</p><p>need to do a lot of lemon juice and</p><p>probably potassium citrate and do one</p><p>mill in a day to actually counter this</p><p>gout because it&rsquo;s you know gout really</p><p>comes from it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really kind of a</p><p>kidney problem because the body&rsquo;s the</p><p>kidney is not eliminating it so it could</p><p>be past damage from the kidney it could</p><p>be high fructose corn syrup it could be</p><p>certain organ meats but could be</p><p>chocolate things like that but typically</p><p>it&rsquo;s the inability of you to get rid of</p><p>uric acid because the kidney is not</p><p>doing like it should</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that you could</p><p>take to help yourself one is a lignin</p><p>them another is zinc but I would</p><p>definitely start chowing down and</p><p>drinking down that lemon juice like</p><p>probably a cup a day and then keep your</p><p>your body slightly alkaline alright</p><p>good question Karen yeah here&rsquo;s an</p><p>interesting question I think it&rsquo;s yeah</p><p>nunya business this is why I don&rsquo;t tell</p><p>people&rsquo;s names it&rsquo;s why some dude on</p><p>YouTube says you know</p><p>I kind of like that though but anyway I</p><p>mean I would like to answer this</p><p>question but it&rsquo;s nunya business know</p><p>I&rsquo;ll ask the question anyway what</p><p>happens to the fat cell when you gain</p><p>and lose weight do you know well it</p><p>expands and contracts Karen but is it</p><p>more susceptible to accumulating mass or</p><p>is it just this thing that expands and</p><p>contracts is there well I&rsquo;m sure damage</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure you would agree that it&rsquo;s very</p><p>very easy to lose weight and it&rsquo;s hard</p><p>to gain weight right like why are people</p><p>gain weight so easily but it&rsquo;s so hard</p><p>to lose it that&rsquo;s the real question okay</p><p>well does that have anything to do with</p><p>the cell itself I guess would be the</p><p>answer to nunya business yes it does it</p><p>does the cell has a goal of surviving so</p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t like to lose anything</p><p>likes to hold down the stuff because</p><p>it&rsquo;s the survivalist threatened when you</p><p>actually lose weight so and then the</p><p>more fat that you burn or the least</p><p>amount of fat you burn is related just a</p><p>really one thing and that is like how</p><p>much insulin resistance you have if you</p><p>have if your insulin is good and you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have a history of creating insulin</p><p>resistance and your blood sugars are</p><p>great you can oxidize or break down fat</p><p>really easy if you have insulin</p><p>resistance it&rsquo;s going to be more</p><p>difficult it does take time to fix</p><p>instant resistance sometimes up to two</p><p>or three years but as far as the fat</p><p>cell that&rsquo;s where the insulin resistance</p><p>is located many times in the fat cell so</p><p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re dealing with is that</p><p>the history of how many times you you</p><p>know ate carbs and then also the history</p><p>of how many times you died that extreme</p><p>weight loss</p><p>yeah absolutions yeah an unhealthy type</p><p>but even then if you do keto</p><p>intermittent fasting you go for the goal</p><p>of fixing an insulin resistance you will</p><p>eventually we establish a good</p><p>metabolism which that&rsquo;s a video coming</p><p>up mm-hmm</p><p>okay and none your business be nice now</p><p>I just took your question okay now I had</p><p>a another question here but I got</p><p>distracted by this okay I&rsquo;ll tell you</p><p>what you take a question and I&rsquo;ll come</p><p>back up with my ID when you&rsquo;re from</p><p>Philadelphia Pennsylvania you had a</p><p>question about hypoglycemia go ahead yes</p><p>uh good morning dr. Berg and Karen it&rsquo;s</p><p>an honor to talk to you both so I have a</p><p>question regarding this condition I&rsquo;m</p><p>not sure if I really had it I started</p><p>being a keto and intermittent fasting</p><p>after this happened about a year ago in</p><p>December basically after taking some</p><p>theraflu you know in the nighttime</p><p>severe cold type of medicine I got this</p><p>really bad panic attack I don&rsquo;t know</p><p>we&rsquo;re just I took it seemed a half an</p><p>hour later I was about to fall asleep</p><p>and had a panic attack it went away I a</p><p>week later exactly the same another</p><p>panic attack happened all also around</p><p>the time that I was like either fallen</p><p>asleep or halfway asleep and and it came</p><p>and then it went away okay then exactly</p><p>a week later the same thing happened and</p><p>but this time the third one was the</p><p>worst because my body ever since that</p><p>third panic attack stayed with a tension</p><p>headaches so a spin tension headaches</p><p>tightness in my head ever since then</p><p>that hasn&rsquo;t gone away and that&rsquo;s one of</p><p>the reasons I started listening to you I</p><p>got myself in Quito and is and I&rsquo;ve</p><p>improved but I&rsquo;m trying to figure out if</p><p>before I started doing the Quito and I F</p><p>could I have had some sort of following</p><p>my adrenals or hypoglycemia that when I</p><p>took this medicine it just turned like a</p><p>switch that got me into some anxious</p><p>mode and yeah I can&rsquo;t really get get out</p><p>of okay so this is what I would do it</p><p>when I would just take that product</p><p>separate all the ingredients do research</p><p>and every single ingredient just for the</p><p>for the viewpoint of the side effects</p><p>from those ingredients to see if that</p><p>would be one of them and also to see</p><p>what nutrients they deplete that would</p><p>be what I would do and chances are it&rsquo;s</p><p>going to be probably depleting b1 is</p><p>going to be the big one if you were to</p><p>take vitamin b1 and some good amount of</p><p>nutritional yeast that usually helps</p><p>panic attacks greatly but it sounds like</p><p>it did something to the adrenals I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know if it&rsquo;s hypoglycemia but I do</p><p>understand that</p><p>who knows what some of the medications I</p><p>mean I remember a long time ago I had a</p><p>job that I had to work third shift at a</p><p>newspaper facility I was stuffing</p><p>newspapers whatever and I remember being</p><p>so tired I was taking</p><p>I had the sleep real fast and then I had</p><p>to wake up so I took a similar thing</p><p>some night time it was pure sugar</p><p>and you just wake up feeling so groggy</p><p>and tired so I don&rsquo;t I know there&rsquo;s some</p><p>stuff in there that&rsquo;s not that great but</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would do</p><p>b1 is what you need to do Edwin thanks</p><p>for your call all right are you ready</p><p>for another question or do you want me</p><p>to go to another class of what go to go</p><p>one Gary and then I got it okay</p><p>Daryl you&rsquo;re from North Carolina and you</p><p>had a question go ahead yes I got into a</p><p>pan of lost almost sixty pounds and 2016</p><p>I said starting septic there&rsquo;s like big</p><p>Aikido and I went from 348 down to 313</p><p>good job and I&rsquo;m starting to - thank you</p><p>I&rsquo;m starting to plateau and I was trying</p><p>to figure out should I go to Oman and</p><p>should that be for morning or lunch got</p><p>it good question</p><p>all right Daryl I think you definitely</p><p>do all mad if if you&rsquo;re finding that</p><p>you&rsquo;re over the age of 25 I&rsquo;m getting</p><p>older I&rsquo;m being sarcastic and you have a</p><p>weight enough to way to lose you need to</p><p>be doing Oh mad for sure make sure it&rsquo;s</p><p>a healthy version as far as the timing</p><p>goes I would plant by here I would</p><p>recommend probably later in the day like</p><p>let&rsquo;s say you ate around 6:00 or between</p><p>4 and maybe even 7 I think that would be</p><p>best</p><p>when you when your system is kind of</p><p>towards the night time later in the day</p><p>the parasympathetic nervous system which</p><p>is the rest and digest kicks in and</p><p>you&rsquo;ll have a little bit of digestion so</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I would do but but you can</p><p>also do it earlier go with how whenever</p><p>you&rsquo;re hungry I do have people that are</p><p>doing what&rsquo;s called one meal every other</p><p>day which is extensive</p><p>you for that I&rsquo;m gonna make one but the</p><p>point is that they they need that extra</p><p>help with more fasting and they do they</p><p>thrive on that homie oh so you might</p><p>want to even look at that at some point</p><p>if you want to lose some faster weight</p><p>but it all depends on where your</p><p>metabolism is but just make sure that</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing it with enough nutrients as</p><p>well and one last thing Darrell I wanted</p><p>to mention that I&rsquo;m going to zip it calm</p><p>when you&rsquo;re fasting you are eating okay</p><p>your cells are eating your own fat it&rsquo;s</p><p>not that you&rsquo;re not being well nourished</p><p>you are being all nervous because you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating your own fat your reserves people</p><p>people don&rsquo;t like to start in the</p><p>fasting because if they gamma I&rsquo;m not</p><p>gonna eat no no you are eating it takes</p><p>like three days to convert but you&rsquo;re</p><p>eating when you&rsquo;re not eating does that</p><p>make sense makes sense Darrell thanks</p><p>for your question and now we&rsquo;re gonna go</p><p>to Karen okay good here&rsquo;s my favorite</p><p>question of the day how can i get a flat</p><p>stomach if I was sitting here right now</p><p>who doesn&rsquo;t want a flat stomach you have</p><p>a flat stomach okay this is what you do</p><p>you get an iron no you do a lot of</p><p>sit-ups no it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just your stomach</p><p>is a reflection of insulin resistance</p><p>and how much insulin is going on in your</p><p>body so it&rsquo;s very simple don&rsquo;t focus on</p><p>your stomach focus on lowering your</p><p>insulin how do you do that well watch my</p><p>videos you want to cut the carbs down as</p><p>low as possible there&rsquo;s actually a</p><p>really cool program it&rsquo;s actually on the</p><p>website but don&rsquo;t quote me but I know</p><p>it&rsquo;s on YouTube</p><p>it&rsquo;s called keto on steroids yeah and</p><p>that is an extreme version of keto and</p><p>you can watch that video and if you did</p><p>that video over a period of time you</p><p>will get a flat stomach I promise and I</p><p>will Garrett give you a guarantee as</p><p>well or your money back</p><p>your money back oh that&rsquo;s right it was</p><p>free but that&rsquo;s also for anybody who&rsquo;s</p><p>asking these Plateau questions there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot of videos on Plateau but that&rsquo;s a</p><p>great one and we hear great feedback</p><p>from</p><p>people who&rsquo;ve been plateaued doing that</p><p>extreme Kido you don&rsquo;t steroids</p><p>keto on steroids it is extreme it&rsquo;s</p><p>extreme but you know what if you&rsquo;re if</p><p>you want to get results who cares if</p><p>it&rsquo;s extremely hard who cares</p><p>him by the way nobody said it was gonna</p><p>be easy right</p><p>except this lady that did a video on how</p><p>she lost hundreds of pounds and turned</p><p>her entire life around she&rsquo;s like this</p><p>is the easiest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done it</p><p>really is we promoted that video last</p><p>week I forget what it is so don&rsquo;t ask me</p><p>now but she&rsquo;s a success story video I</p><p>think the hard thing is just the</p><p>transition part once I mean like kind of</p><p>getting used to it but once you&rsquo;re into</p><p>it the food is great all you guys are on</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not</p><p>starving you&rsquo;re not hungry</p><p>and the other thing is I think what</p><p>people come up with a lot is just the</p><p>social thing like I had that for a while</p><p>where oh you know I can&rsquo;t have dinner</p><p>with my family or I can&rsquo;t go to lunch</p><p>with so-and-so and that&rsquo;s just baloney</p><p>because you just changed your schedule</p><p>or you know what right now most of the</p><p>time I&rsquo;m um I try to go for eating one</p><p>time a day sometimes they eat twice a</p><p>day yeah deal I bet you there&rsquo;s been</p><p>days where I&rsquo;ve eaten three times what</p><p>you didn&rsquo;t tell me about that it can</p><p>happen but you know it&rsquo;s key know it&rsquo;s</p><p>good food you know so you have to do it</p><p>on a gradient you have to work it into</p><p>your life and I was gonna say where&rsquo;s</p><p>the book so for people who are new or</p><p>for people who still have questions oh</p><p>this is a great this is the cliff notes</p><p>this is the cliff notes this one
