    <p>Hi friends! So for this episode, I want to talk about some of the things that I&rsquo;ve recently realized when it comes to making changes and changing your life.</p>
<p>And everything that has to do with that. And y&rsquo;all, it&rsquo;s fucking annoying. I&rsquo;m just going to let you know.</p>
<p>Like, what I&rsquo;ve been realizing the past couple of days, week, two weeks, is a lot to take in.</p>
<p>And of course, what am I going to do when I realize some new shit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make myself be the only one dealing with it. I&rsquo;m going to throw it at y&rsquo;all too.</p>
<p>Now we all get to suffer. Now we all get to have this awareness and not know what the fuck to do about it.</p>
<p>Not really. This is just going to be really good stuff and things that are going to help you make changes if you want to make changes.</p>
<p>And if you feel like changes aren&rsquo;t happening, this is how to make them start happening.</p>
<p>And if you want a different life, this is the shit you need to know.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking like major life changes, even though I&rsquo;m about to run away.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m about to do a major life change and abandon my full life. But, this stuff can be used for everything.</p>
<p>So I have no plan for this episode. I&rsquo;m going to just shoot my shit and just see where it leads me.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to start off talking about this big realization I had when I hit 300,000 followers on TikTok.</p>
<p>I woke up and I saw that I had 300,000 followers. And I was like, cool.</p>
<p>Like, I really just didn&rsquo;t give a shit. Like, I just genuinely couldn&rsquo;t have cared less.</p>
<p>And I was like, mmm, something&rsquo;s off. Like, why do I not give a fuck?</p>
<p>Like, this is huge. This is like a big thing. And why am I not excited?</p>
<p>Like, I wasn&rsquo;t mad at myself for not being excited. I just looked at myself and I was like, hang on.</p>
<p>So why am I not excited? Why do I not seem to give a fuck? And why do I feel numb?</p>
<p>Like, I felt just very numb to it. I&rsquo;m like, okay, cool. It&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s 300,000 followers on that account. Cool.</p>
<p>Like, I just am very, like, unimpressed. And I really, it wasn&rsquo;t that I was unimpressed.</p>
<p>I more just felt numb to it. And it&rsquo;s cool that I have them, but I don&rsquo;t care if I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know? Girl, I do care now. After I got through my shit.</p>
<p>I am excited. I am, like, happy about it.</p>
<p>But coming up against these feelings, or lack of feelings, when I should have been excited or felt something at least, you know?</p>
<p>Brought me to the realization and had me come face to fucking face with some shit.</p>
<p>My life is the same. Like, my life has not changed at all.</p>
<p>And typically with social media fame and shit, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Anytime growing up, I would watch people on YouTube or I would watch anyone that had a lot of followers.</p>
<p>If you watched them from the beginning, their entire life would change.</p>
<p>Like, they would start making a lot of money. They would move away.</p>
<p>They would start doing other shit. They would start hanging out with other people that were, like, bigger.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay. So it just set up this weird expectation in my brain.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make fun of me, okay? Don&rsquo;t make fucking fun of me.</p>
<p>Because I know what I&rsquo;m going to say is going to sound really fucking stupid.</p>
<p>But there was just this little expectation in my brain that I didn&rsquo;t realize was like a set expectation where</p>
<p>when someone has followers, their life changes.</p>
<p>When someone has followers, these changes come along with that.</p>
<p>Like, I just thought it was part of the fucking package.</p>
<p>So I still remember hitting 100,000 followers.</p>
<p>And it was New Year&rsquo;s that I hit it for New Year&rsquo;s 2022.</p>
<p>I was just like, okay, like, yay, cool.</p>
<p>Like, maybe it&rsquo;ll start doing something now.</p>
<p>Like, I felt like 100,000 was a good milestone.</p>
<p>And then I hit 200,000.</p>
<p>And I was like, why am I not, like, that excited?</p>
<p>And then I hit 300,000. And now I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck.</p>
<p>And the whole reason I was, like, void of emotion toward it is because nothing was changing.</p>
<p>Nothing in my life fucking changed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had a number on an app that said you have a lot of followers.</p>
<p>And when I would go out in public, people recognized me now.</p>
<p>And people say hi to me. And I have little friends everywhere, which is nice.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t see and haven&rsquo;t seen any of the other benefits that come with the typical gaining followers thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s no real point.</p>
<p>Like, I was looking at it like, okay, followers for what?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another thing that was really frustrating was that I&rsquo;ve seen people with less followers than me make a lot of fucking money,</p>
<p>have a lot of fucking brand deals, have a lot of shit happening for them and changing for them.</p>
<p>And I started to, like, look around and be like, okay, these people have half the followers that I do.</p>
<p>They get a quarter of the views that I do.</p>
<p>Why the fuck are they getting all this shit and I am not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I started looking into getting brand deals and trying to reach out to brands.</p>
<p>And it just wasn&rsquo;t fucking working. It didn&rsquo;t work. It didn&rsquo;t go good.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any brands I gave a fuck about enough to, like, rep their shit.</p>
<p>Like, I found a lot of, like, booty ass brands that were like, oh, I&rsquo;ll send you stuff for free promo.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, bitch, my follower count is past the point of, like, sending me free shit for a post.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, now you gotta start paying for a post.</p>
<p>Because if I&rsquo;m advertising to hundreds of thousands of people, that ain&rsquo;t free.</p>
<p>Like, I can&rsquo;t rip myself off.</p>
<p>Like, I have to understand what I have is, like, monetizable.</p>
<p>But I really didn&rsquo;t put that much effort into it.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t find anybody that I was like, okay, this could be a thing.</p>
<p>So I just kind of quit when I had around 200,000 followers.</p>
<p>Like, I just stopped trying to reach out to brands. I stopped giving a fuck.</p>
<p>I was not seeing the benefits of having followers. I just had followers.</p>
<p>So when I realized I didn&rsquo;t feel anything toward gaining new followers, that was wise.</p>
<p>Because for fucking what?</p>
<p>Like, if I&rsquo;m not getting anything for it, it literally just is a number on a fucking screen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally starting to see a little bit of something.</p>
<p>Because the coaching thing is, like, starting to pick up.</p>
<p>Like, a lot of people have already scheduled so far, and I&rsquo;ve done a few calls, and I&rsquo;m like, whoa.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m starting to see changes.</p>
<p>But the thing that made me make all these changes was not seeing any fucking benefit.</p>
<p>So I literally had to face the realization of, like, nothing in my life has changed,</p>
<p>so why do I give a fuck about my follower count?</p>
<p>But then I was like, alright, fucker, take responsibility.</p>
<p>What have you done to change your life?</p>
<p>You know? And that&rsquo;s what fully, like, brought me into where I am now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, god damn it.</p>
<p>So, like, don&rsquo;t just expect your life to change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>Even if you gain 300,000 followers, your life&rsquo;s not gonna change until you change it.</p>
<p>And that made me really fucking upset.</p>
<p>Really, I really, really did.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve lived a lot of my life feeling powerless to being able to change my life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always just kind of, like, subconsciously hoped that getting followers would change my life for me.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>No, bitch. I&rsquo;m over here and I have to fucking do it.</p>
<p>And my life is only changing right now because I&rsquo;ve started changing it.</p>
<p>Like, you have to put deliberate action into changing your life or changing something if you want to change it.</p>
<p>And that was my full, like, come apart I had with that.</p>
<p>And it fucking just, ugh, like, it just irks the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Because I can see logically now it doesn&rsquo;t make sense,</p>
<p>but I can see how I was hopeful before and why I wanted something to just change my life.</p>
<p>Like, when you feel powerless and you feel like you can&rsquo;t change anything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna shoot for shit that you think will help you change it or change it for you.</p>
<p>So it made sense, the beliefs I was operating from and the hope that I had.</p>
<p>But I got to a point where outside shit wasn&rsquo;t helping, so I had to face the fact that I&rsquo;m the one in control.</p>
<p>And then I started making the changes.</p>
<p>And now, oh my god, guess what? My life is changing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my first point for this episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you want to change, you gotta be the one to fucking do it.</p>
<p>And I know everybody says that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna get a little more in-depth and give you some more advice,</p>
<p>not just some cookie-cutter bullshit like that.</p>
<p>And nothing&rsquo;s gonna come save you.</p>
<p>Like, I hoped social media would save me. It didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It literally fucking didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It made me feel worse about where I was at.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m like, goddammit, why is it not working?</p>
<p>And instead of questioning myself and my own value and being like,</p>
<p>why am I not good enough?</p>
<p>Why is it happening for everybody else and not me?</p>
<p>I looked for my power in the situation instead of looking for how I was not good enough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what led me to seeing the things that were in my control</p>
<p>and now taking control of them and creating the changes I wanted.</p>
<p>So in the process of making my changes that I&rsquo;ve been making to my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of things piss me the fuck off.</p>
<p>And a lot of those things are morning routines.</p>
<p>In daily routines.</p>
<p>Like the shit that you see on TikTok and you see all over social media.</p>
<p>Like people glorifying their morning routine.</p>
<p>Like they wake up, they read a book, they meditate, they drink lemon water,</p>
<p>they go on a walk, they have a nice hearty breakfast with like 45 fucking ingredients.</p>
<p>Like these people glorify the living shit out of drinking some fucking water</p>
<p>and waking up in the morning.</p>
<p>Like girl, why y&rsquo;all doing so goddamn much?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why social media has made it seem so productive to simply survive.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking get it.</p>
<p>But that was my problem is I was doing all this shit</p>
<p>and I thought that by living healthy that I was like accomplishing something.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t accomplishing shit toward the goals I actually had</p>
<p>and the changes I actually wanted to make.</p>
<p>Like I was doing so many things in the day</p>
<p>that were actually not producing an outcome for the changes I wanted to see.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really my first tip.</p>
<p>My biggest fucking tip if you want to make a change,</p>
<p>look at your like daily actions you take</p>
<p>and get very clear on the direct actions you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>to create the changes that you want to make.</p>
<p>So whatever your goal is, look at the actions you&rsquo;re taking daily.</p>
<p>And as soon as you do this, you&rsquo;re going to realize</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even doing like a quarter of what you thought you were doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not actually being a quarter of as productive</p>
<p>as you thought you were being toward achieving your goal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing so much other fluffy bullshit</p>
<p>that everybody is making seem like cool.</p>
<p>Like going to the gym is not like an accomplishment to me anymore</p>
<p>because yeah, I want to look a certain way.</p>
<p>I want to stay healthy. Great.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not going to help me move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to help me make an income.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to help me change my fucking life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally just maintenance of my human body</p>
<p>to not die and to look cute.</p>
<p>Like eating, drinking fucking water, sleeping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just basic survival to me.</p>
<p>Hygiene, I don&rsquo;t look at that as being productive anymore.</p>
<p>Because I used to put that shit on my to-do list.</p>
<p>Like, oh, it&rsquo;s all over my to-do list.</p>
<p>My to-do list is fucking huge.</p>
<p>But when I looked at my to-do list after I had this new mindset,</p>
<p>I was like, girl, you ain&rsquo;t actually doing shit to get toward your goals.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re doing all this fluff and it&rsquo;s making you feel productive.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not actually being productive</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not actually moving toward your goal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just doing a bunch of shit.</p>
<p>So I had to get very clear on what I was actually doing</p>
<p>for the goal I wanted to achieve.</p>
<p>And by realizing all this other shit that I was doing</p>
<p>that took up space and took time away</p>
<p>from what I actually could be doing to work on things</p>
<p>became very clear and I started knocking that shit out.</p>
<p>Like eating, I don&rsquo;t make eating a big deal.</p>
<p>I meal prep, I have my meals, I fucking eat them and I keep going.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of other things I&rsquo;ve done to simplify my life.</p>
<p>I still make sure I get everything done I need to get done</p>
<p>for my life and surviving as a human. I get it.</p>
<p>We have certain things we want to do, of course.</p>
<p>Make time for it, do it, get it done.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t look at that as being productive.</p>
<p>So what I had to do is completely change my mindset</p>
<p>where basic survival I no longer perceive</p>
<p>and I no longer look at as being productive.</p>
<p>So if something is just considered surviving,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t make it seem like it&rsquo;s productive.</p>
<p>I just make that a given.</p>
<p>I make that my baseline expectation</p>
<p>of what I expect myself to do for myself as a living human being.</p>
<p>So doing that leaves me at the end of the day</p>
<p>with an urge to do more, to accomplish more</p>
<p>and to know and be aware</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually doing shit toward my goals.</p>
<p>So if I want to actually create change,</p>
<p>I need to make a whole other list</p>
<p>of all the things that I could be doing</p>
<p>to work toward whatever it is I want to work toward.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m going to feel more confident that changes are coming</p>
<p>because I can clearly see the impact they&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>But when you just have a long list of shit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not mentally clear about what&rsquo;s accomplishing what,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel very productive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel like you have a lot of things to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be overwhelmed. You&rsquo;re going to feel tired.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not going to see results</p>
<p>because all that shit&rsquo;s lost in translation, basically.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really big step</p>
<p>is knock out all this glamorization of basic survival</p>
<p>and human shit.</p>
<p>Like, people, I swear to God, y&rsquo;all,</p>
<p>these TikToks piss me off.</p>
<p>The shit that people post online</p>
<p>of their daily routines is honestly</p>
<p>my version of fucking hell.</p>
<p>Like, them being up in the Skyrise apartments</p>
<p>with the perfect fucking, like,</p>
<p>furniture and the perfect bed</p>
<p>and the nice city view</p>
<p>and they go to the perfect gym</p>
<p>and their perfect little outfit</p>
<p>and nothing is dirty and everything is just perfect.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s my personal version of fucking hell</p>
<p>with their lemon water.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but waking up in the morning and drinking hot lemon water</p>
<p>is like drinking stomach acid.</p>
<p>Fuck that shit. I&rsquo;ll do cold water.</p>
<p>If I have the energy to throw the lemon in it,</p>
<p>I will. But fuck a lemon.</p>
<p>Like, girl, I&rsquo;m busy.</p>
<p>Let me hit my water, my vitamins, and let me go brush my teeth</p>
<p>and fucking get on with my goddamn day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to cut up no fucking lemon and boil some water.</p>
<p>Like, girl, I have shit to do.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s my version of fucking hell.</p>
<p>Like, the perfect life in the Skyrise apartment</p>
<p>and, like, having the Tesla</p>
<p>and going to the perfect gym</p>
<p>and, like, all your appearances.</p>
<p>Like, ugh. Like, the whole living perfectly like that</p>
<p>makes me fucking cringe.</p>
<p>Like, I hate it.</p>
<p>Like, when I move into my fucking apartment in Houston,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally gonna have a mattress on the floor</p>
<p>and, like, no fucking furniture. I don&rsquo;t want shit.</p>
<p>Like, I can afford to buy it.</p>
<p>Like, I have my savings. I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>I can afford to buy furniture and shit. I just don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Like, I want it to look a little grunge.</p>
<p>I want it to look a little, like, real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it to look fake</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m living in a fucking prop studio.</p>
<p>I genuinely have no urge to buy shit.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck.</p>
<p>Like, I want a fake plant.</p>
<p>I want a mattress on the floor.</p>
<p>Maybe a couch and maybe some bar stools.</p>
<p>But, girl, with my kitchen appliances,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna splurge as fuck.</p>
<p>Air fryer, Keurig, goddamn Dyson vacuum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have all the nice shit.</p>
<p>Like, anything I need, I&rsquo;m gonna buy it.</p>
<p>But when it comes to, like, decorating the furniture</p>
<p>and making things look pretty, eh, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I want it to be functional.</p>
<p>And a mattress on the floor is just fucking fine.</p>
<p>I have a weird obsession with that.</p>
<p>Like, I just want my mattress on the fucking floor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just something about it that, like,</p>
<p>ugh, like, I just don&rsquo;t have to take life seriously.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go run and jump on my fucking mattress on the floor.</p>
<p>Like, I grew up living on pallets.</p>
<p>Like, my grandmother used to always make me pallets in the living room.</p>
<p>And, like, I would just live on the pallet.</p>
<p>And, like, I would just hang out on it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s my adult version of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mattress on the floor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I fucking love it. And everything white.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s gonna be fucking white if I&rsquo;m allowed to paint it.</p>
<p>But, I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Okay, let me stop talking about all that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a whole bunch we don&rsquo;t need to hear.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m not someone that&rsquo;s okay with, like,</p>
<p>wanting something</p>
<p>and not feeling like I&rsquo;m working toward it.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not able to just set a goal</p>
<p>out in the future</p>
<p>and then just not take actions to it.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad these type people</p>
<p>have the time in the day</p>
<p>to make these fucking videos</p>
<p>making their morning routine look like the most</p>
<p>special and aesthetic thing in the world.</p>
<p>Cool. Good for you.</p>
<p>But, we&rsquo;re the consumer of these videos.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the viewers.</p>
<p>So, I want to make sure that your brain</p>
<p>is not getting fucked up in this.</p>
<p>Doing the pretty shit, making your morning routine</p>
<p>look pretty, it might not actually</p>
<p>be productive. It might be, though.</p>
<p>So, if you want to</p>
<p>continue doing whatever you&rsquo;re doing, do it.</p>
<p>But, become aware of what&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>going to get you toward your goals or not.</p>
<p>Because, at the end of the day, you want to be able</p>
<p>to feel good and feel like you&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>toward your goals. That&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>thing, is accountability</p>
<p>and reassurance</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re making a difference in your</p>
<p>life. That&rsquo;s a big thing for me.</p>
<p>And, of course, this can be taken into, like, the toxic</p>
<p>ass hustle culture shit.</p>
<p>But, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about. The people that listen to my podcast,</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all fucking get it. You&rsquo;re aware</p>
<p>enough to not be fucking stupid and</p>
<p>work yourself into the ground. So, even if</p>
<p>you want to do that, do it, bitch.</p>
<p>Humans are capable of handling</p>
<p>so much more than we think. Okay?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not as fucking fragile. And, like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to be babied as much</p>
<p>as people think. Like, what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to create and do</p>
<p>as a physical human, you could probably</p>
<p>do ten times what you think you&rsquo;re capable of.</p>
<p>And, that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>But, I really, like, sound like one of them</p>
<p>preachy fucking assholes right now. Like,</p>
<p>you just gotta work. You just gotta fucking</p>
<p>grind, bro. Like, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not talking about that, y&rsquo;all. I promise. I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>get accountable and get</p>
<p>realistic with what you&rsquo;re doing. Like,</p>
<p>see the reality of the way you&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>for the truth of it. Like,</p>
<p>see what is actually going on. And,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re confused why you&rsquo;re not achieving shit,</p>
<p>look at what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to work toward it.</p>
<p>But, my next tip with all this is</p>
<p>when you make the list of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do daily,</p>
<p>make a list of actions</p>
<p>you can take. Because</p>
<p>human beings are conscious</p>
<p>creators. We are here on this</p>
<p>earth to create.</p>
<p>If you are not creating shit</p>
<p>and creating change</p>
<p>and causing, like, ripples</p>
<p>in, like, the water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, like, not</p>
<p>fucking fulfilling what you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to be doing. Like, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here for. People get fucked up</p>
<p>when they try to suppress and do</p>
<p>not act on their creative ability</p>
<p>and their creative, like, what&rsquo;s it called?</p>
<p>Energy. Like, we&rsquo;re meant to create.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not meant to fucking manifest. Shut up</p>
<p>with the whole manifestation shit and get</p>
<p>based in real life for a second.</p>
<p>And, like, look at what you&rsquo;re doing everyday</p>
<p>to create what you want. So,</p>
<p>make a list of things you can do</p>
<p>daily to help create</p>
<p>and bring about what it is you want.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re meant to create it.</p>
<p>Not mindlessly just think happy</p>
<p>thoughts and manifest it.</p>
<p>Not fucking air quotes around</p>
<p>manifest. I don&rsquo;t like that whole idea</p>
<p>of it. I used to be very into it,</p>
<p>but it just made me fucking lazy and hopeful</p>
<p>and let me down because nothing was fucking working.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re meant to create</p>
<p>it. We&rsquo;re meant to do it. Not</p>
<p>think about it and envision it</p>
<p>and picture it and buy crystals.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, all those things are great, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not it.</p>
<p>The biggest part of it is conscious</p>
<p>action and conscious creation.</p>
<p>So, yeah,</p>
<p>make your list of action steps that you can do</p>
<p>so that you can also reassure yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I use these lists for. I&rsquo;m a very</p>
<p>big, like, list maker.</p>
<p>Because I can look at it and reassure</p>
<p>myself, okay, this is fine. Because when I get</p>
<p>emotional and upset, it&rsquo;s hard to think</p>
<p>logically. So, if you can have something</p>
<p>in front of you, like a notebook or something</p>
<p>written on paper, it&rsquo;s sitting in front of you.</p>
<p>You can look at it, even when you&rsquo;re emotional</p>
<p>and reassure yourself. There&rsquo;s no fighting it.</p>
<p>Like, if the actions are directly going to get</p>
<p>you where you want to go, and you&rsquo;re upset,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re feeling like you&rsquo;re not doing enough,</p>
<p>you can clearly look at the paper and reassure yourself</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing great. You&rsquo;re doing fine.</p>
<p>Okay? Now cool it. Cry,</p>
<p>let it out, and then fucking get it together.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m gonna take a</p>
<p>second to get off, like, the fucking preachy</p>
<p>shit and get into, like, the emotional</p>
<p>side of it and believing</p>
<p>in yourself that you are able</p>
<p>to make a change or to change</p>
<p>your life. So, if</p>
<p>you were like me in the beginning of this, when I was</p>
<p>talking about how I was, where I felt</p>
<p>powerless to make changes in my life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to do something drastic</p>
<p>to prove</p>
<p>to yourself you do have control</p>
<p>over things. You do have control over your</p>
<p>life. You can at any moment</p>
<p>choose to do whatever you fucking want.</p>
<p>And that is so</p>
<p>important. If you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re able to make a change,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t feel like something is in your control,</p>
<p>it is very important to you</p>
<p>for you to do something big</p>
<p>to disrupt shit, to show</p>
<p>hey, I can</p>
<p>create change. You need to prove that to</p>
<p>yourself. So, I don&rsquo;t care what</p>
<p>it is, but that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s really big, is, like, to create</p>
<p>a shift from hell. Like, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m running away and changing my life right now.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m literally running away to Houston soon,</p>
<p>and when this episode releases, I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>in Houston looking at apartments. I&rsquo;m recording this</p>
<p>early, before Sunday.</p>
<p>But, I need to prove to myself</p>
<p>I can create a change.</p>
<p>A big part</p>
<p>of that, because a lot of people are like, financially</p>
<p>they let things hold them back.</p>
<p>So, you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>make a change where you need to risk</p>
<p>finances, but I did, because</p>
<p>I kept telling myself,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;ll move once I can make</p>
<p>$5,000 a month</p>
<p>relatively passively, or I can figure</p>
<p>out something that I can do, and make at least</p>
<p>$5,000 a month. That&rsquo;s what I would feel comfortable</p>
<p>moving out and living normal with.</p>
<p>So, I was telling myself, until</p>
<p>I can make $5,000 a month, I&rsquo;m not moving.</p>
<p>And, that&rsquo;s why I have not moved</p>
<p>for the last year, because I&rsquo;ve been wanting to</p>
<p>move since May of 2021.</p>
<p>But, trying to live like that</p>
<p>like, beat me down.</p>
<p>And it pushed me up against the fucking wall of</p>
<p>powerlessness, because I was like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to create</p>
<p>this amount of money for myself</p>
<p>without being fucking miserable.</p>
<p>So, I was looking at it like,</p>
<p>if I want to move out,</p>
<p>I have to go work a fucking</p>
<p>job I hate, in order</p>
<p>to make the money. So, what</p>
<p>I told myself was,</p>
<p>fuck the money. Like, I&rsquo;m now at a</p>
<p>point where I was up against the wall</p>
<p>of such deep hopelessness.</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck about</p>
<p>the money anymore. I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>allow the money to keep me trapped</p>
<p>and make it be justification</p>
<p>for why I can&rsquo;t leave. I need</p>
<p>to feel like I can change my life. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fucking do it. I&rsquo;m moving.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at a place where I&rsquo;m so fucking</p>
<p>hopeless, I don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna fucking just move, and I will</p>
<p>figure the fuck out. But I&rsquo;m proving to</p>
<p>myself, I can make a fucking change</p>
<p>and I can change my life.</p>
<p>And a big thing that that came from</p>
<p>was from starting</p>
<p>to care about the way that I feel.</p>
<p>So, I preach that in all my episodes, and I will preach</p>
<p>it forever, until the fucking day I die.</p>
<p>Caring how I feel</p>
<p>is what has led me</p>
<p>here, to finally have the courage to say</p>
<p>fuck it, I don&rsquo;t care. Because</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>do not enjoy my life.</p>
<p>I am not okay with living the life</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m living right now. I no longer want</p>
<p>to live it. So,</p>
<p>I look at the way that I&rsquo;m feeling, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take myself into consideration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to care</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m unhappy with my life.</p>
<p>And do what I can to get myself out of it.</p>
<p>And do what I can to change it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna make</p>
<p>myself try to become okay</p>
<p>with living a life I don&rsquo;t wanna live.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my biggest point with this podcast</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>do not try to make yourself become</p>
<p>okay with something you&rsquo;re not okay with.</p>
<p>Put your energy instead</p>
<p>into trying to change it</p>
<p>or flip it.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to become okay</p>
<p>with living here and living at home with my dad</p>
<p>and living in Pensacola, but</p>
<p>I keep coming up against the same</p>
<p>wall of hopelessness, but this time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m approaching it differently. I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>trying to make myself become</p>
<p>okay because I have an easy life here</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t pay rent. I can live for fucking free</p>
<p>with my dad and everything&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I can logically see</p>
<p>how anyone else in my position would be</p>
<p>happy to have this, but</p>
<p>for me personally, I want more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I want, but I know I want</p>
<p>more. I want different. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay. It doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to make sense to anybody else. It doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>have to make sense to me. All I have</p>
<p>to fucking do is follow the way that I feel about</p>
<p>it. If it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking like it and I&rsquo;m not happy being</p>
<p>here, I&rsquo;m going to say, okay</p>
<p>me, scoop myself up and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go make a fucking change. I&rsquo;m getting the</p>
<p>fuck out of here. I&rsquo;m not going to try</p>
<p>to force myself to stay here where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unhappy and force myself to stay</p>
<p>somewhere I&rsquo;m not okay.</p>
<p>Mentally, this place is fucking</p>
<p>killing me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many reasons I want to move to a bigger city</p>
<p>and get the fuck out of this place,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not really the point of this episode.</p>
<p>So my</p>
<p>whole spiel came to that</p>
<p>with caring about</p>
<p>the way that you feel. And if you&rsquo;re uncomfortable,</p>
<p>caring that you&rsquo;re uncomfortable</p>
<p>and caring that you&rsquo;re unhappy</p>
<p>and caring that you wake up every</p>
<p>day feeling fucking hopeless.</p>
<p>Okay. I only let that last for</p>
<p>three days. Like I hit this one wall</p>
<p>of hopelessness like last week</p>
<p>and I thought it would just</p>
<p>like go away or I thought I could kick it</p>
<p>or I thought I could continue</p>
<p>with like doing my lives and</p>
<p>helping people and I just, it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go away. That lingering just like hopelessness</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go away and it was stronger than ever.</p>
<p>And times before</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>as strong as I am now to handle it.</p>
<p>I know where it led me and it led me</p>
<p>to a very very bad</p>
<p>fucking place multiple times.</p>
<p>So this time I completely</p>
<p>changed my approach to it.</p>
<p>And this time</p>
<p>I actually care about how I feel</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to prioritize how I feel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting myself</p>
<p>go through that. I&rsquo;m not letting that fucking</p>
<p>shit happen to me anymore. I&rsquo;m not letting</p>
<p>myself stay here.</p>
<p>And I care about myself and the way</p>
<p>that I feel more than I care about</p>
<p>potentially not having money</p>
<p>to pay my fucking bills. Like I have a credit card.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in credit card debt, but I&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>it fucking work. I&rsquo;ll go bartend if I have to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go back to nursing. I literally</p>
<p>will figure it the fuck out. But all I know</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>I gotta prioritize me.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really gonna help all of you</p>
<p>make a change is when you shift</p>
<p>your energy from making</p>
<p>yourself feel comfortable with something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not comfortable with into</p>
<p>looking for the ways you can change it and bring about</p>
<p>change. Like that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>completely flip everything.</p>
<p>And I never thought I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>make it out of here. I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>be really honest. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;d ever make it out.</p>
<p>And this is the mindset shift</p>
<p>that has made it</p>
<p>possible and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually getting out. So</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure I shared</p>
<p>it because this is the most</p>
<p>life-changing thing that I&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>experienced.</p>
<p>One more thing I</p>
<p>want to ramble about off the</p>
<p>emotional track is</p>
<p>consistency. So</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make a change or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try to do something different and you&rsquo;re gonna change</p>
<p>your daily routine, set a time</p>
<p>limit. Set a date for how long you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>do it first. Like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really, really important fucking thing. Alright?</p>
<p>I promise. I know it sounds a little nuts</p>
<p>but as long as there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an end date for when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna stop doing the things you&rsquo;re doing, it helps</p>
<p>you do them longer. It helps you</p>
<p>do them better. Okay? And it helps</p>
<p>you feel like a little bit more hopeful. So if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna do these action</p>
<p>steps every day for the next 30 days</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna see how my life changes and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make a whole new list of what I&rsquo;m gonna start doing.</p>
<p>Give yourself the</p>
<p>30 days or 60 days or however long you</p>
<p>want it to be. And then work</p>
<p>toward it and do it for those 60 days.</p>
<p>Commit to that time frame</p>
<p>and then you can reassess</p>
<p>and change what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. But when you&rsquo;re trying to make a change</p>
<p>and you keep fucking switching directions</p>
<p>every 3-4 days or every week</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to do new shit, it&rsquo;s like, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Just do what you said you were gonna do</p>
<p>for the time limit that you</p>
<p>set and then keep</p>
<p>going. Because you have to do things consistently</p>
<p>to see, like, improvements</p>
<p>or changes. You know, you can&rsquo;t just do something</p>
<p>once and be like, oh, all good. Like, where&rsquo;s the change at?</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s something drastic</p>
<p>or like, you get what I fucking mean. It&rsquo;s not like cutting your hair</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like you cut it once and it&rsquo;s cut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, working out.</p>
<p>You gotta fucking keep going. It sucks.</p>
<p>And I fucking hate it. But I love it at the same time.</p>
<p>But I do want to</p>
<p>tell you that the confidence</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>like, genuine</p>
<p>happiness you will feel</p>
<p>when you show yourself</p>
<p>that you do have control over</p>
<p>things and you can and will</p>
<p>change your reality.</p>
<p>Bitch. It&rsquo;s like, the best</p>
<p>feeling I&rsquo;ve ever felt. And</p>
<p>I literally fucking like, bawled my eyes</p>
<p>out about it like an hour and a half before I</p>
<p>recorded this. Like, I was supposed to record this earlier</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m about to be late to my haircut.</p>
<p>But, girl, I just had to fucking let it</p>
<p>out. Like, I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying.</p>
<p>Like, I was just so happy. Like, genuinely</p>
<p>just so fucking happy</p>
<p>and proud of myself and I felt</p>
<p>supported in a way I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never felt supported before because I had</p>
<p>my back. I wasn&rsquo;t gonna let</p>
<p>myself stay here</p>
<p>and be upset anymore. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I had my own back</p>
<p>and the more that I&rsquo;m exposing</p>
<p>to myself that I can create changes,</p>
<p>the more that I&rsquo;m trusting myself</p>
<p>and believing that I&rsquo;m in good hands.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like I&rsquo;m in good hands with myself</p>
<p>because, like, I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>what it fucking takes and I&rsquo;ll make it work.</p>
<p>And feeling safe</p>
<p>with yourself is</p>
<p>shit. I can&rsquo;t fucking describe a single</p>
<p>thing that feels better. Like, I would rather</p>
<p>feel safe with myself</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>have ten million dollars.</p>
<p>Honest to fucking God. Because feeling</p>
<p>unsafe with yourself, nothing is worth that.</p>
<p>Nothing is fucking worth that. And money can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>buy that. You have to build that. You have to create that.</p>
<p>You have to show yourself that you have your own fucking back</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna let yourself be miserable.</p>
<p>I hope after listening to this episode</p>
<p>you feel a little bit better about whatever</p>
<p>change you&rsquo;re trying to make. I hope you feel</p>
<p>inspired. I hope you feel prepared and ready</p>
<p>and, like, hopeful a little bit.</p>
<p>But I really just wanted to make sure</p>
<p>I shared all this with you guys. Because it</p>
<p>really helped me and I think it will really help you.</p>
<p>If you like this podcast</p>
<p>I just have one request and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that you go leave me a five star rating.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>If you want to keep up with me, all of my social media</p>
<p>will be linked in the description of this podcast.</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested</p>
<p>in one-on-one coaching with me,</p>
<p>I have now created an application</p>
<p>process so it&rsquo;s no longer just free to</p>
<p>schedule. I&rsquo;m doing applications</p>
<p>now to keep up with the demand because it</p>
<p>just got too high. So now I&rsquo;m screening people</p>
<p>basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s not. Because I want to work</p>
<p>with action takers. I want to work</p>
<p>with people that are serious about transforming</p>
<p>their life. Because the shit that I say</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all know. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>And where I specialize</p>
<p>is with the people that have been</p>
<p>looking for answers they can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>and the people that have been trying shit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in that, I will put the link to the</p>
<p>application in the description box also.</p>
<p>And I want to make it very clear</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>got what it takes to get through</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re dealing with or to improve your life</p>
<p>or to reach your goals. And I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help you see that. And it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot</p>
<p>easier when you got me in your corner.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s exactly how I want it to feel.</p>
<p>I want it to feel like you have someone that has your back</p>
<p>and like I&rsquo;m in your corner. Cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it is. Like I&rsquo;m there for you and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>there to do shit with you.</p>
<p>But anyways, thank you so much for</p>
<p>listening. Please stay safe</p>
<p>and take care of yourself. And I will talk</p>
<p>to you next Sunday.</p>
