    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to your Thursday therapy session and a place to dump all of your petty grievances</p>
<p>with myself, Jennifer, and the star of our show, our shining bright little diamond, Pumps.</p>
<p>I almost think you might be just a little bit twerked about that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so fun to say, and the star of our show, our bright, shiny little diamond.</p>
<p>Zip it.</p>
<p>Zip it.</p>
<p>But you are the star of our show and my very best friend and one of my favorite people</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Now, you know that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very, very, very true.</p>
<p>So, listener, this is one of our favorite things to do is to get these voice memos from</p>
<p>you because there&rsquo;s a lot of material out there and we only have those Tuesday episodes</p>
<p>to dive into with a guest, but there is a lot of stuff that needs to be addressed in</p>
<p>these therapy sessions that we have.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let&rsquo;s have Kylie start us off with our first contestant.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The first one just goes by Aunt Baby.</p>
<p>Aunt Baby.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>This is a good one.</p>
<p>I have two, but I&rsquo;ll make them quick and, you know, do what you will.</p>
<p>The first one is when you pay for your goddamn fucking plane ticket.</p>
<p>You pay for the seat by the window.</p>
<p>You pay for the extra leg room.</p>
<p>You pay just to have that little tiny, itty, bitty, shitty bit of luxury that is left when</p>
<p>flying through our friendly skies.</p>
<p>And some chode or some dickhead comes up to you and says, excuse me, can we switch seats?</p>
<p>This is my little Braxton, Jackson, McKaylee, Kinsey, fucker, child wants to sit and watch</p>
<p>the clouds.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, Sharon or Karen, you cannot.</p>
<p>Your child, your precious little snowflake has to sit her ass down in the seat that you</p>
<p>bought for her because you weren&rsquo;t savvy enough to book your fucking ticket earlier, like</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>So, there.</p>
<p>My name is Julia.</p>
<p>Love Julia.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Aunt Baby Julia, that is some high quality.</p>
<p>Five gold star.</p>
<p>That is excellent.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to tell you a story that&rsquo;s very similar.</p>
<p>The kids and Josh and I were flying to Europe and we have, Roman and I have seats next to</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>And at the time, Roman was probably nine years old.</p>
<p>And so, we have these two middle seats.</p>
<p>And then there is a couple that they&rsquo;re probably in their late forties, early fifties.</p>
<p>And they ask Roman if he can move somewhere so that they can sit by each other.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I literally look at them, I&rsquo;m like, well, you know, it&rsquo;s like a 10 hour flight and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my child.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s nine.</p>
<p>So, I think I&rsquo;m going to sit with him.</p>
<p>And like, Josh was sitting with Dylan.</p>
<p>Well, then they start, they keep asking the people.</p>
<p>Because they wanted to sit by each other.</p>
<p>They finally get together.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I hate them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re total dicks.</p>
<p>Total dicks.</p>
<p>And they end up, they are the hand holders, the entire flights.</p>
<p>Which means they immediately broke up the minute they landed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it was over the top.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re like PDAing all the way to Europe.</p>
<p>PDAing the whole way.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;d get up and go to the restroom, I would look at them and they are like, literally</p>
<p>twister the game.</p>
<p>Where they&rsquo;re just all twisted up together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just thinking, why do you have to cuddle like this on an airplane?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, if they loved each other so much, why didn&rsquo;t they buy seats together?</p>
<p>Like Julia says, buy your tickets, assign your seats.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t like all of the fuckery that goes on after you have gone onto the World</p>
<p>Wide Web and selected your very own seat.</p>
<p>You almost like visually can picture it.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m going to be by the window on the left side of the plane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lean my head over.</p>
<p>And then somebody comes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always some skunk at the garden party that has to come shit on your parade.</p>
<p>And then they drag the kid into it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, I am happy to move though for two kids to sit together.</p>
<p>I mean, a mom and a kid to sit together.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m flying somewhere by myself and somebody, I&rsquo;m happy to do that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I could never in a million years imagine someone asking a child to move so they could</p>
<p>sit by their significant other.</p>
<p>I was so shocked that they asked.</p>
<p>And I kind of looked at them and were like, we&rsquo;re together.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is my child.</p>
<p>Who gives a shit if you&rsquo;re together?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Fucking grow up and go sit in your fucking seat.</p>
<p>I hate them.</p>
<p>No, they were awful.</p>
<p>Good one, Julia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>Lots, lots of fuckery going on.</p>
<p>Lots in this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Friendly skies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The next one is Hbriggs13 on Instagram.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Heather.</p>
<p>And I have had it with random people from high school using social media to sell their</p>
<p>pyramid scheme products.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to buy your shakes, your oils, your shampoo, your magic coffee, or your meal</p>
<p>plan where ground beef on bell peppers counts as nachos.</p>
<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t want to join your bootcamp challenge.</p>
<p>These people never come out and say what they&rsquo;re selling.</p>
<p>They like to be vague and brag about how they used to be bald, overweight and constipated.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to the nameless miracle, they have thick hair, toned bodies and take large</p>
<p>satisfying shits every day.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a hashtag girl boss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking advantage of your friends and family to sell shit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Heather, this is something that we are 100% on board with you and it&rsquo;s called forced capitalism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do a whole episode about it because it is so rampant and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Forced capitalism is a huge fucking problem.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>It is a huge problem where people force the capitalism upon you and that is what your</p>
<p>high school friends are doing to you.</p>
<p>This is similar to the kiosks in the mall.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just walking down the mall and next thing you know, people are spraying shit on</p>
<p>you, rubbing lotion on your hands and you didn&rsquo;t choose to go in that store because</p>
<p>the kiosk is out in the public part of the mall.</p>
<p>And so if you go into Banana Republic and there&rsquo;s an overzealous saleswoman, you can</p>
<p>just hightail it right on out of there.</p>
<p>It is awful.</p>
<p>The worst is in your home where a friend invites you to a party and they&rsquo;re selling shit at</p>
<p>the party so you feel like you can&rsquo;t leave unless you buy something.</p>
<p>Do you remember that time when our kids, remember when we sent our kids to that Jewish</p>
<p>preschool because we had great hours?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We loved that little school.</p>
<p>Anyway, this mom called me and she&rsquo;s like, Hey Jennifer, this is blank and I have this</p>
<p>great opportunity for you.</p>
<p>And I was like, Oh, okay.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking she&rsquo;s going to have a great babysitter for you that I want to share or whatever.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I sell Arbonne and I think that you would be phenomenal at selling Arbonne.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t want to sell it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have any part of it.</p>
<p>She gets so mad at me and she keeps going on, you would be so good at it.</p>
<p>You need to do this.</p>
<p>And I was like, I don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how good at it I would be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to buy it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No part of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to use it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sell it.</p>
<p>And I want to cease talking to you about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how over the whole thing.</p>
<p>To this day when I see her, she is still super icy to me because I did not want to sell Arbonne</p>
<p>and she needs to be stopped.</p>
<p>This is why Heather sent a voice memo to a podcast DM because what happened to me did</p>
<p>not happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Anyway, I agree with you, Heather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem and Congress needs to act.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long list of things that need to be taken care of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably in the top 10 for sure.</p>
<p>Maybe we could start a super PAC.</p>
<p>Say no to forced capitalism.</p>
<p>Okay, Kylie, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Up next we&rsquo;ve got Demi W. Okay, Demi.</p>
<p>I have had it with listening to Jennifer talk about pickleball.</p>
<p>So I was curious and put it in my search bar on TikTok.</p>
<p>Now every other video is about pickleball.</p>
<p>I fucking have it.</p>
<p>Fucking love Demi.</p>
<p>She is speaking my language like you have a rare talent that any subject I could say</p>
<p>my dog died and you say, well, pickleball, I mean, there&rsquo;s no pickleball reference that</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t bring in unnecessarily.</p>
<p>So Demi, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Lover.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>She Googled it on TikTok and now it&rsquo;s every other video that just fucking sucks.</p>
<p>Your phone is just not your friend sometimes.</p>
<p>So Demi, I would apologize to you, but that would take a big person and we all know how</p>
<p>petty you are.</p>
<p>I am a very small little person and I love pickleball and I&rsquo;m secretly so happy that</p>
<p>in your ugly thoughts towards me that you&rsquo;re now being tormented and stalked by the algorithm.</p>
<p>So anyway, don&rsquo;t hate the player, Demi, don&rsquo;t hate the player.</p>
<p>She hates the player and the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I can see why people will have had it with me over pickleball, but I&rsquo;m going to tell</p>
<p>everybody this.</p>
<p>Pickleball has been something that brought out something better in me.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>You are such a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to have a manifesto.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all clear.</p>
<p>You love pickleball.</p>
<p>Oh, listen, I&rsquo;m going to say something really sweet.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why are you being such a bitch?</p>
<p>Because Kylie and I caught eyes when you started in on your pickleball and I&rsquo;m just like, here</p>
<p>we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to tell you this.</p>
<p>I had a no new friend policy for many years.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know that.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>A very stern.</p>
<p>Very strict.</p>
<p>No new friend policy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I was just trying to shed friends.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And make my world even smaller.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I have met the most wonderful, awesome people that I now play pickleball with.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s making me a kinder, gentler person that has more friends in their life.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going crazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start crying all the time or anything like that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to cry and post it on the internet.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to, you know, no, I&rsquo;m not going to cry and post it on the fucking</p>
<p>internet.</p>
<p>People do.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Fuck you, Demi.</p>
<p>Fuck you, Pumps.</p>
<p>And fuck you, Kylie.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I want Demi to know that.</p>
<p>That also has happened to me since I started working here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And my phone&rsquo;s near you at all times.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I scroll and it&rsquo;s like by this pickleball racket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting pickleball accessories, clothes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pickleball by proxy.</p>
<p>Pickleball adjacent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Pickleball adjacent.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And the last one is Allison M. Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with these yak mouth grocery store clerks making a comment on every fucking</p>
<p>thing on the conveyor belt.</p>
<p>Oh, have you tried these?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve been wanting these.</p>
<p>These sound good.</p>
<p>These are my favorite.</p>
<p>Oh, someone&rsquo;s having a party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming home with you.</p>
<p>Just keep it moving and put the shit in the bag.</p>
<p>I got things to do.</p>
<p>Could not agree more.</p>
<p>Could not agree more.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that is it&rsquo;s like judgment and they do it.</p>
<p>Like I maybe I am having some people over or maybe I just feel like eating a bunch of</p>
<p>shit today.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, I totally get the judgment thing.</p>
<p>Like if you have a bunch of like snacks, right?</p>
<p>Like little kid snacks or sweets or oh, well, you&rsquo;re not worried about gluten or something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nobody asked you to comment on my grocery order.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I completely agree.</p>
<p>Or like when you&rsquo;re buying a bunch of alcohol, I&rsquo;ve heard that, you know, now they have in</p>
<p>Oklahoma, it&rsquo;s very new that they sell liquor in grocery stores.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard somebody be like, oh, well, this is a lot of liquor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sure you can handle all this?</p>
<p>Like why are you making a comment about how much wine she&rsquo;s buying?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s none of your fucking business.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She wants to sit in the parking lot and drink till she passes out and call an Uber.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s her business.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like all of the extra yak mouthing.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>I absolutely despise it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough when they say, did you find everything okay?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not going to go, you know, I really was looking for these cotton balls,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>I always say, yep, I did.</p>
<p>Even if I spent 30 minutes looking for something, I&rsquo;m like, yep.</p>
<p>No, it is at waiters that talk too much.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Nothing can ruin a nice dinner more than a waiter that thinks they&rsquo;re part of the party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too much.</p>
<p>Josh and I were in London once and this waiter just, I mean, he just yacked and yacked.</p>
<p>You completely ruined our lunch.</p>
<p>It will ruin your whole thing.</p>
<p>We were dining alfresco.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, sunny September day in London and this fucking yak mouth waiter just</p>
<p>starts in.</p>
<p>He starts in.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an expert on everything.</p>
<p>You know, then he starts telling, he&rsquo;s an expert on the United States of America, even</p>
<p>though he&rsquo;s not American.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, here&rsquo;s the deal, buddy.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear this.</p>
<p>I want to eat lunch with my husband, not with you.</p>
<p>It was never ending.</p>
<p>We liked the food so much.</p>
<p>We thought about going back the next day because Josh and I will do that if we like a restaurant.</p>
<p>No, because of him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I think the grocery store is what we&rsquo;re learning on this podcast is just a minefield.</p>
<p>The grocery store is a huge, huge problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got cart abusers.</p>
<p>People that whip out their vacation photos.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something that happened to me at the grocery store.</p>
<p>This was about three years ago.</p>
<p>So I was really into the, or am into those, you know, the reusable bags so you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to have it in plastic bags.</p>
<p>You know, you have your own little grocery bags.</p>
<p>Bring your own grocery bags.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I had a set of about five that were fantastic and they were kind of big.</p>
<p>Everything could fit in them perfectly.</p>
<p>So I get my grocery cart and I put my bags that I brought from my groceries to be bagged</p>
<p>in underneath my cart, like on that lower shelf of the cart.</p>
<p>So I go to checkout at the checkout counter and I get down to get my bags and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not there.</p>
<p>And I was like, I swear to God, I had my bags here.</p>
<p>Hang on one second.</p>
<p>Keep checking, you know, keep scanning all this stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go scan the aisles that must have fallen out.</p>
<p>So as I go to start scanning the aisles, two rows down, there is a woman who has every,</p>
<p>all five of my bags.</p>
<p>And so I say to her, hey, those are my bags.</p>
<p>They fell out of my cart.</p>
<p>I need them back.</p>
<p>And she goes, no, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And I go, yes, they are.</p>
<p>And she goes, I brought these.</p>
<p>And I go, you realize there&rsquo;s about 9,500 video cameras above us, right?</p>
<p>So do you want to go down this road with me?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to give me my fucking bags back.</p>
<p>And she was like, well, I, and I was like, and the guy, the manager, like sees the whole</p>
<p>thing go down because there&rsquo;s nothing worse than a liar doubled down on the stolen bag.</p>
<p>If she just would have said, oh my God, I saw them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>Here they go.</p>
<p>But she lied and said that she brought them, you know, grocery stores have all the video</p>
<p>cameras.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the manager sees that, like, it&rsquo;s escalating, might have a little desktop here.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to give you all new bags.</p>
<p>And I was like, I kind of want those bags.</p>
<p>I want those bags.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re being just a touch petulant.</p>
<p>Because I took the high road always was gracious.</p>
<p>So you let her keep the bag.</p>
<p>I just, I, I mean, I didn&rsquo;t want people again.</p>
<p>I took into account that people waiting in line, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to go in.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be the problem at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Like this fucking liar, lying liar was, she stole my bags and then lied about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s bad, awful.</p>
<p>I mean, stealing and doubling down on the, on the Reese, I&rsquo;m trying to be a good ambassador</p>
<p>to the planet with my bags.</p>
<p>And I get dicked over by the lying liar who lies a lot.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Who stole my grocery bags.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>What a bitch.</p>
<p>What a bitch.</p>
<p>We hate her.</p>
<p>Tough had it with her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Alice in the grocery stores are a problem.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>From fellow consumers.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you something that really, really, really, really, really bugs the shit out of</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I mean, from top to bottom, couples that grocery shop together and hold hands while it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>inefficient.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, there are a lot of romantic places on the planet.</p>
<p>A grocery store is not one.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s go in, get your shit, pay for your shit, get the fuck out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a browsing thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I cannot imagine why you would take your spouse.</p>
<p>Josh and I have gone to the grocery store together.</p>
<p>I would say divide and conquer.</p>
<p>We divide and conquer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>One hand is on a cart.</p>
<p>The other hand is holding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no excuse for it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what the venue is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an aisle.</p>
<p>It could be a fucking Walgreens.</p>
<p>People have to pass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still had it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Too much.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, listener, thank you for joining.</p>
<p>Do you feel better?</p>
<p>I feel better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel better.</p>
<p>We got a lot off our chest.</p>
<p>A lot off our chest.</p>
<p>And listener, we hope you have too.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get it twisted.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get it twisted for a second.</p>
<p>Because we have had it with a lot of things.</p>
<p>And we have it out in these therapy sessions.</p>
<p>And then we go out in the world and feign happiness and grace and dignity and respect</p>
<p>for others.</p>
<p>And we encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>But join us when, Pumps?</p>
<p>Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p>We will see you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Or Thursday.</p>
<p>Or both.</p>
<p>DM us some more voice memos.</p>
<p>Pumps, you nailed that closing.</p>
<p>Did I mess it up?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You nailed it a hard time.</p>
<p>The entry clap you&rsquo;re getting really good at.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m fading at the end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fading at the end.</p>
<p>Fading.</p>
<p>The sorority voice comes out.</p>
<p>Or both.</p>
<p>Or both.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just follow us.</p>
<p>Like us.</p>
<p>Like me more than her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
