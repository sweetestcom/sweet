    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the neuroscience of fear.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about trauma</p>
<p>and post-traumatic stress disorders.</p>
<p>The neuroscience of fear has a long history in biology</p>
<p>and in the field of psychology.</p>
<p>However, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that in the last 10 years</p>
<p>the field of neuroscience has shed light</p>
<p>on not just the neural circuits,</p>
<p>meaning the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that control the fear response and the ways that it does it,</p>
<p>but some important ways to extinguish fears</p>
<p>using behavioral therapies, drug therapies,</p>
<p>and what we call brain-machine interfaces.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about all of those,</p>
<p>and you are going to come away</p>
<p>with both an understanding of the biology of fear</p>
<p>and trauma, as well as many practical tools</p>
<p>to confront fear and trauma.</p>
<p>In fact, we are going to discuss</p>
<p>one very recently published study</p>
<p>in which five minutes a day of deliberate exposure to stress</p>
<p>was shown to alleviate longstanding depressive</p>
<p>and fear-related symptoms.</p>
<p>We will get into the details of that study</p>
<p>and the protocol that emerges from that study</p>
<p>a little later in the podcast,</p>
<p>but it stands as a really important,</p>
<p>somewhat counterintuitive example</p>
<p>of how stress itself can be used to combat fear.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of where we are going,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just lay out the framework for today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m going to teach you</p>
<p>about the biology of fear and trauma,</p>
<p>literally the cells and circuits</p>
<p>and connections in the body and chemicals in the body</p>
<p>that give rise to the so-called fear response,</p>
<p>and why sometimes, but not always,</p>
<p>fear can turn into trauma.</p>
<p>I will also describe the biology of how fear is unlearned</p>
<p>or what we call extinguished.</p>
<p>And there too, you&rsquo;re going to get some serious surprises.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn, for instance,</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t just eliminate fears,</p>
<p>we actually have to replace fears with a new positive event.</p>
<p>And again, there are tools with which to do that,</p>
<p>and I will teach you those tools today.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>So what is fear?</p>
<p>Well, fear falls into a category</p>
<p>of nervous system phenomenon</p>
<p>that we can reliably call an emotion,</p>
<p>and it is hotly debated nowadays,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been hotly debated really for centuries</p>
<p>what an emotion is and what an emotion isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not a debate that I want to get into today.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that emotions include responses</p>
<p>within our body, quickening of heart rate,</p>
<p>changes in blood flow,</p>
<p>things that we experience as a warming</p>
<p>or a cooling of our skin,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s also a cognitive component.</p>
<p>There are thoughts, there are memories,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of stuff that goes on in our mind</p>
<p>and in our body that together we call an emotion.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a vast amount of interest</p>
<p>and literature devoted to trying to understand</p>
<p>how many different emotions there are,</p>
<p>how different people experience emotions,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s certainly a topic that we will embrace</p>
<p>in a future podcast episode.</p>
<p>But today, I just want to talk about fear as a response,</p>
<p>because when we talk about fear as a physiological response</p>
<p>and as a cognitive response,</p>
<p>then we can get down to some very concrete mechanisms</p>
<p>and some very concrete and practical tools</p>
<p>that can be used to deal with fear when fear is not wanted.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk first about what fear isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with stress,</p>
<p>both as a concept and as an experience.</p>
<p>Stress is a physiological response.</p>
<p>It involves quickening of the heart rate,</p>
<p>typically quickening of breathing,</p>
<p>blood flow getting shuttled to certain areas</p>
<p>of the brain and body and not to others.</p>
<p>It can create a hypervigilance or an awareness.</p>
<p>Typically that awareness is narrower,</p>
<p>literally narrower in space,</p>
<p>like a soda straw view of the world,</p>
<p>than when we are relaxed.</p>
<p>And it is fair to say that we cannot have fear</p>
<p>without having several,</p>
<p>if not all of the elements of the stress response.</p>
<p>However, we can have stress without having fear.</p>
<p>Likewise, people are familiar with the phrase</p>
<p>or the word rather, anxiety.</p>
<p>Anxiety tends to be stress about some future event,</p>
<p>although it can mean other things as well.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really have fear without seeing or observing</p>
<p>or experiencing some of the elements of anxiety,</p>
<p>but we can have anxiety without having fear.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re starting to realize is that fear is built up</p>
<p>from certain basic elements that include stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>And then there is trauma.</p>
<p>And trauma also requires a specific,</p>
<p>what we will call operational definition.</p>
<p>An operational definition is just a definition</p>
<p>that allows us to have a conversation</p>
<p>because we both agree on or mostly agree on</p>
<p>what the meaning of a given word is.</p>
<p>It makes conversations much easier.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue,</p>
<p>if we all had operational definitions</p>
<p>for more things in the world,</p>
<p>that there would be fewer misunderstandings and arguments,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d all move a lot further as a species.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another topic entirely.</p>
<p>The operational definition of trauma</p>
<p>is that some fear took place,</p>
<p>which of course includes stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>And that fear somehow gets embedded</p>
<p>or activated in our nervous system,</p>
<p>such that it shows up at times when it&rsquo;s maladaptive,</p>
<p>meaning that fear doesn&rsquo;t serve us well,</p>
<p>and it gets reactivated at various times.</p>
<p>Like when you first wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not in the presence of something that scared you,</p>
<p>but you suddenly have what feels like a panic attack</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in deep fear, well, that&rsquo;s post-traumatic stress.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s post-traumatic fear.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to get bogged down</p>
<p>too much in the nomenclature,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;m doing here is building up</p>
<p>a sort of a series of layers where stress and anxiety</p>
<p>form the foundation of what we&rsquo;re calling fear and trauma.</p>
<p>And then there are other phrases out there</p>
<p>that we would be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>things like phobias and panic attacks.</p>
<p>Panic attacks are the experience of extreme fear,</p>
<p>but without any fear-inducing stimulus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like trauma.</p>
<p>And a phobia tends to be extreme fear</p>
<p>of something specific, fear of spiders, fear of heights,</p>
<p>fear of flying, fear of dying, these kinds of things, okay?</p>
<p>The reason for laying all that out there</p>
<p>is not to create a word soup to confuse us,</p>
<p>rather it is to simplify the issue.</p>
<p>Because now that we acknowledge</p>
<p>that there are many different phrases</p>
<p>to describe this thing that we call fear</p>
<p>and in related phenomenon,</p>
<p>we can start to just focus on two of these issues,</p>
<p>fear and trauma,</p>
<p>as it relates to specific biological processes,</p>
<p>specific cognitive processes,</p>
<p>and we can start to dissect how fears are formed,</p>
<p>how fears are unformed,</p>
<p>and how new memories can come to replace</p>
<p>previously fearful experiences.</p>
<p>So in this effort to establish a common language</p>
<p>around fear and trauma,</p>
<p>I want to point out autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Autonomic arousal relates to this aspect</p>
<p>of our nervous system</p>
<p>that we call the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>Autonomic means automatic,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somewhat of a misnomer</p>
<p>because there are aspects of your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that you can control,</p>
<p>but your autonomic nervous system controls things</p>
<p>like digestion, urination, sexual behavior,</p>
<p>stress, when you want to be awake,</p>
<p>when you want to be asleep.</p>
<p>It basically has two branches to it,</p>
<p>two branches meaning two different systems.</p>
<p>One is the so-called sympathetic autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>has nothing to do with sympathy,</p>
<p>it has everything to do with increasing alertness.</p>
<p>Think of the sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>as the alertness nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what ramps up your levels of alertness,</p>
<p>ramps up your levels of vigilance.</p>
<p>Think about it as the accelerator</p>
<p>on your alertness and attention.</p>
<p>The other branch of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is the so-called parasympathetic branch</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a mouthful.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>are the cells and neurons and chemicals</p>
<p>and other aspects of your brain and body</p>
<p>that are involved in the calming nervous system.</p>
<p>So sympathetic is alerting, parasympathetic is calming,</p>
<p>and it acts as sort of a seesaw</p>
<p>to adjust your overall level of alertness.</p>
<p>So for instance, right now I&rsquo;m alert,</p>
<p>but I feel pretty calm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ready to go to sleep or anything like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I need a nap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m alert, but I&rsquo;m calm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in a state of stress or panic.</p>
<p>So that seesaw we could imagine is more or less level.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s tilted up a little bit</p>
<p>to the side of increased sympathetic or alertness</p>
<p>rather than parasympathetic because I feel wide awake.</p>
<p>If I were sleepy, the opposite would be true.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic side would be increased</p>
<p>relative to the sympathetic side.</p>
<p>There are many different aspects</p>
<p>to the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>but one of the main aspects is an aspect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to come up again and again and again today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that you understand what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the HPA axis.</p>
<p>The HPA axis stands for hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus is a collection of neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an area of your brain real estate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deep in the brain at the base of the brain</p>
<p>that contains many, many different areas</p>
<p>that control things like temperature</p>
<p>and desire to have sex, desire to eat, thirst.</p>
<p>It also controls the desire to not mate, have sex,</p>
<p>not eat, not drink more water or any other type of fluid.</p>
<p>So it has accelerators and brakes in there as well.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus connects to the so-called pituitary.</p>
<p>The pituitary lives close to the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>It releases hormones into your bloodstream.</p>
<p>And so the hypothalamus has this ability</p>
<p>to trigger the release or prevent the release</p>
<p>of particular hormones like cortisol</p>
<p>or the hormones that go stimulate ovaries to produce estrogen</p>
<p>or testes to produce testosterone</p>
<p>or adrenals to produce adrenaline.</p>
<p>And speaking of the adrenals,</p>
<p>that A in the HPA are the adrenals.</p>
<p>You have two glands that sit above your kidneys</p>
<p>in your lower back.</p>
<p>They receive signals by way of nerve cells, neurons,</p>
<p>and by way of hormones and other things</p>
<p>released from the brain and elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>And they release different hormones</p>
<p>and other types of chemicals into the body.</p>
<p>And the two main ones that you need to know about today</p>
<p>are adrenaline, also called epinephrine, and cortisol.</p>
<p>Both of those are so-called stress hormones,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not always involved in stress.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also involved in waking up in the morning</p>
<p>when you arise, when you, excuse me,</p>
<p>when you rise from sleep.</p>
<p>And so this HPA axis should be thought of</p>
<p>in the following way.</p>
<p>The HPA axis includes a piece of the brain,</p>
<p>the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a beautiful three-part system</p>
<p>that can use your brain to alert or wake up your body</p>
<p>and prepare it for action.</p>
<p>And it can do that in the short term</p>
<p>by triggering the release of hormones and chemicals</p>
<p>that make you alert and ready to go right away.</p>
<p>And by triggering the release of neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and hormones and other chemicals</p>
<p>that give that alertness a very long tail,</p>
<p>a very long latency before it shuts off.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important because one of the hallmarks of fear</p>
<p>and one of the hallmarks of trauma</p>
<p>is that they involve fear responses that are long lasting,</p>
<p>even if those fearful events,</p>
<p>the events in the world that trigger the HPA axis</p>
<p>can be very brief,</p>
<p>like a car that almost hits you as you step off the curb</p>
<p>or something, a gunshot that goes off suddenly,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a very quick,</p>
<p>like 500 millisecond or one second event.</p>
<p>The fear response can reverberate through your system</p>
<p>because the chemicals that are involved in this HPA axis</p>
<p>have a fast component and a longer lasting component.</p>
<p>And the longer lasting component can actually change</p>
<p>not just the connections of different areas of the brain</p>
<p>and the way that our organs work, like our heart</p>
<p>and the way that we breathe,</p>
<p>it actually can feed back to the brain</p>
<p>and literally control gene expression,</p>
<p>which can take many days and build out new circuits</p>
<p>and new chemicals that can embed fear in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And that might sound very depressing,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a reason and there&rsquo;s an adaptive reason</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s the slow and fast phase of the HPA axis</p>
<p>and the fear response.</p>
<p>And fortunately, that gene expression</p>
<p>and the long arc of the fear response,</p>
<p>the way it kind of lives in our system,</p>
<p>kind of like a phantom in some ways,</p>
<p>can also be leveraged to undo the fear response,</p>
<p>to extinguish the fear response</p>
<p>and replace it with non-fearful associations.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s dig a little deeper into the neural circuits</p>
<p>and biology of fear, because in doing that,</p>
<p>we can start to reveal the logic of how to attack fear</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really have a discussion about fear</p>
<p>without discussing the famous amygdala.</p>
<p>Famous because I think most people by now</p>
<p>have heard of the amygdala.</p>
<p>Amygdala means almond.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an almond shaped structure on both sides of the brain.</p>
<p>So you have one on the right side of your brain</p>
<p>and one on the left side of your brain.</p>
<p>The amygdala is part of what we can call the threat reflex.</p>
<p>And this is very important to conceptualize fear</p>
<p>as including a reflex.</p>
<p>So much as you have reflexes</p>
<p>that cause you to lift your foot up</p>
<p>if you are to step on something sharp,</p>
<p>you literally have a reflex within your spinal cord</p>
<p>that causes you to lift up one foot</p>
<p>and extend the other one toward the ground.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, you always think</p>
<p>that you step on something sharp, you pull your foot up,</p>
<p>but you actually step on something sharp,</p>
<p>you pull your foot up and in pulling it up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another reflex that&rsquo;s activated</p>
<p>that as you extend your other leg</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t fall over.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the process of experiencing fear,</p>
<p>you have a reflex for particular events</p>
<p>in your brain and body.</p>
<p>And that reflex involves things</p>
<p>like quickening of your heart rate, hypervigilance,</p>
<p>your attentional systems pop on,</p>
<p>increased ability to access energy stores</p>
<p>for movement and thought and so forth.</p>
<p>But just like that step on the tack reflex example,</p>
<p>all of the neural circuits that are associated</p>
<p>with being calm, with being able to go to sleep,</p>
<p>with being able to visualize the full picture</p>
<p>of your environment, literally,</p>
<p>to see your entire environment</p>
<p>or to hear other things around you,</p>
<p>all of those get shut down</p>
<p>when the so-called threat reflex gets activated.</p>
<p>And the amygdala is part of the threat reflex</p>
<p>so much so that we can really say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the final common pathway</p>
<p>through which the threat reflex flows.</p>
<p>In other words, the amygdala is essential</p>
<p>for the threat response.</p>
<p>But the threat reflex and the threat response</p>
<p>is kind of a dumb response.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a sophisticated thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very generic.</p>
<p>And this is also a very important point.</p>
<p>One of the beauties of the fear system</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very generalizable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not designed for you to be afraid of any one thing.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some debates</p>
<p>and probably some good data out there</p>
<p>that support the fact that human babies are innately,</p>
<p>meaning it requires no learning,</p>
<p>innately afraid of certain things</p>
<p>like heights or snakes or spiders.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s debate about this</p>
<p>depends on the quality of the experiment, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the real capacity of the fear system</p>
<p>is that we can become afraid of anything</p>
<p>provided that this threat system is activated</p>
<p>in conjunction with some external experience.</p>
<p>So the way I&rsquo;d like you to think about the amygdala</p>
<p>is not as a fear center,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s a critical component of the threat reflex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to also internalize the idea</p>
<p>that the threat reflex involves</p>
<p>this activation of certain systems</p>
<p>and suppression of all the systems for calming,</p>
<p>the parasympathetic system.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m going to describe the way</p>
<p>that information flows into and through this threat reflex.</p>
<p>And in doing that, it will reveal how specific things</p>
<p>like a spider, like a snake, like a physical trauma,</p>
<p>like a car accident, like a fear of public speaking,</p>
<p>whatever happens to scare you or scare somebody,</p>
<p>how that gets attached to this reflex.</p>
<p>Because this reflex is very generic.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really know what to be afraid of.</p>
<p>It only knows how to create the sensation,</p>
<p>this internal landscape that we think of as fear.</p>
<p>So while the amygdala might look like an almond,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually part of a much bigger complex</p>
<p>or collection of neurons called the amygdaloid complex.</p>
<p>That complex has anywhere from 12 to 14 areas,</p>
<p>depending on which neuroanatomist is naming things</p>
<p>and carving it up.</p>
<p>In neuroscience and in much of biology,</p>
<p>we like to joke that there are lumpers</p>
<p>and there are splitters.</p>
<p>So some people like to draw boundaries</p>
<p>between every little distinct difference and say,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s a separate area and other people are lumpers.</p>
<p>And they say, well, listen, why complicate things?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s lump those together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m neither a lumper nor a splitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhere in between.</p>
<p>I think the number 12 is a good number</p>
<p>in terms of the number of different areas of the amygdala.</p>
<p>Why is that important to us?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the amygdala</p>
<p>is not just a area for threat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an area for generating threat reflexes</p>
<p>that integrates lots of different types of information.</p>
<p>So for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you some names, some nomenclature.</p>
<p>For those of you that don&rsquo;t, you can tune out for this,</p>
<p>but basically information from our memory systems</p>
<p>like the hippocampus and from our sensory systems,</p>
<p>our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth, et cetera.</p>
<p>So taste information, vision, auditory information,</p>
<p>touch, et cetera,</p>
<p>flow into the so-called lateral portion of the amygdala,</p>
<p>flows into, or the amygdaloid complex.</p>
<p>It flows into the lateral portion.</p>
<p>And then there are multiple outputs from the amygdala.</p>
<p>And this is where things get particularly interesting</p>
<p>because the outputs of the amygdala</p>
<p>have a lot of different areas,</p>
<p>but there are two main pathways.</p>
<p>One involves the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which you heard about before,</p>
<p>this collection of neurons that control</p>
<p>a lot of our primitive drives for sex, for food,</p>
<p>for thirst, and for warmth, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it also feeds out to our adrenals,</p>
<p>those glands that you learned about a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>to create a sense of alertness and action.</p>
<p>It also feeds out, what I mean by feeds out, by the way,</p>
<p>is there are neurons that send wires,</p>
<p>we call those wires axons, connections,</p>
<p>where they can release chemicals</p>
<p>and trigger the activation of different brain areas.</p>
<p>So it feeds out to other brain areas, such as the PAG.</p>
<p>PAG is very interesting for our discussion today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the periaqueductal gray.</p>
<p>The periaqueductal gray contains neurons</p>
<p>that can trigger freezing, can trigger the,</p>
<p>some people talk about the fawning response,</p>
<p>which is kind of an appeasing response to traumatic events,</p>
<p>but some people outright freeze in response to fear, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard of fight or flight,</p>
<p>and indeed the pathway that I&rsquo;m describing</p>
<p>can create a sense of fight</p>
<p>and cause people to want to lean in in an aggressive way</p>
<p>to combat things that they&rsquo;re afraid of,</p>
<p>or flight, to run away,</p>
<p>essentially to avoid, by mobilizing,</p>
<p>the thing that they feel they&rsquo;re threatened by.</p>
<p>Now, even in the absence of some threat,</p>
<p>somebody that has, say, a fear of public speaking</p>
<p>might hesitate or move away from a podium,</p>
<p>or hesitate or move away from raising their hand,</p>
<p>if raising their hand meant that they might be called on</p>
<p>and would be public speaking.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s fight and flight,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the freeze response.</p>
<p>And the freeze response</p>
<p>is controlled by a number of brain centers,</p>
<p>but the periaqueductal grade, the PAG,</p>
<p>is central for this freeze response.</p>
<p>And neurons there also create</p>
<p>what are called endogenous opioids.</p>
<p>Many of you have heard of the opioid crisis,</p>
<p>which is a crisis of prescription medication</p>
<p>given out too broadly for people that don&rsquo;t need it,</p>
<p>who become addicted to opioids.</p>
<p>Those are exogenous opioids.</p>
<p>But endogenous opioids are chemicals released from neurons</p>
<p>in the PAG and from elsewhere in the body</p>
<p>that give us a sense of numbing.</p>
<p>They actually numb us against pain.</p>
<p>And you can imagine why biology would be organized this way.</p>
<p>A threat occurs or something that we perceive as a threat,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re afraid of it,</p>
<p>and a natural analgesic is released into our body</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s likely to be an interaction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very uncomfortable,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s physically uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like we have our own endogenous release</p>
<p>of these opioids, and that&rsquo;s occurring in the PAG.</p>
<p>The other area, and again,</p>
<p>sorry to litter the conversation</p>
<p>with these names of structures,</p>
<p>but some people seem to enjoy knowing these structures.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fine if you just understand what the structures do.</p>
<p>If you want to know the names, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But the other structure is the locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>The locus coeruleus creates a sense of arousal</p>
<p>by releasing adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>a related chemical into the brain.</p>
<p>So basically the activation of the amygdaloid complex</p>
<p>could be from any number of different things,</p>
<p>a memory of something fearful,</p>
<p>an actual sensory experience of something that&rsquo;s fearful.</p>
<p>But then the fear response itself</p>
<p>is taking part because of the threat reflex gets activated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s threat reflex,</p>
<p>then sends a whole set of other functions into action,</p>
<p>freezing, activation of the adrenals,</p>
<p>activation of locus coeruleus for arousal and alertness,</p>
<p>activation of this endogenous pain system</p>
<p>or anti-pain system in the PAG.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one pathway out of the amygdala.</p>
<p>The other pathway out of the amygdala</p>
<p>is to a very interesting area</p>
<p>that typically is associated with reward and even addiction.</p>
<p>So this might come as a surprise to many of you.</p>
<p>In fact, it came as a surprise to me.</p>
<p>I remember when these data were published,</p>
<p>but the amygdaloid complex actually projects</p>
<p>to areas of the dopamine system,</p>
<p>the so-called nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>the mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>For those of you that want to look that up</p>
<p>or that remember from the dopamine episodes,</p>
<p>we have pathways in our brain</p>
<p>that are associated with pursuit, motivation, and reward.</p>
<p>And the neuromodulator dopamine is largely responsible</p>
<p>for that feeling of craving, pursuit, and reward.</p>
<p>And this threat center is actually able to communicate with</p>
<p>and activate the dopamine system.</p>
<p>And later you will realize why that is very important</p>
<p>and why you can leverage the dopamine system</p>
<p>in order to wire in new memories to replace fearful ones.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been hitting you with a lot of names of things,</p>
<p>but for the moment,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re interested in all the neuroscience names</p>
<p>and structures and so forth,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to just conceptualize</p>
<p>that you have a circuit in your brain,</p>
<p>meaning a set of cells and connections</p>
<p>that are arranged in the following way.</p>
<p>You have a threat reflex that can be activated</p>
<p>at any time very easily.</p>
<p>But what activates that threat reflex</p>
<p>can depend on two things.</p>
<p>One are prior memories coming from brain areas</p>
<p>that are involved in storage of memories,</p>
<p>or it can be immediate experiences,</p>
<p>things that are happening in the now, okay?</p>
<p>So were something fearful to happen right now,</p>
<p>your threat reflex could be activated.</p>
<p>Were you to remember something very scary</p>
<p>that happened to you in the past,</p>
<p>your threat reflex could be activated.</p>
<p>And that threat reflex circuit has two major outputs.</p>
<p>One of the major outputs is to areas that are involved</p>
<p>in the threat response, freezing, pain management,</p>
<p>and alertness.</p>
<p>And the other major output is to areas involved in reward,</p>
<p>motivation, and reinforcement, okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fourth component,</p>
<p>and I promise this is the last component</p>
<p>that we need to put into this picture</p>
<p>of the neural circuits for fear.</p>
<p>And this is a circuit that involves an area of the brain</p>
<p>called the prefrontal cortex and some of its subdivisions.</p>
<p>So literally in the front,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s involved in what we call top-down processing.</p>
<p>Top-down processing is the way that your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and other areas of the brain can control</p>
<p>or suppress a reflex, okay?</p>
<p>A good example of this would be the step on the tack example</p>
<p>that I gave before.</p>
<p>So when you step on a tack,</p>
<p>you immediately pull up your foot</p>
<p>and you extend the other leg.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reflex that prevents you from injuring yourself</p>
<p>and from falling over.</p>
<p>However, if you wanted, not that you would want to,</p>
<p>but if you wanted, you could, for instance,</p>
<p>place your foot onto a tack</p>
<p>and decide not to pull your foot away.</p>
<p>It would be difficult.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t recommend that you do that,</p>
<p>but you could override that reflex, okay?</p>
<p>There are other examples of reflexes,</p>
<p>like for instance, getting into cold water.</p>
<p>Most people will start to, you know, huddle their body.</p>
<p>Most people won&rsquo;t want to get into the cold water.</p>
<p>Many people will jump out, but all of that is reflexive.</p>
<p>And should you want to,</p>
<p>you could override that reflex through top-down processing.</p>
<p>You could tell yourself,</p>
<p>oh, I heard on a previous Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>or on an Instagram post that cold water exposure</p>
<p>can be beneficial for metabolism and resilience, et cetera.</p>
<p>And indeed it can.</p>
<p>And you can decide to get into the water</p>
<p>and to stretch out your body, not to huddle.</p>
<p>And you can fight those reflexes, okay?</p>
<p>The fighting of reflex is carried out</p>
<p>through top-down processing,</p>
<p>largely through the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>You provide a narrative, you tell yourself,</p>
<p>I want to do this, or I should do this,</p>
<p>or even though I don&rsquo;t want to, I&rsquo;m going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>So top-down processing is not just</p>
<p>for getting into cold water,</p>
<p>and it certainly isn&rsquo;t for overriding reflexes</p>
<p>that can damage us, like a stepping on the tack example.</p>
<p>It is the way in which we can override</p>
<p>any number of internal reflexes,</p>
<p>including the threat reflex.</p>
<p>And the way that we do that is by giving a new story</p>
<p>or a new narrative to this experience that we call threat.</p>
<p>And you know the threat response.</p>
<p>The threat response is quickening of the heart rate,</p>
<p>quickening of the breathing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t generally like the feeling of adrenaline</p>
<p>in our system.</p>
<p>Some people are so-called adrenaline junkies,</p>
<p>and they get a mixture of dopamine and adrenaline</p>
<p>from certain high intensity events.</p>
<p>I confess in previous aspects of my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tended to like adrenaline.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was at the extreme of thrill-seeking,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m somebody that, for instance,</p>
<p>I tend to like roller coasters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done various things where I&rsquo;m familiar with</p>
<p>and I enjoy the sensation of adrenaline in my body,</p>
<p>but I enjoy it because of the alertness that it brings</p>
<p>and the hyperacuity that it brings.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>In fact, most people don&rsquo;t like the sensation</p>
<p>of a lot of adrenaline in their system.</p>
<p>It makes them feel very uncomfortable and out of control.</p>
<p>We will do an entire episode about adrenaline</p>
<p>and adrenaline junkies and adrenaline aversives</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>But the threat reflex inevitably involves the release</p>
<p>of adrenaline into the system.</p>
<p>And then it becomes a question of whether or not</p>
<p>you remain still, move forward or retreat</p>
<p>from that adrenaline experience.</p>
<p>And when I say the adrenaline experience,</p>
<p>I mean the threat reflex.</p>
<p>So this fourth component of fear is really our ability</p>
<p>to attach narrative, to attach meaning and to attach purpose</p>
<p>to what is by all accounts and purposes a generic response.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no negotiating what fear feels like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only negotiating what it means.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only negotiating whether or not you persist,</p>
<p>whether or not you pause or whether or not you retreat.</p>
<p>So this is usually the point in the podcast</p>
<p>where I think people start asking,</p>
<p>okay, well, there&rsquo;s the biology, there&rsquo;s the mechanism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the logic, how do I eliminate fear?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not quite that simple,</p>
<p>although by understanding the logic and the mechanisms</p>
<p>by which these circuits are built,</p>
<p>we can eventually get to that place.</p>
<p>I do want to plant a flag around a particular type of tool</p>
<p>or a logical framework around a particular set of tools</p>
<p>rather that we are going to build out through this episode.</p>
<p>And based on what you now know,</p>
<p>that the threat reflex gets input and it has outputs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s subject to these top-down processing events,</p>
<p>these narratives, you should be asking yourself,</p>
<p>what sort of narrative should I apply to eliminate fear?</p>
<p>Well, first let&rsquo;s take a step back</p>
<p>and just acknowledge the reality,</p>
<p>which is that fear is in some cases an adaptive response.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want people eliminating fears</p>
<p>that can get them injured or killed, right?</p>
<p>The reason that the fear threat response</p>
<p>and reflex exists at all is to help us from dying,</p>
<p>to help us from making really bad decisions.</p>
<p>It just so happens that a number of things happen to us</p>
<p>that are not lethal, that don&rsquo;t harm us,</p>
<p>but that harm us from the inside.</p>
<p>And I think that, and here I&rsquo;m borrowing language</p>
<p>from an excellent researcher</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done important work in this area at Harvard.</p>
<p>His name is Dr. Kerry Ressler.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s both a medical doctor and a PhD, so an MD-PhD.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the chief scientific officer at McLean Hospital.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s done extensive and important work on fear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to refer back to Dr. Ressler&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>several times during this podcast,</p>
<p>including important and super interesting work</p>
<p>on transgenerational passage of trauma.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a absolutely world-class biologist,</p>
<p>absolutely world-class clinician.</p>
<p>And Dr. Ressler has described fear before</p>
<p>as containing a historical component.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about a readiness for things</p>
<p>that might injure us or kill us in the immediate circumstance</p>
<p>but also protecting us for the future</p>
<p>because of our important need and ability to anticipate.</p>
<p>And what he describes are memories as protective</p>
<p>or memories as dangerous.</p>
<p>Some memories, even if they evoke a sense of fear in us,</p>
<p>are protective.</p>
<p>They protect us from making bad mistakes</p>
<p>that could get us injured or killed</p>
<p>or put us into really horrible circumstances.</p>
<p>Other memories are dangerous</p>
<p>because they create a sense in us of discomfort</p>
<p>and they tend to limit our behavior</p>
<p>in ways that are maladaptive,</p>
<p>that prevent us from having healthy relationships to others,</p>
<p>healthy job relationships,</p>
<p>healthy relationship to ourselves, frankly.</p>
<p>So this language of memories as protective</p>
<p>or memories as dangerous in the context of fear</p>
<p>is not something that I said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really something that I lifted from Dr. Ressler</p>
<p>in one of his many impressive lectures.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an important aspect of fear</p>
<p>because much of the fear system is a memory system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to embed a memory</p>
<p>of certain previous experiences in us</p>
<p>such that the threat reflex is activated</p>
<p>in anticipation of what might happen, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk for a second about how certain memories</p>
<p>get attached to this fear system.</p>
<p>And this brings us to a beautiful</p>
<p>and indeed Nobel prize winning aspect</p>
<p>of biology and physiology, which is Pavlovian conditioning.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar with Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs</p>
<p>and the famous Pavlovian conditioning experiments.</p>
<p>They go something like this.</p>
<p>You know, if you and Pavlov did these experiments</p>
<p>and ring a bell, a dog doesn&rsquo;t do much</p>
<p>in response to a bell.</p>
<p>It might attend to it,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t salivate typically in response to the bell.</p>
<p>However, if you pair the ringing of a bell</p>
<p>with a presentation of food enough times,</p>
<p>the dog will salivate in response to the food.</p>
<p>Eventually you take away the food,</p>
<p>you just ring the bell</p>
<p>and the dog will salivate in response to the bell, okay?</p>
<p>So in the context of so-called Pavlovian conditioning,</p>
<p>these things have names like condition stimulus</p>
<p>and unconditional stimulus and responses.</p>
<p>People often get these mixed up</p>
<p>and it can be a little confusing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to make it really simple for you.</p>
<p>The unconditioned stimulus is the thing</p>
<p>that evokes a response unconditionally.</p>
<p>So food is the unconditioned stimulus</p>
<p>in the example I just gave.</p>
<p>A foot shock or a loud bang would be</p>
<p>the unconditioned stimulus in, for instance,</p>
<p>an experiment geared toward exploring fear.</p>
<p>That unconditioned stimulus is unconditional.</p>
<p>It unconditionally evokes a startle</p>
<p>or in the case of food, salivating.</p>
<p>The bell in the previous example</p>
<p>is what we call the conditioned stimulus</p>
<p>or the conditioning stimulus.</p>
<p>Sometimes people mix these up.</p>
<p>The conditioned stimulus is paired with the thing</p>
<p>that naturally creates a response.</p>
<p>And then eventually the conditioned stimulus</p>
<p>creates the response itself.</p>
<p>You might think, well, that just seems, you know,</p>
<p>endlessly boring and simple,</p>
<p>but this is actually the way that our fear systems work.</p>
<p>Except unlike Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need many, many pairings of a bell</p>
<p>with some unconditioned stimulus in order to get a response.</p>
<p>You can get what&rsquo;s called one trial learning.</p>
<p>And in this circuit that involves the amygdala,</p>
<p>the threat reflex, and all this other, you know,</p>
<p>stuff that I was talking about earlier,</p>
<p>the system is set up for learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set up to create memories and to anticipate problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good system</p>
<p>because it was designed to keep us safe.</p>
<p>And so the way to think about this is that for many people,</p>
<p>one intense experience, one burn, one bad breakup,</p>
<p>one bad experience, public speaking,</p>
<p>one bad experience with somebody&rsquo;s pet snake</p>
<p>or whatever it happens to be</p>
<p>can cause intense fear in the moment,</p>
<p>a long reverberatory experience of fear,</p>
<p>like trouble sleeping that night and the following night,</p>
<p>memories of the experience that are troubling,</p>
<p>physiological responses that are troubling.</p>
<p>Essentially, it gets wired in as a fear with one trial,</p>
<p>which is quite different</p>
<p>than the other forms of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity, of course,</p>
<p>just being the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>Other forms of neuroplasticity like learning a language,</p>
<p>learning music, learning math, those take a while.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t generally get one trial learning</p>
<p>to positive or neutral experiences.</p>
<p>We get one trial learning to negative experiences.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this asymmetry in how we&rsquo;re wired.</p>
<p>So now you should understand how classical conditioning</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called occurs.</p>
<p>You go to give a piano recital as a kid,</p>
<p>you sit down and you freeze up and it&rsquo;s horribly embarrassing</p>
<p>and even if you just freeze up for a few seconds,</p>
<p>the heart rate increase and the perspiring,</p>
<p>the sweating, and the shame that you feel</p>
<p>leads you to want to avoid playing instruments</p>
<p>or public displays of performances</p>
<p>for a long period of time</p>
<p>unless you do something to overcome it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one trial learning.</p>
<p>Some people, it tends to be more</p>
<p>an accumulation of experiences.</p>
<p>They have a bad relationship that lasts an entire summer,</p>
<p>an entire year, or God forbid, a decade.</p>
<p>And then they have what they feel</p>
<p>of a general sense of fear</p>
<p>about closeness to others and attachment.</p>
<p>These are common fears that people experience.</p>
<p>Fears can be in the short-term,</p>
<p>fears can be in the long-term,</p>
<p>they can be in the medium-term.</p>
<p>Again, the fear system is very generic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wired to include memories that are very acute,</p>
<p>that happen within a moment,</p>
<p>or that include many, many events in long periods of time</p>
<p>that kind of funnel into a general sense of,</p>
<p>you know, relationships are bad</p>
<p>or this particular city or location is bad.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a key, what we call temporal component.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a component of the fear system</p>
<p>being able to batch many events in time</p>
<p>and create one specific fear,</p>
<p>or take one very specific isolated incident</p>
<p>that happened very briefly</p>
<p>and create one very large general sense of fears.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give an example of the latter</p>
<p>just to kind of flesh this out a little bit.</p>
<p>I had a friend come visit me in San Francisco</p>
<p>some years ago and their car got broken into,</p>
<p>unfortunately, a frequent occurrence in San Francisco</p>
<p>in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Never leave anything in your car in San Francisco.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll break in in the middle of the day, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Police can be having coffee right there</p>
<p>in front of them, they&rsquo;ll still do it.</p>
<p>For reasons we could discuss, this is a problem.</p>
<p>They got their belongings taken</p>
<p>and they decided they were never coming back</p>
<p>to San Francisco.</p>
<p>This was an isolated incident</p>
<p>that forever colored their view of the city,</p>
<p>which I, frankly, understanding the fear system,</p>
<p>I can understand.</p>
<p>We can have isolated incidents</p>
<p>that wick out to broad decisions about entire places,</p>
<p>or we can have many experiences</p>
<p>that funnel into very specific isolated fears</p>
<p>about particular circumstances, places, and things.</p>
<p>So I like to think that by now</p>
<p>you have a pretty good understanding</p>
<p>of the circuits that underlie the threat reflex,</p>
<p>the fear response, and how we have top-down control,</p>
<p>meaning we can attach a narrative to the fear response,</p>
<p>and that the fear response can be learned</p>
<p>in association with particular events, okay?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really talked about how the learning occurs.</p>
<p>And so I just want to take a moment and describe that</p>
<p>because it leads right into our discussion</p>
<p>about how to eliminate fears,</p>
<p>and indeed how to replace fears</p>
<p>with more positive experiences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a process in our nervous system</p>
<p>that we call neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity broadly defined</p>
<p>is the nervous system&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>But at a cellular level,</p>
<p>that occurs through a couple of different mechanisms.</p>
<p>One of the main mechanisms</p>
<p>is something called long-term potentiation.</p>
<p>Long-term potentiation involves the strengthening</p>
<p>of particular connections between neurons,</p>
<p>the connection sites between neurons we call synapses.</p>
<p>Actually, technically, synapses are the gaps</p>
<p>between those connections,</p>
<p>but nonetheless,</p>
<p>synapses are the point of communication between neurons,</p>
<p>and those can be strengthened</p>
<p>so that certain neurons can talk to other neurons</p>
<p>more robustly than they happened to before.</p>
<p>And anytime we talk about a particular event,</p>
<p>the car, the snake, the public speaking,</p>
<p>the trauma, the horrible experience,</p>
<p>wiring into the fear system,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about is a change in synaptic strengths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about neurons</p>
<p>that previously did not communicate well,</p>
<p>communicating very well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like going from a old school dial-up connection,</p>
<p>or even an old school telephone connection,</p>
<p>or Morse code connection of communication</p>
<p>to high-speed ethernet, to a 5G connection.</p>
<p>It gets faster, it gets more robust,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very, very clear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when you get long-term potentiation.</p>
<p>And long-term potentiation</p>
<p>involves a couple of cellular mechanisms</p>
<p>that are going to be relevant to our discussion</p>
<p>about treatments to undo fear.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just throw out a couple of the names</p>
<p>of some of those cellular elements right now.</p>
<p>The main one is the so-called NMDA receptor,</p>
<p>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.</p>
<p>And what this is, is this is a little docking site,</p>
<p>like a little parking slot on a neuron.</p>
<p>And when a neuron gets activated very strongly,</p>
<p>like from an intense event,</p>
<p>in the example of my friend, the intense event,</p>
<p>almost certainly activated NMDA receptors</p>
<p>related to their concept of protecting their property</p>
<p>in their cars, the break-in to their car</p>
<p>caused the NMDA receptor to be activated.</p>
<p>Normally, that NMDA receptor is not easily activated.</p>
<p>When it is activated, it sets off a cascade,</p>
<p>a series of signals within those neurons</p>
<p>that change those neurons.</p>
<p>It changes the genes they express.</p>
<p>It shuttles more parking spots</p>
<p>to the surface of those cells</p>
<p>so that the communication to those cells becomes easier.</p>
<p>It becomes faster.</p>
<p>And so the way to think about the NMDA receptor</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s used sometimes for normal things</p>
<p>that we do every day,</p>
<p>making cups of coffee and things like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s often used for learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used for creating new associations</p>
<p>in our nervous system.</p>
<p>And so the activation of the NMDA receptor and LTP,</p>
<p>and it involves some other things</p>
<p>that you may have heard of,</p>
<p>like brain-derived nootropic factors and calcium entry,</p>
<p>things that we can leave for a discussion for a future time.</p>
<p>But basically a whole cascade of events happen within cells</p>
<p>that then make just even the mere thought of something</p>
<p>or somebody or some event that happened</p>
<p>able to activate that threat reflex, okay?</p>
<p>So long-term potentiation is one of the main mechanisms</p>
<p>by which we take formerly innocuous or irrelevant events</p>
<p>and we make them scary.</p>
<p>We make them traumatic.</p>
<p>Our neurons have mechanisms to do this.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, the NMDA receptor</p>
<p>and long-term potentiation</p>
<p>can also run the whole system in reverse.</p>
<p>You can get what&rsquo;s called long-term depression,</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do</p>
<p>with the depression associated with low mood.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about is a weakening of connections.</p>
<p>You can go from having a very high-speed ethernet connection</p>
<p>between neurons, so to speak,</p>
<p>to a connection that&rsquo;s more like Morse code</p>
<p>or is like a poor dial-up connection, a really weak signal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening when you extinguish a fear,</p>
<p>when you unlearn a fear.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to talk about therapies</p>
<p>that are carried out in humans that allow fears to be undone,</p>
<p>that allow traumas to be reversed</p>
<p>such that people no longer feel bad</p>
<p>about a particular person, place, or thing,</p>
<p>either real interactions with that person, place, or thing,</p>
<p>or imagined interactions with that person, place, or thing.</p>
<p>That process, as I just mentioned,</p>
<p>also involves things like the NMDA receptor,</p>
<p>but rather than strengthening the connections,</p>
<p>the first thing that has to happen</p>
<p>is there needs to be a weakening of connections</p>
<p>that associate the person, place, or thing</p>
<p>with that threat reflex.</p>
<p>Subsequent to that, we will see</p>
<p>there needs to be a strengthening of some new experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s positive, okay?</p>
<p>This is a key element of where we are headed.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief,</p>
<p>it is not going to work to simply extinguish a fear.</p>
<p>One needs to extinguish a fear and or trauma</p>
<p>and replace that fearful or traumatic memory</p>
<p>or idea or response with a positive response.</p>
<p>And this is something that&rsquo;s rarely discussed</p>
<p>both in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>but certainly in the general discussion</p>
<p>around fear and trauma.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea that we can extinguish fears,</p>
<p>we can rewire ourselves,</p>
<p>we can eliminate our traumas, and indeed we can,</p>
<p>but that process has to involve</p>
<p>not just becoming comfortable</p>
<p>with a particular fearful event or trauma,</p>
<p>but also attaching a new positive experience</p>
<p>to that previously fearful or traumatic event.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different approaches out there</p>
<p>that are in clinical use</p>
<p>to try and alleviate fear and trauma,</p>
<p>and indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>It might be surprising to learn</p>
<p>that many of those treatments, such as SSRIs,</p>
<p>the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>things like Prozac and Zoloft and similar,</p>
<p>and other antidepressants,</p>
<p>or things like benzodiazepines,</p>
<p>which are essentially like painkillers.</p>
<p>They create elevation in certain transmitters in the brain</p>
<p>like GABA, among others.</p>
<p>They can have a pain-relieving effect.</p>
<p>They are generally, however, considered anxiolytics.</p>
<p>They reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>And even antipsychotic drugs or beta blockers,</p>
<p>sometimes called adrenergic blockers,</p>
<p>drugs that are designed to prevent the heart</p>
<p>from beating too fast or to reduce blood pressure,</p>
<p>to reduce some elements</p>
<p>of that hypothalamic pituitary axis response</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Many people experience some degree of relief</p>
<p>from the symptoms of anxiety and fear and PTSD.</p>
<p>In taking these various compounds.</p>
<p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re prescribed so broadly.</p>
<p>But you may find it interesting to note</p>
<p>that none of those current treatments</p>
<p>are based on the neurobiology of fear,</p>
<p>at least not directly, right?</p>
<p>People that take SSRIs oftentimes</p>
<p>will experience a reduction in anxiety.</p>
<p>It depends on the dosage and the individual, of course,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And you have to work with a doctor, a psychiatrist</p>
<p>to determine whether or not they&rsquo;re right for you</p>
<p>and the correct dosage, if they are right for you.</p>
<p>But that modulation of anxiety can indirectly</p>
<p>reduce the likelihood that one will have a panic attack</p>
<p>or experience of fear or an intense experience of fear</p>
<p>or reliving of a trauma.</p>
<p>But the SSRIs themselves are not plugging</p>
<p>into some specific mechanism related</p>
<p>to how fear comes about in the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an indirect support.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important because if the goal of modern psychiatry</p>
<p>and the goal of modern biology is to provide</p>
<p>mechanistic understanding that leads to treatments,</p>
<p>we need to think about what are the sorts of treatments</p>
<p>that tap into the very fear circuits</p>
<p>that we described before.</p>
<p>The fact that there are memories attached</p>
<p>to a generic threat reflex and response,</p>
<p>and the threat reflex response can be linked up</p>
<p>with the dopamine system and can be linked up</p>
<p>with other systems that are involved in pain relief</p>
<p>and anxiety and so forth.</p>
<p>And so that brings us to which treatments</p>
<p>are directly related to the fear circuitry</p>
<p>and the circuitry related to trauma.</p>
<p>And the primary one to begin with</p>
<p>is the so-called behavioral therapies.</p>
<p>Now, oftentimes we all wish, I think, from time to time,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some specific pill that we can take,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s some machine or device</p>
<p>that we can plug our finger into,</p>
<p>or that we can put on a headset and all of a sudden</p>
<p>we just rewire our nervous system,</p>
<p>fear is gone, trauma is gone, but it doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>And when we think of language and narrative</p>
<p>as a tool to rewire our nervous system,</p>
<p>in comparison to those kinds of ideas</p>
<p>about pills and machines and potions,</p>
<p>it starts to seem a little bit weak, right?</p>
<p>If we just think, oh, well, how could talking</p>
<p>actually change the way that we respond to something?</p>
<p>But actually there are three forms of therapy</p>
<p>that purely through the use of language</p>
<p>have been shown to have very strong positive impact,</p>
<p>meaning reduce fears and traumas.</p>
<p>And those three are prolonged exposure therapy,</p>
<p>cognitive processing, or CPT,</p>
<p>and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to go into the entire literature</p>
<p>around prolonged exposure, cognitive processing,</p>
<p>and cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>but I will just illustrate the central theme</p>
<p>that allows them to work.</p>
<p>Now, remember that the circuit for fear,</p>
<p>the circuit for trauma involves this generic reflex,</p>
<p>and then there are those top-down elements</p>
<p>coming from the forebrain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear, because it&rsquo;s been measured,</p>
<p>that if you look at the amount of anxiety,</p>
<p>the pure physiological anxiety response</p>
<p>of quickening of heart rate, flushing of the skin,</p>
<p>sometimes quaking of the hands, the experience of fear,</p>
<p>over time, when people recount or retell their trauma,</p>
<p>that the first time they do that,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s recounted in a lot of detail,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tremendous anxiety response,</p>
<p>sometimes even as great or greater</p>
<p>than the actual exposure to the fearful event or trauma.</p>
<p>And obviously, this is something that is done</p>
<p>with a clinician present,</p>
<p>because it is very traumatic to the person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally reliving the trauma in full, rich detail,</p>
<p>and they are encouraged to provide full, rich detail.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often encouraged to speak in complete sentences,</p>
<p>to flesh out details about how they felt inside,</p>
<p>to flesh out details about their memories</p>
<p>going into this traumatic or fearful event,</p>
<p>going through it, and after, really digging in</p>
<p>to all the nuance and contours of these horrible experiences.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s remarkable is that in the second and the third</p>
<p>and the fourth retelling of these traumatic</p>
<p>or fearful events, that anxiety response</p>
<p>and the amount of the physiological response,</p>
<p>I should say that the amplitude</p>
<p>of the physiological response,</p>
<p>becomes progressively diminished with each retelling.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be saying,</p>
<p>well, duh, you tell a story enough times</p>
<p>that eventually it wears off,</p>
<p>just like if you watch a movie enough times</p>
<p>and you hear the same joke enough times,</p>
<p>eventually it doesn&rsquo;t have the same impact,</p>
<p>but that needn&rsquo;t be the case, right?</p>
<p>You could imagine that this high amplitude anxiety response,</p>
<p>this high amplitude activation</p>
<p>of the sympathetic nervous system in retelling</p>
<p>would actually create a even deeper routed fear response</p>
<p>and trauma, but that&rsquo;s not what happens.</p>
<p>And every clinician I spoke to</p>
<p>in anticipation of this episode,</p>
<p>which include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists,</p>
<p>and people who actually work on the fear system</p>
<p>at a biological level said the exact same thing,</p>
<p>which is that a detailed recounting</p>
<p>of the traumatic and fearful events is absolutely essential</p>
<p>in order to get the positive effects</p>
<p>of prolonged exposure, cognitive processing</p>
<p>and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>Again, this has to be done with the appropriate support.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something that should be taken lightly</p>
<p>because as we&rsquo;ve mentioned before,</p>
<p>the fear response can have a very long lasting</p>
<p>contour to it.</p>
<p>People can sometimes have trouble sleeping</p>
<p>for days and days.</p>
<p>And afterwards we&rsquo;ll talk about sleeping a little bit,</p>
<p>but the point is that the retelling is important.</p>
<p>And the idea here is to take what was a terrible</p>
<p>and extremely troubling, meaning physiologically troubling,</p>
<p>psychologically troubling story,</p>
<p>and turn it into what is essentially a boring bad story.</p>
<p>Okay, it never really becomes a good story</p>
<p>at this point in the treatment process</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>So a terrible event is a terrible event, period.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a way in which the retelling of that event</p>
<p>starts to uncouple the threat reflex from the narrative.</p>
<p>And with each successive retelling in detail</p>
<p>of these traumatic events, of these fearful events,</p>
<p>the threat reflex is activated</p>
<p>at a progressively lower and lower amplitude</p>
<p>such that eventually it just becomes a really bad,</p>
<p>really boring story.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s one part of the process of getting over a fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we call fear extinction.</p>
<p>And we can bring ourselves back to our earlier example</p>
<p>of Pavlovian conditioning,</p>
<p>because many studies have been done</p>
<p>both in animals and in humans showing that, for instance,</p>
<p>if you pair a tone, you know, a bell or a buzzer</p>
<p>with a foot shock that an animal or a person</p>
<p>will brace themselves for the foot shock.</p>
<p>Eventually you can just give the bell or tone</p>
<p>and the person will experience that same freezing up</p>
<p>or the same fight or flight or freeze response.</p>
<p>So they do condition that.</p>
<p>But if you give the tone or the bell over and over</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no foot shock, there&rsquo;s no pain.</p>
<p>And in humans, this is sometimes done with foot shock.</p>
<p>Sometimes, believe it or not, with mild burn.</p>
<p>There are even some studies, there&rsquo;s older studies,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t do those now, nor would you want to.</p>
<p>But eventually what happens is the tone,</p>
<p>the bell no longer evokes that response, okay?</p>
<p>So you see this as a reversal of the classical conditioning</p>
<p>and we call that reversal extinction.</p>
<p>So the retelling of this traumatic or fearful narrative,</p>
<p>excuse me, fearful narrative,</p>
<p>is essentially an extinction process.</p>
<p>Now, how is this done?</p>
<p>One can do this in a therapist&rsquo;s office face-to-face,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sometimes done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes done in group type settings</p>
<p>where people actually stand up</p>
<p>or sit in front of a group, small or large,</p>
<p>and recount in detail their traumatic experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes done by people</p>
<p>writing out the experience in detail.</p>
<p>And which one of these is most effective</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really clear.</p>
<p>The literature points to the fact that</p>
<p>a feeling of trust, obviously,</p>
<p>between the patient and the clinician</p>
<p>or the person and the group is essential.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t have access to</p>
<p>because of finances or other limitations</p>
<p>to therapy of that sort.</p>
<p>In that case, journaling in detail</p>
<p>has been shown to be effective.</p>
<p>Although again, I want to caution people</p>
<p>about reactivating traumas without consideration</p>
<p>for the kinds of social support they might need</p>
<p>around that reactivation.</p>
<p>And we will talk a little bit later</p>
<p>about some of the chemicals involved in social support</p>
<p>and why those help extinguish fears.</p>
<p>So the thing to embed in your mind</p>
<p>is that recognition of the early traumatic</p>
<p>or fearful event in detail over and over</p>
<p>is key to forming a new non-traumatic association</p>
<p>with that event or person.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part one.</p>
<p>You need to diminish the old experience.</p>
<p>And when I say diminish,</p>
<p>I mean reduce the amplitude of the physiological response.</p>
<p>Now, this is just but one approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about other approaches</p>
<p>to eliminating fear and trauma as we go forward.</p>
<p>But I want to emphasize that diminishing the amplitude</p>
<p>of the physiological response is the first step.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a clearing away of the association</p>
<p>between the person, place or thing and that threat reflex.</p>
<p>But even after that&rsquo;s occurred,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an essential need to relearn a new narrative.</p>
<p>Why is there essential need to relearn a new narrative</p>
<p>or create a new association?</p>
<p>Well, that has to do with that fear reflex circuitry.</p>
<p>As you recall, there are outputs to areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with dopamine release and reinforcement.</p>
<p>And that we now know offers the capacity</p>
<p>for these fear circuits and these circuits</p>
<p>that underlie trauma to be mapped onto new experiences</p>
<p>that are of positive association.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give a kind of basic example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of a silly example,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m giving it as a template</p>
<p>for what could be any number of other different examples.</p>
<p>Example I&rsquo;ll give is let&rsquo;s say a kid is biking</p>
<p>to play soccer, soccer practice,</p>
<p>and they get into a bad car accident, okay?</p>
<p>Terrible thing to happen, but they survive, they recover.</p>
<p>And somehow, and we really don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>certain fear memories get wired in more broadly</p>
<p>or more narrowly.</p>
<p>Somehow this kid just doesn&rsquo;t even want to bicycle anymore.</p>
<p>And they actually don&rsquo;t even want to play sports.</p>
<p>And they actually just don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of isolating</p>
<p>and not interacting with friends very much at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty broad response.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>Some kids would just decide they don&rsquo;t want to cycle anymore</p>
<p>down that particular street.</p>
<p>Well, the process of retelling the narrative to a clinician</p>
<p>would allow an extinction of the fear response, right?</p>
<p>So a reduction in the heart rate,</p>
<p>a reduction in the narrowing of focus,</p>
<p>a reduction in all the things that we consider fear.</p>
<p>But a really good cognitive behavioral therapist</p>
<p>or somebody that understands the neuroscience</p>
<p>of fear and trauma would understand</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not sufficient.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really important is that this child,</p>
<p>this hypothetical child, relearn a new narrative</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t just manage to bike to soccer practice</p>
<p>or manage to spend time with friends,</p>
<p>but that they actually start wiring in</p>
<p>new positive associations with biking to practice,</p>
<p>with playing soccer, with social events.</p>
<p>And, and this is the somewhat surprising feature of this,</p>
<p>and that they link that back</p>
<p>to that early traumatic experience.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re replacing</p>
<p>a bad experience and memory with a good experience</p>
<p>and memory, but they&rsquo;re actually holding in mind</p>
<p>in these top-down narrative circuits, if you will,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re holding in mind,</p>
<p>ah, I&rsquo;m not just biking to soccer practice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually biking to soccer practice</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m enjoying it despite the fact</p>
<p>that I was in a bad car accident,</p>
<p>despite the fact that two months ago or two years ago,</p>
<p>or maybe even 10 years ago,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even leave my room</p>
<p>or I didn&rsquo;t want to associate with anybody.</p>
<p>So the building up of the positive associations are key.</p>
<p>And the linking of those positive associations</p>
<p>with the earlier traumatic event is key</p>
<p>for the following reason.</p>
<p>The top-down circuitry from the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>to this threat reflex circuit</p>
<p>is not like the other connections in that circuit.</p>
<p>The other connections in that circuit</p>
<p>are what we call glutamatergic and excitatory.</p>
<p>They are all about activating other neurons,</p>
<p>like a chain reaction.</p>
<p>One neuron activates, the next activates,</p>
<p>the next like dominoes falling.</p>
<p>These top-down circuits that feed into the threat reflex</p>
<p>and all its parts is what we call inhibitory.</p>
<p>It tends to prevent activation of those given circuitries.</p>
<p>It tends to prevent activation of the threat reflex.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s acting as a break.</p>
<p>And so when we think of positive experiences</p>
<p>being associated with what was previously</p>
<p>a negative experience,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking about forgetting</p>
<p>that the car accident was horrible</p>
<p>or forgetting that the assault was absolutely dreadful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about attaching a new positive memory</p>
<p>to the circuitry so that the previous fear response</p>
<p>is far less likely to occur</p>
<p>and that it remains extinguished.</p>
<p>So just to make sure this is absolutely clear,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a first step which involves retelling and reliving</p>
<p>in order to extinguish the fear and the trauma,</p>
<p>to reduce the amplitude of the response.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a need to replace</p>
<p>or attach positive experiences</p>
<p>to the earlier what would be traumatic response.</p>
<p>The extinction has to go first.</p>
<p>This is key.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, the car accident was actually a good thing</p>
<p>because I stayed home a lot that year and I got to study.</p>
<p>You can tell yourself that, and that could also be true,</p>
<p>but that won&rsquo;t necessarily and probably won&rsquo;t eliminate</p>
<p>the fear or the traumatic association of the car accident.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m using car accidents</p>
<p>as a general example or a generic example here.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a three-part process.</p>
<p>One, diminish the old experience</p>
<p>through repetitive narrative.</p>
<p>Almost inevitably, the initial repetition of that</p>
<p>is going to be very high amplitude and quite troubling,</p>
<p>but over time it will reduce, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re turning the terrible, really upsetting story</p>
<p>into a terrible, boring story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the extinction process.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a relearning of a new narrative</p>
<p>that includes some sort of sense of reward,</p>
<p>and that sense of reward has to be tacked back</p>
<p>onto the traumatic event</p>
<p>or what was previously a traumatic event.</p>
<p>And that is all through narrative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all through cognition.</p>
<p>And I think this is a very important point.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, I think we tend to undervalue</p>
<p>the importance of rationalization</p>
<p>and of story and of narrative.</p>
<p>But the prefrontal cortex is this amazing capacity</p>
<p>of our brain real estate to create meaning,</p>
<p>to attach meaning and purpose</p>
<p>to things that otherwise are just reflexive.</p>
<p>And in the example of an ice bath,</p>
<p>it might be a little trivial.</p>
<p>In the example of the kid with the car accident,</p>
<p>it becomes a little more relevant.</p>
<p>And in the example of things like people surviving</p>
<p>genocide or attaching stories of great victory</p>
<p>to what were previously thought of as stories of great loss,</p>
<p>of time, of people, of any number of things,</p>
<p>that process of narrative is one of the major ways</p>
<p>that the human brain rewires itself.</p>
<p>Narrative should not be undervalued</p>
<p>as a tool for relieving fear and trauma.</p>
<p>In fact, narrative is one of the best and most potent ways</p>
<p>that we can rewire our fear circuitry,</p>
<p>and that indeed we can form completely new relationships</p>
<p>to things over time.</p>
<p>So basically, narrative should not be undervalued</p>
<p>as a tool to rewire our nervous system,</p>
<p>but it has to be engaged in the correct sequence.</p>
<p>And that correct sequence is first extinction,</p>
<p>then relearning a new narrative with positive associations</p>
<p>and attaching those positive associations</p>
<p>to the formerly traumatic or fearful event.</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned prolonged exposure therapy,</p>
<p>cognitive processing, and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>For those of you that are seeking relief</p>
<p>from fear and traumatic events,</p>
<p>you can look up licensed clinicians that can carry out</p>
<p>those one or several of those types of therapies.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about other forms of therapy.</p>
<p>One of the ones that comes up a lot is so-called EMDR,</p>
<p>eye movement desensitization reprocessing,</p>
<p>developed by Francine Shapiro in the 80s.</p>
<p>Eye movement desensitization reprocessing</p>
<p>involves moving the eyes side to side</p>
<p>while recounting a traumatic or fearful narrative,</p>
<p>typically with a clinician present.</p>
<p>Why would that work?</p>
<p>Well, basically, when I first heard about EMDR</p>
<p>from my stance as a vision scientist,</p>
<p>I thought the whole thing was kind of crazy</p>
<p>and half-baked, frankly.</p>
<p>I heard these theories that, oh,</p>
<p>it recreates the eye movements in rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>or REM sleep, and that&rsquo;s completely false.</p>
<p>It does not.</p>
<p>I heard the argument EMDR activates both sides of the brain,</p>
<p>which I guess hypothetically</p>
<p>was thought to be important somehow.</p>
<p>And frankly, there&rsquo;s no evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that EMDR activates both sides of the brain</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s beneficial.</p>
<p>I mean, by looking from side to side,</p>
<p>just because of the way that binocular visual circuits</p>
<p>are organized, it will do that.</p>
<p>But it never made any sense to me why EMDR would work</p>
<p>until several years ago when I saw,</p>
<p>because I reviewed no fewer than five papers,</p>
<p>some in animal models, others in humans,</p>
<p>looking at lateral eye movements,</p>
<p>meaning eye movements from side to side with eyes open,</p>
<p>not eyes up or down.</p>
<p>And what was observed in these experiments,</p>
<p>in all of them actually, all five of those papers,</p>
<p>was a dramatic reduction in the activation</p>
<p>and actually an inhibition, a suppression of the fear</p>
<p>or threat reflex circuitry, which was a jaw dropper for me.</p>
<p>I thought, wow, actually it was a jaw dropper eye widener</p>
<p>for me, I thought, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>maybe this EMDR stuff works according to some mechanism</p>
<p>and maybe this is the mechanism.</p>
<p>And indeed many laboratories, not mine,</p>
<p>but many laboratories are now pursuing that idea</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s looking very likely.</p>
<p>Why would that happen?</p>
<p>Well, just very briefly, lateralized eye movements</p>
<p>of the sort that I&rsquo;m describing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m moving my hand like this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just do it with my eyes,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s a little embarrassing to do that</p>
<p>because I know it looks strange, I don&rsquo;t mind,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m doing EMDR and EMDR reduces activation</p>
<p>of the amygdala and related circuitries,</p>
<p>which reduces anxiety and reduces the amplitude</p>
<p>of the threat reflex,</p>
<p>reduces sympathetic autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>In other words, we feel calmer or we feel less alert,</p>
<p>less stressed when moving our eyes from side to side.</p>
<p>And the just so story about this is that</p>
<p>these are the sorts of eye movements that we do</p>
<p>when we are ambulating, moving through space,</p>
<p>through some sort of self-generated motion.</p>
<p>And one can make up a pretty reasonable story</p>
<p>in the evolutionary context or ethological context</p>
<p>that forward movement and fear</p>
<p>are generally incompatible with one another,</p>
<p>that generally a fear response</p>
<p>involves a freezing or retreating.</p>
<p>Some people will advance,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s usually a trained advance in response to fear,</p>
<p>so first responders and so forth.</p>
<p>Most people freeze or retreat when they&rsquo;re afraid.</p>
<p>Forward movement generates these eye movements.</p>
<p>It does seem to suppress activation of this threat reflex</p>
<p>and the amygdala in particular.</p>
<p>So for the many EMDR practitioners out there,</p>
<p>these papers I think are a great celebration.</p>
<p>And I think there is now increasing excitement about EMDR</p>
<p>in the psychiatric and psychological community</p>
<p>for its utility for treating fear, trauma, and PTSD.</p>
<p>However, I should point out that in discussing EMDR</p>
<p>with various colleagues of mine at Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>I was told that EMDR has been shown</p>
<p>to be beneficial in particular</p>
<p>for single event type traumas or fearful experiences,</p>
<p>not so much for relieving the trauma</p>
<p>or feelings of fear associated, for instance,</p>
<p>with an entire bad marriage or an entire childhood,</p>
<p>but more for single, more acute events</p>
<p>that can be described within a very kind of brief narrative,</p>
<p>brief, not necessarily in time,</p>
<p>but that the car accident,</p>
<p>the bad interaction with another individual,</p>
<p>the assault, God forbid, these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And I realized we&rsquo;re down in the weeds of topics</p>
<p>that are unpleasant.</p>
<p>And so I have great sensitivity to that,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s also important that we be realistic</p>
<p>about the kinds of things that traumatize people.</p>
<p>So is EMDR useful?</p>
<p>Well, it seems like it works for these single event</p>
<p>or kind of constrained event type traumas</p>
<p>that people can describe while moving their eyes</p>
<p>from side to side,</p>
<p>generally in the presence of a clinician.</p>
<p>However, if we think back to the model</p>
<p>of how you extinguish and then replace a trauma or fear,</p>
<p>remember, you have to diminish the old experience,</p>
<p>the amplitude of that, you need to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the extinguish portion.</p>
<p>Then you need to relearn a new narrative</p>
<p>and attach reward to the old traumatic event.</p>
<p>EMDR only really taps into the extinction</p>
<p>of the physiological response to the old experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are EMDR practitioners out there</p>
<p>that are thinking about the attaching</p>
<p>of the new narrative and reward,</p>
<p>but there I&rsquo;ve heard less</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen fewer peer reviewed papers on that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about this logically.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, and indeed it&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>that sitting down in a chair,</p>
<p>moving eyes side to side deliberately</p>
<p>for some period of time reduces activation</p>
<p>of the threat reflex.</p>
<p>I, or the patient in this case,</p>
<p>recites or repeats over and over the traumatic event</p>
<p>or the fearful event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing that in the presence</p>
<p>of a lower amplitude response.</p>
<p>Remember back to where we talked</p>
<p>about how the retelling works best.</p>
<p>If the first time it&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge amplitude response.</p>
<p>And then with each successive repeat,</p>
<p>that response, the threat response gets lower and lower.</p>
<p>With EMDR, you&rsquo;re sort of short circuiting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of sneaking around the corner</p>
<p>of that high amplitude response.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s taking a somewhat different approach</p>
<p>of trying to extinguish the bad feelings in body and mind</p>
<p>associated with an experience</p>
<p>by reducing the physiological response.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s somewhat different.</p>
<p>And at least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>and EMDR practitioners, please correct me,</p>
<p>but at least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t an active component to EMDR</p>
<p>of relearning a new narrative and attaching reward.</p>
<p>Now, reward and attaching reward</p>
<p>requires a somewhat high amplitude sympathetic arousal.</p>
<p>It requires a feeling of a victory, which is arousal, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s positive arousal, not negative arousal,</p>
<p>but it is arousal.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not focusing on this</p>
<p>to try and diminish the potential impact of EMDR.</p>
<p>I know many people have achieved great relief from EMDR,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tap into all the aspects</p>
<p>of the extinction and relearning</p>
<p>that we talked about previously.</p>
<p>And therefore I think on its own,</p>
<p>at least in many cases,</p>
<p>is unlikely to be a complete therapy for fear and trauma.</p>
<p>If there are people out there</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve had terrific results with EMDR,</p>
<p>please let us know in the comment section.</p>
<p>On YouTube would be the ideal place.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had bad experiences with EMDR</p>
<p>or it didn&rsquo;t work for you, also let us know.</p>
<p>I think that EMDR practitioners,</p>
<p>like most practitioners in the psychiatric</p>
<p>and psychological space,</p>
<p>are eager to expand their practices</p>
<p>in order to make them more effective,</p>
<p>rather than clinging ardently to something</p>
<p>that perhaps is incomplete</p>
<p>or that doesn&rsquo;t work for certain individuals.</p>
<p>So I think they would appreciate that feedback, as would I.</p>
<p>So, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>most of these therapies are done in conjunction</p>
<p>with a skilled, often one would hope, credentialed clinician.</p>
<p>There are many people, however,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have access to that</p>
<p>or who are working through stuff.</p>
<p>They have things in their past</p>
<p>that are very uncomfortable to them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m aware that many people are working</p>
<p>through those things, through journaling,</p>
<p>through talking to a friend,</p>
<p>through any number of different</p>
<p>sort of non-traditional approaches.</p>
<p>One thing that really pertains to everybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s working through fear and trauma of any kind</p>
<p>is the importance of social connection</p>
<p>as it relates to the chemical systems</p>
<p>and the neural circuits associated with fear and trauma.</p>
<p>And this is a emerging literature in neuroscience</p>
<p>that is really a beautiful one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very conserved biology.</p>
<p>We see it, believe it or not, in flies, in fruit flies,</p>
<p>a commonly used model system, in mice,</p>
<p>and indeed in humans as well.</p>
<p>And this is the work of David Anderson&rsquo;s group at Caltech,</p>
<p>of, again, of Dr. Ressler&rsquo;s group at Harvard Medical,</p>
<p>and elsewhere, of course.</p>
<p>And this is the work as it relates to tachykinin.</p>
<p>Tachykinin is a very interesting molecule in our brain.</p>
<p>And it turns out that tachykinin is activated in neurons</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called the central amygdala</p>
<p>and some nearby structures.</p>
<p>So really smack dab within the middle of this threat reflex</p>
<p>very soon after some traumatic</p>
<p>or fear-inducing event occurs.</p>
<p>And it actually sets in motion a number of other things,</p>
<p>including changes in gene expression and potentiation,</p>
<p>meaning long-term potentiation,</p>
<p>activation of NMDA receptors, and so on,</p>
<p>in the circuits that reinforce</p>
<p>that fearful or traumatic experience.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about tachykinin</p>
<p>is also that it&rsquo;s been shown to lead</p>
<p>to low to moderate levels of anxiety</p>
<p>and even kind of aggression, irritability.</p>
<p>Tachykinin levels are further increased</p>
<p>by social isolation.</p>
<p>And that social isolation is oftentimes</p>
<p>what can exacerbate preexisting traumas or fearful events.</p>
<p>And in a kind of beautiful symmetry</p>
<p>to that kind of dark and depressing story,</p>
<p>social connection with people that we trust,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be direct physical contact,</p>
<p>but just social connection,</p>
<p>conversing with, sharing a meal with,</p>
<p>it could be physical touch if that&rsquo;s appropriate,</p>
<p>those sorts of connections actually serve</p>
<p>to reduce the effectiveness</p>
<p>or even the levels of tachykinin.</p>
<p>So the important point here is that trauma</p>
<p>is traumatic in and of itself.</p>
<p>Fearful events are hard in and of themselves.</p>
<p>And if people are working through them,</p>
<p>either through clinical work or through individual work,</p>
<p>it is important.</p>
<p>And ideally, one would still be trying</p>
<p>to access social connection outside</p>
<p>of that specific work related to the trauma.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be outside of that.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have a good relationship</p>
<p>with a clinician or therapist</p>
<p>to the point where there&rsquo;s real trust</p>
<p>and you feel a social connection with them, wonderful.</p>
<p>But for many people,</p>
<p>they have a more transactional relationship</p>
<p>to the EMDR practitioner or to their therapist,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re working through things on their own.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>that regular social connection,</p>
<p>trusting social connection of any kind</p>
<p>is going to be very beneficial for that process.</p>
<p>And so this is not kind of just hand wavy, new agey stuff</p>
<p>like, oh, you need social connection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a actual neurochemical basis for social isolation</p>
<p>that has an amplifying effect on fear and trauma.</p>
<p>And there is a neurochemical basis for the relief</p>
<p>from fear and trauma and isolation.</p>
<p>And in the ideal circumstance,</p>
<p>one is working through these traumas and fears</p>
<p>very intensely in a very dedicated way,</p>
<p>but then is also engaging</p>
<p>in the sorts of social interactions</p>
<p>that are going to diminish the amount of tachykinin</p>
<p>and going to suppress those very circuits</p>
<p>that would otherwise be amplified.</p>
<p>So next I&rsquo;d like to talk about some really interesting</p>
<p>and almost kind of eerie scientific findings,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the transgenerational passage of trauma</p>
<p>or predisposition to fear and trauma.</p>
<p>This is a scientific literature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been debated many times</p>
<p>over the last really 50 plus years,</p>
<p>but in more recent studies have really proven</p>
<p>that we as humans have the capacity</p>
<p>to inherit a predisposition to trauma or fear.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that we will become traumatized or experience extreme fear</p>
<p>just because our parents or grandparents experienced that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a predisposition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bias.</p>
<p>Let me explain the papers that focus on this</p>
<p>for a little bit,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll talk about what this means for each of us.</p>
<p>One of the most important papers in this area</p>
<p>comes to us from someone I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>Dr. Kerry Ressler at Harvard.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is</p>
<p>Association of FKB5 Polymorphisms and Childhood Abuse</p>
<p>with Risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</p>
<p>Symptoms in Adults.</p>
<p>And there are other papers as well.</p>
<p>Another one from the Ressler Lab,</p>
<p>first author, Brian Diaz, D-I-A-S.</p>
<p>Parental Olfactory Experience Influences Behavior</p>
<p>and Neural Structure in Subsequent Generations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to summarize these papers</p>
<p>and their general contour and papers related to them,</p>
<p>although feel free to look up the papers I just described.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to them in the caption</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to go further.</p>
<p>But basically these explorations involve</p>
<p>looking at the histories of human individuals</p>
<p>who had trauma or abuse of some kind in their childhood,</p>
<p>and then looking at the likelihood of fear</p>
<p>and PTSD type symptomology in their offspring.</p>
<p>And essentially what they identified is that indeed,</p>
<p>if you had a parent,</p>
<p>and there does seem to be a kind of a bias</p>
<p>toward an effect where if the father had abuse,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s severe abuse or moderate abuse,</p>
<p>that abuse causes a change in his genetics,</p>
<p>in his sperm, that can be passed on to offspring</p>
<p>such that the offspring have a lower threshold</p>
<p>to develop trauma or extreme fear</p>
<p>to certain types of events.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s important to point out</p>
<p>is that predisposition or bias</p>
<p>is not necessarily to the same sorts of events.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the abuse itself gets passed</p>
<p>from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a predisposition.</p>
<p>And the title of that paper mentioned FKB5,</p>
<p>excuse me, FKBP5 polymorphisms.</p>
<p>And the FKBP5 polymorphism maps</p>
<p>to a location in the genome that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with the so-called glucocorticoid system</p>
<p>with cortisol release.</p>
<p>So the predisposition that one might inherit</p>
<p>from having a parent, father or mother,</p>
<p>but stronger tendency to inherit it from the father</p>
<p>who experienced abuse is one in which</p>
<p>the glucocorticoid system, the cortisol system,</p>
<p>and that HPA axis that we talked about before,</p>
<p>the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis</p>
<p>is sensitized or reactive in a way</p>
<p>that sets a lower threshold to become traumatized</p>
<p>or very afraid of certain types of events.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not unique to the specific type of abuse</p>
<p>that the parent experienced.</p>
<p>Now, this is really, really important</p>
<p>because a lot of times out there,</p>
<p>I will hear that there&rsquo;s passage</p>
<p>or transgenerational passage of actual trauma,</p>
<p>the specific trauma.</p>
<p>Now that could be through narrative telling.</p>
<p>You know, if somebody is exposed to a lot of narrative</p>
<p>about their parents&rsquo; trauma in one form or another,</p>
<p>it may be that they start to internalize</p>
<p>some of that trauma.</p>
<p>And there could be,</p>
<p>because we obviously can&rsquo;t rule it out,</p>
<p>there could be some other signatures</p>
<p>of prior specific traumas they get passed on to offspring.</p>
<p>But more likely, and certainly what these data</p>
<p>about these polymorphisms point to,</p>
<p>is that what gets passed on is a propensity</p>
<p>for the threat reflex to get activated</p>
<p>and attached to a wider variety</p>
<p>or to less intense types of inputs and experiences.</p>
<p>And the important point to take away from this</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not some magical, mysterious,</p>
<p>and mystical thing that&rsquo;s being transplanted</p>
<p>from parent to child.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gene or it&rsquo;s a modification in a set of genes</p>
<p>that gives a heightened level of responsivity</p>
<p>to fearful type events</p>
<p>or even a heightened level of responsivity</p>
<p>such that things that wouldn&rsquo;t be fear-inducing</p>
<p>or trauma-inducing to certain individuals</p>
<p>can trigger fear and trauma in these children</p>
<p>that inherit this particular gene.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they are fated</p>
<p>to forever be traumatized or live in fear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a genetic predisposition.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you had a parent</p>
<p>or parents that were traumatized or not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no evidence, at least as far as I&rsquo;m aware,</p>
<p>that the treatments for trauma should be any different.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there aren&rsquo;t gene therapies</p>
<p>currently aimed at these particular variants</p>
<p>like FKBP5 and so forth</p>
<p>that could reverse those particular genetic underpinnings</p>
<p>of the trauma predisposition.</p>
<p>So this transgenerational passage of trauma,</p>
<p>I think is extremely interesting in large part</p>
<p>because it brings us back to this idea</p>
<p>that the threat reflex is part of a larger sensory system.</p>
<p>Normally we think of seeing as a sensory system</p>
<p>or hearing as a sensory system,</p>
<p>but the threat detection and threat learning system,</p>
<p>the fear learning system, is in many ways a sensory system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a sensory system</p>
<p>that is very generic in its response.</p>
<p>That generic response, again, is good</p>
<p>because it allows for flexibility,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s bad because it reduces specificity.</p>
<p>We can essentially become fearful or traumatized by anything</p>
<p>if the circuit gets activated,</p>
<p>and these particular children inherit a predisposition</p>
<p>for more things and less intense things to traumatize them.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, we are going to discuss</p>
<p>some of the behavioral treatments,</p>
<p>including some really new exciting protocols</p>
<p>for dealing with fear and trauma.</p>
<p>But for a few minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to discuss some of the drug treatments</p>
<p>that are starting to emerge as potential therapeutics,</p>
<p>in particular for PTSD.</p>
<p>The two drug treatments I&rsquo;d like to focus on</p>
<p>are ketamine-assisted psychotherapy</p>
<p>and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Currently, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is legal.</p>
<p>It is approved, provided it is prescribed</p>
<p>by a board-certified physician in the United States.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not certain about other areas of the world.</p>
<p>MDMA, also sometimes called ecstasy therapy,</p>
<p>is in clinical trials in the US.</p>
<p>It is still an illegal drug to possess or to sell,</p>
<p>so I want to be very clear about that.</p>
<p>However, MDMA is being explored as a potential therapeutic</p>
<p>for PTSD and other forms of trauma.</p>
<p>And of course, ketamine and MDMA</p>
<p>are also both being explored for chronic depression,</p>
<p>eating disorders, and a number of other</p>
<p>psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>But for the moment, I would just like to touch on</p>
<p>ketamine and MDMA as they relate to the fear circuitry</p>
<p>and trauma circuitry that we&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>in the early part of the episode and throughout the episode,</p>
<p>because I think that in viewing them through that lens,</p>
<p>we can gain some additional insight</p>
<p>into how they might be providing the sorts of relief</p>
<p>that some of the early clinical studies</p>
<p>are starting to point to.</p>
<p>Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s a dissociative anesthetic.</p>
<p>Its main function is to create a state of dissociation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never taken ketamine personally,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t describe the experience of it,</p>
<p>but a colleague of mine in psychiatry</p>
<p>shared their experience with a patient&rsquo;s experience of it</p>
<p>as making that patient feel as if, quote,</p>
<p>they were getting out of the cockpit of a plane,</p>
<p>but that they were observing themselves doing it.</p>
<p>And this was, of course, during a approved</p>
<p>therapeutic session that they were doing this,</p>
<p>and they were in some sort of intense visualization</p>
<p>about a traumatic experience.</p>
<p>They were describing some of their depressive symptoms</p>
<p>as well as the trauma.</p>
<p>And the narrative that they basically created</p>
<p>or took away from this, and that was relayed to me,</p>
<p>was one in which the patient felt like</p>
<p>they were in their own body,</p>
<p>but they were also viewing their own body from the outside.</p>
<p>So dissociative, in other words.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ve never had this experience.</p>
<p>Some of you may have with ketamine or through other means,</p>
<p>but we might want to just take a moment</p>
<p>and think about what ketamine actually does</p>
<p>and what dissociation actually does</p>
<p>at the level of neural circuits.</p>
<p>And for that, we can look to this really beautiful paper</p>
<p>that was published by my colleagues,</p>
<p>Karl Deisseroth in psychiatry,</p>
<p>Robert Malenka also in psychiatry,</p>
<p>Legion Low also at Stanford.</p>
<p>They paired up or teamed up rather</p>
<p>to explore how systemic ketamine</p>
<p>adjusts circuitries in the brain.</p>
<p>And what they discovered was that</p>
<p>it changes the rhythm of cortical activity</p>
<p>in certain layers of the cortex.</p>
<p>The cortex is like a layered sandwich.</p>
<p>The cortex, of course, being the outside of the brain.</p>
<p>And there was a particular rhythm,</p>
<p>a one to three Hertz rhythm.</p>
<p>One to three Hertz just means a particular frequency</p>
<p>of electrical activity.</p>
<p>In this case, in these layer five neurons</p>
<p>of retrosplenial cortex.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to know much about retrosplenial cortex</p>
<p>or a one to three Hertz rhythms.</p>
<p>I think the important thing to just take away from this</p>
<p>is that there is now starting to be an understanding</p>
<p>of how drugs like ketamine work</p>
<p>to create this subjective experience</p>
<p>that this patient and other patients</p>
<p>describe as dissociation.</p>
<p>You know, dissociation in its essence</p>
<p>is really about not feeling what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about viewing what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>from a different perspective</p>
<p>than what normally one would view that experience from.</p>
<p>And so if we kind of plug that general notion</p>
<p>of dissociation and ketamine induced dissociation</p>
<p>into the circuit that we talked about before</p>
<p>where we have this threat reflex involved in the amygdala,</p>
<p>these outputs for freezing or for reward in the accumbens.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got this prefrontal narrative coming down</p>
<p>as top-down processing.</p>
<p>It brings us right to that prefrontal cortical input</p>
<p>to the threat system and that narrative.</p>
<p>What seems to be the case in my review</p>
<p>of the paper I just described,</p>
<p>plus a review on how ketamine assisted trauma relief</p>
<p>might work is that it somehow allows the patient,</p>
<p>the individual to recount their trauma</p>
<p>while feeling either none or a very different set</p>
<p>of emotional experiences that they experienced</p>
<p>in the actual trauma or fearful experience.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a remapping of new onto old,</p>
<p>new meaning new feelings onto old feelings</p>
<p>while staying in the exact same narrative.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit like EMDR</p>
<p>of suppressing the threat reflex,</p>
<p>but it seems to bring in a replacement</p>
<p>of previous emotional experiences and sensations</p>
<p>in the body with new ones.</p>
<p>And so in that way, we can sort of view,</p>
<p>or we can try and view ketamine assisted psychotherapy</p>
<p>for the treatment of trauma as bringing together</p>
<p>the three elements that we talked about before.</p>
<p>You want to diminish the intensity,</p>
<p>the potency of the old original trauma experience</p>
<p>or fear experience.</p>
<p>So that seems to be accomplished through this dissociation</p>
<p>and maybe through the kind of anesthetic component.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a reduction in pain in the body,</p>
<p>a dissociation, a kind of observing of the self</p>
<p>that leads to the extinction of the trauma and the fear.</p>
<p>But then there also seems to be an automatic</p>
<p>or kind of built in a relearning of a new narrative</p>
<p>and new set of experiences,</p>
<p>which is the next step that we described earlier.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an intriguing therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s really catching on</p>
<p>and there are many, many clinics around the US</p>
<p>that are now doing it.</p>
<p>Whether or not it turns out to be the ultimate treatment</p>
<p>for trauma and for fear, isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>My colleagues in psychiatry tell me that that&rsquo;s unlikely,</p>
<p>although it does seem to be beneficial</p>
<p>for a number of people,</p>
<p>especially people that are experiencing trauma</p>
<p>or have existing traumas and fear</p>
<p>that are coupled with depressive symptoms</p>
<p>because the data on ketamine and depression</p>
<p>seems to be quite strong.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about MDMA.</p>
<p>MDMA also sometimes called ecstasy or molly</p>
<p>in its recreational form is a powerful synthetic drug</p>
<p>that at least as far as we know,</p>
<p>creates a state in the brain and body</p>
<p>that is unlike any other chemical state</p>
<p>in the brain and body that&rsquo;s normally experienced.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, we have several neuromodulator systems in our body.</p>
<p>Neuromodulators are chemicals that change the likelihood</p>
<p>that certain neural circuits will be active,</p>
<p>meaning they can make it very likely</p>
<p>that certain circuits will be active</p>
<p>and make it very unlikely</p>
<p>that other neural circuits will be active.</p>
<p>Good examples of neuromodulators are dopamine,</p>
<p>serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine.</p>
<p>These tend to work on different systems</p>
<p>in the brain and body,</p>
<p>but they tend to be activated more or less in parallel.</p>
<p>You can have dopamine released in your brain</p>
<p>and also norepinephrine.</p>
<p>You can have serotonin released in your brain</p>
<p>and also acetylcholine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an all or none kind of thing,</p>
<p>but the degrees to which these things are activated</p>
<p>tends to vary.</p>
<p>And there is a little bit of a seesaw type phenomenon</p>
<p>with dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>Dopamine most commonly associated</p>
<p>with activating neural circuits</p>
<p>related to motivation, craving, and reward.</p>
<p>And serotonin more typically activated</p>
<p>in response to situations or conditions</p>
<p>in which we are very happy and content with what we have.</p>
<p>So dopamine is more about pursuing and seeking.</p>
<p>Serotonin is more about kind of pleasure and satisfaction</p>
<p>with resources that we have in our immediate sphere.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tend to,</p>
<p>serotonin doesn&rsquo;t tend to place the brain and body</p>
<p>into a mode of action quite as much as dopamine does,</p>
<p>more or less.</p>
<p>MDMA is a unique compound</p>
<p>in that it leads to very large increases</p>
<p>in the amount of both dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>in the brain and body simultaneously.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a unique circumstance</p>
<p>that is just simply not seen under normal conditions.</p>
<p>From a subjective standpoint,</p>
<p>people under the influence of MDMA</p>
<p>in the therapeutic setting</p>
<p>tend to report immense feelings of connection</p>
<p>or resonance with people or even things,</p>
<p>with music, with objects.</p>
<p>Certainly if it&rsquo;s being done in conjunction</p>
<p>with a family member or a partner or with a therapist,</p>
<p>they will feel extremely connected to that person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll feel a very close understanding and association,</p>
<p>oftentimes that goes beyond words.</p>
<p>There is a chemical reason for that.</p>
<p>It turns out that MDMA causes massive release of oxytocin,</p>
<p>this neuropeptide that&rsquo;s associated with pair bonding</p>
<p>and with bonding generally.</p>
<p>The oxytocin system and the serotonin system</p>
<p>are closely linked to one another in the brain and body,</p>
<p>and they tend to be co-released often at the same times</p>
<p>and by the same sorts of events.</p>
<p>So MDMA is one mechanism</p>
<p>by which oxytocin is released in these massive amounts.</p>
<p>And I should just relay some of the levels of oxytocin</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re really quite striking,</p>
<p>gives a kind of a more vivid picture</p>
<p>of why it is that MDMA would make people feel</p>
<p>so associated in a positive way</p>
<p>with the various things that are happening to them</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re under the influence of the drug.</p>
<p>So the paper related to this that I&rsquo;d like to highlight</p>
<p>is in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Plasma Oxytocin Concentrations Following MDMA</p>
<p>or Intranasal Oxytocin in Humans.</p>
<p>And just remarkably MDMA increased plasma oxytocin levels</p>
<p>to 83.7, this is an average,</p>
<p>83.7 picograms per milliliter,</p>
<p>about 90 to 120 minutes into the MDMA session</p>
<p>compared to a typical level of 18.6.</p>
<p>So this is a massive increase in oxytocin.</p>
<p>And I think that massive increase in oxytocin</p>
<p>is part of the reason why people have these feelings</p>
<p>of close resonance and association.</p>
<p>Now, the dopamine increases are generally what lead</p>
<p>to the feelings of euphoria inside of the MDMA session.</p>
<p>And then the serotonin increases it is thought</p>
<p>are what lead to the feelings of safety and comfort.</p>
<p>So again, a very unusual chemical cocktail</p>
<p>that would never be seen,</p>
<p>at least not at this amplitude under any normal conditions</p>
<p>outside of an MDMA clinical psychotherapeutic session.</p>
<p>Why would this state of mind and body be potentially useful</p>
<p>for the treatment of trauma?</p>
<p>Well, indeed it is revealing itself to be useful</p>
<p>for the treatment of trauma.</p>
<p>Again, these are legal clinical trials</p>
<p>where people are doing this and discovering this.</p>
<p>What it seems to allow is a very fast relearning</p>
<p>or new associations to be tacked on</p>
<p>to the previously traumatic experience.</p>
<p>So again, it brings us back to the same model</p>
<p>of how people extinguish fears and traumas</p>
<p>and replace them with new experiences</p>
<p>when there is no drug treatment involved.</p>
<p>There needs to be a diminishing of the old experience,</p>
<p>meaning an extinction,</p>
<p>and then a relearning of a new narrative.</p>
<p>What the chemical milieu of MDMA seems to be doing</p>
<p>is creating an opportunity for all that to happen very fast</p>
<p>without the need for many repetitions of the original trauma</p>
<p>and reliving of the original trauma,</p>
<p>probably because the reliving of it</p>
<p>inside of one of these MDMA sessions</p>
<p>is very acute, very intense.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems to be offering the opportunity</p>
<p>to extinguish and rewrite in</p>
<p>or write in a new narrative associated with that trauma</p>
<p>very quickly as well.</p>
<p>So what this means is that treatments like MDMA</p>
<p>that are under investigation in these clinical trials</p>
<p>are unlikely to be magic potions, if you will,</p>
<p>that allow access to a particular process</p>
<p>that would otherwise not be accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more that the typical process</p>
<p>of trauma and fear reduction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s carried out in things like prolonged exposure,</p>
<p>cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>seems to be compacted into a much shorter session</p>
<p>and that session is performed at a much higher intensity,</p>
<p>higher intensity because the chemical milieu of the brain</p>
<p>is completely different.</p>
<p>I mean, the experience of MDMA</p>
<p>is one in which people have a very heightened</p>
<p>sense of euphoria, a very heightened sense of connection.</p>
<p>So those positive experiences are essentially primed</p>
<p>to be written in and over the traumatic experience.</p>
<p>And because of the high levels of serotonin in the system</p>
<p>and probably oxytocin as well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a safety that&rsquo;s written into the situation</p>
<p>that allows people to lean into perhaps narratives</p>
<p>or components of narratives</p>
<p>that they would otherwise be holding back from.</p>
<p>So these are powerful compounds.</p>
<p>And I think the future of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy</p>
<p>for trauma in particular is holding great promise as of now,</p>
<p>meaning at the time of the recording of this podcast.</p>
<p>Again, I want to reiterate that these are clinical trials</p>
<p>that are being done legally.</p>
<p>These drugs are still illegal to possess</p>
<p>or sell outside of clinical trials.</p>
<p>Doing this sort of thing is punishable,</p>
<p>but it does seem that the FDA</p>
<p>and some of the related bodies</p>
<p>that control these sorts of things</p>
<p>are eyes open to this stuff.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very likely in the next few years,</p>
<p>things like MDMA and certainly ketamine</p>
<p>is already in widespread use</p>
<p>within the psychiatric community.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re going to be seeing a lot more of that.</p>
<p>One thing we have not touched on yet</p>
<p>is how do you know if you&rsquo;re traumatized?</p>
<p>How do you know if you have chronic fear</p>
<p>or a debilitating fear?</p>
<p>Much of the psychiatric community focuses</p>
<p>on how many other problems people might have,</p>
<p>trouble sleeping, trouble eating,</p>
<p>trouble maintaining quality work or schoolwork and so forth.</p>
<p>And all of those are certainly very valid criteria</p>
<p>and necessary criteria for determining</p>
<p>whether or not somebody meets clinical diagnosis or not.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a biological component</p>
<p>that I think we can all assess for ourselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of interoceptive versus exteroceptive balance</p>
<p>and that sounds confusing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually really easy to understand.</p>
<p>We can focus our perception on the external world,</p>
<p>events going on around us beyond the confines of our skin</p>
<p>or within the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>A focus and a perception on the external world</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called exteroception.</p>
<p>And a focus on what&rsquo;s happening inside us is interoception.</p>
<p>And we have the capacity</p>
<p>to build mental appraisal into that, right?</p>
<p>I can, for instance, stop for a moment</p>
<p>and assess how my stomach feels, how hungry I feel,</p>
<p>how quick my heart is beating.</p>
<p>Some people, by the way, are much better at sensing</p>
<p>whether or not their heart is beating at a particular rate</p>
<p>and others, not so much.</p>
<p>Some people can actually count their heartbeats</p>
<p>without having to take their pulse</p>
<p>by placing pressure on their wrist or their neck.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In other words, some people have</p>
<p>very high interoceptive awareness and other people less so.</p>
<p>This whole business of fear and trauma</p>
<p>relates to taking external experiences</p>
<p>and funneling those experiences into this thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m calling a threat reflex or the fear circuitry.</p>
<p>A recent paper published in the journal Science,</p>
<p>so absolutely spectacular journal,</p>
<p>Science, Nature, and Cell</p>
<p>being the apex journals of scientific publishing,</p>
<p>gets at this issue of where in our mind</p>
<p>and how do we assess whether or not</p>
<p>what we are feeling internally is reasonable</p>
<p>given what&rsquo;s going on externally.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really fascinating study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to highlight a little bit of it for you</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll touch on some of the relevant aspects</p>
<p>and how that can be adopted into a practice</p>
<p>to assess and reduce fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>The title of this paper,</p>
<p>published just a few weeks ago in Science,</p>
<p>is Fear Balance is Maintained by Bodily Feedback</p>
<p>to the Insular Cortex in Mice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve not talked too much about the insula,</p>
<p>also called the insular cortex.</p>
<p>This is a brain area that my lab has worked on</p>
<p>and other labs have worked on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brain area that has within it a map</p>
<p>of our internal interoceptive landscape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a map of our internal bodily sensations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting structure.</p>
<p>So the way this study was carried out</p>
<p>is that subjects were taught or conditioned</p>
<p>to a particular danger signal</p>
<p>through repeated presentation of a sound with a foot shock.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sound and there&rsquo;s a foot shock.</p>
<p>And as you know from our earlier discussion</p>
<p>about Pavlovian learning,</p>
<p>conditioned stimuli and unconditioned stimuli,</p>
<p>eventually the sound alone comes to evoke the fear response.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just classical conditioning.</p>
<p>The insula is this brain area that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with determining whether or not one&rsquo;s internal sensations,</p>
<p>gut, heart, lungs, et cetera,</p>
<p>are reasonable or not given the external circumstances.</p>
<p>It can even measure or is associated</p>
<p>with our understanding</p>
<p>of what are called atrial baroreceptors.</p>
<p>These are blood pressure sensors.</p>
<p>So believe it or not, when your pulse rate increases</p>
<p>or you feel like you&rsquo;re stressed out,</p>
<p>your atrial baroreceptors are sending a signal</p>
<p>to your insular cortex and your insular cortex is saying,</p>
<p>wow, I&rsquo;m really stressed out, my blood pressure is up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually have to measure your blood pressure</p>
<p>with a cuff, your insula is doing it for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not getting a quantitative readout,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s getting a qualitative readout.</p>
<p>The main effect of inhibiting</p>
<p>or reducing the activity of the insula</p>
<p>was that the intensity of an outside world experience</p>
<p>led to a range of different internal effects.</p>
<p>In other words, for most people,</p>
<p>a mild shock would induce a mild increase in heart rate,</p>
<p>a mild increase in blood pressure,</p>
<p>whereas an intense shock to the skin</p>
<p>would lead to a big increase in heart rate</p>
<p>and a big increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Turns out the insula is important</p>
<p>for establishing that match of intensity.</p>
<p>And when the insula is inhibited,</p>
<p>what ends up happening is that a mild shock</p>
<p>can create a big increase in blood pressure</p>
<p>and that can be maintained such that</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s paired with that shock,</p>
<p>like a bell or a tone</p>
<p>would lead to a big increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen examples of this in the real world.</p>
<p>Maybe this is even you.</p>
<p>Some people are very jumpy in response</p>
<p>to just even small changes in their environment.</p>
<p>So if somebody&rsquo;s working and you walk in</p>
<p>and you say, hello, and they&rsquo;ll go,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of, they&rsquo;re jumpy.</p>
<p>They have a low threshold to a big anxiety or fear response.</p>
<p>Other people are really calm.</p>
<p>I recall my bulldog, unfortunately he passed away,</p>
<p>but before he passed away,</p>
<p>if you walked in the room and you said,</p>
<p>hey Costello, he might turn his eyes in your direction.</p>
<p>He had a very high threshold to respond.</p>
<p>He was pretty low anxiety animal.</p>
<p>A lot of people are like that.</p>
<p>You come up behind someone, you say, hello,</p>
<p>and they just turn around real slow</p>
<p>or they might just turn around at normal speed</p>
<p>and say, hello.</p>
<p>Whereas other people would jump out of their seat.</p>
<p>The insula seems to be involved in calibrating</p>
<p>how big or how high amplitude</p>
<p>a given physiological response is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pairing the internal landscape</p>
<p>with the external world.</p>
<p>And this might seem like just a mechanistic</p>
<p>but non-actionable point.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;ll see from the next study</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to describe is that recalibrating</p>
<p>the relationship between outside events</p>
<p>and internal responses, which is the job of the insula</p>
<p>is actually something that&rsquo;s under our control.</p>
<p>And through a very simple, very short protocol,</p>
<p>we can actually recalibrate that system so much so</p>
<p>that we can potentially reduce the amount of fear and trauma</p>
<p>that we experience in response to a memory</p>
<p>or to a real event.</p>
<p>And the entire process can occur very quickly.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really excited to tell you about this next study</p>
<p>for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s extremely recent.</p>
<p>Second of all, it&rsquo;s very well grounded</p>
<p>in our current understanding of the mechanisms</p>
<p>of stress, trauma, and PTSD</p>
<p>and unlearning of stress, trauma, and PTSD.</p>
<p>And third, it points to a actionable protocol</p>
<p>that while certainly is not the only approach</p>
<p>that I think people could or should take</p>
<p>for fear, trauma, and PTSD,</p>
<p>is one that I think we are going to see implemented</p>
<p>into the clinical setting very soon</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not happening already.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a fourth reason I&rsquo;m very interested in it,</p>
<p>which is that my lab works on stress, stress relief,</p>
<p>and tools for managing sleep and improving focus, et cetera.</p>
<p>And one of the hallmarks of the studies</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been doing lately</p>
<p>is very brief five-minute-a-day interventions</p>
<p>of the sort that was used in this particular study,</p>
<p>although I should emphasize I had nothing to do</p>
<p>with this particular study.</p>
<p>Now, this particular study was carried out</p>
<p>in an animal model, in mice.</p>
<p>The work in my laboratory focuses on human subjects,</p>
<p>but the similarities of the stress system,</p>
<p>at least at the level that it was explored in this study,</p>
<p>I think have great relevance,</p>
<p>maybe even direct relevance to humans.</p>
<p>So the title of this study is</p>
<p>Repeated Exposure with Short-Term Behavioral Stress</p>
<p>Resolves Pre-Existing Stress-Induced</p>
<p>Depressive-Like Behavior in Mice.</p>
<p>Again, this study was in mice.</p>
<p>And basically what they did is they stressed out mice,</p>
<p>got them depressed,</p>
<p>and you actually can do that in a mouse,</p>
<p>using a restraint protocol,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a long-lasting restraint protocol</p>
<p>of 15 minutes or more.</p>
<p>Mice don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>You do it often enough.</p>
<p>They stop working so hard in their life,</p>
<p>in their mouse life, to gain food, to gain mates.</p>
<p>They show depressive symptoms at a number of levels.</p>
<p>They show elevated glucocorticoids.</p>
<p>You see the same thing in humans, okay?</p>
<p>Chronic stress in humans lasting weeks or more</p>
<p>does the same exact thing.</p>
<p>So again, a very close match here</p>
<p>in terms of mechanism overall.</p>
<p>And then what they did was a very counterintuitive thing.</p>
<p>Rather than give these animals stress relief</p>
<p>at the level of reducing their anxiety with benzodiazepines</p>
<p>or giving them a nice little mouse vacation</p>
<p>or enhanced or enriched environment,</p>
<p>things that have been done in a lot of previous studies,</p>
<p>what they did is they subjected them</p>
<p>to five minutes a day of intense stress,</p>
<p>but only five minutes a day.</p>
<p>And what they found was miraculously,</p>
<p>but also very convincingly,</p>
<p>daily short bouts of intense stress actually undid,</p>
<p>reversed the effects of chronic stress.</p>
<p>And it did this at the level of glucocorticoids,</p>
<p>of hormones, of neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>and a number of other different mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now, I find this very exciting for a number of reasons,</p>
<p>but in particular, because my laboratory,</p>
<p>in collaboration with David Spiegel&rsquo;s laboratory,</p>
<p>our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford,</p>
<p>been exploring how five minute a day respiration protocols</p>
<p>can alleviate stress.</p>
<p>And while those data are not yet published,</p>
<p>they are at the stage</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m comfortable talking about them.</p>
<p>And we are seeing some very impressive</p>
<p>and significant effects on stress reduction,</p>
<p>not just from respiration protocols</p>
<p>that allow people to calm themselves,</p>
<p>but also respiration protocols that bring people</p>
<p>into a heightened state of autonomic sympathetic arousal,</p>
<p>AKA stress.</p>
<p>As my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an MD, psychiatrist, and PhD,</p>
<p>likes to say, when it comes to trauma, anxiety, and PTSD,</p>
<p>and the treatment of trauma, anxiety, and PTSD,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the state that you are in</p>
<p>or that you go into, it&rsquo;s how you got there</p>
<p>and whether or not you had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>And this brings us right back to those top-down mechanisms</p>
<p>and the narrative around</p>
<p>what we are experiencing internally.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s zoom out and I&rsquo;ll explain how this works</p>
<p>and what to do about it.</p>
<p>We have this brain structure called the insula.</p>
<p>We talked about the insula a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>The insula is calibrating how we feel internally</p>
<p>versus what&rsquo;s going on externally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in setting whether or not</p>
<p>what we are feeling is appropriate given what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>We have a system that can generate threat responses.</p>
<p>And in the case of trauma, PTSD, and extreme stress,</p>
<p>chronic stress, that system gets ramped up</p>
<p>so that it takes very little, maybe even just a memory</p>
<p>or maybe even an association that we&rsquo;re not even aware of,</p>
<p>you know, a location triggers something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even aware of it,</p>
<p>and we start experiencing that symptomology.</p>
<p>How do we recalibrate the system?</p>
<p>Well, most of the approaches that are out there</p>
<p>involving drug treatments,</p>
<p>typical drug treatments would involve</p>
<p>suppressing the level of internal arousal,</p>
<p>just trying to bring that down.</p>
<p>Now, some of those drug treatments work,</p>
<p>but oftentimes they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not surprising that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because by taking a drug that just lowers your anxiety,</p>
<p>overall, you&rsquo;re creating a different</p>
<p>sort of miscalibration of the system.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ve been doing in human subjects</p>
<p>is having them do either breathing protocols that calm them,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain what that is in a moment,</p>
<p>or doing breathing protocols that increase their level</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal and seeing how that impacts</p>
<p>their response to stress overall,</p>
<p>not just during that particular breathing protocol.</p>
<p>So the calming protocol that we use</p>
<p>involves these physiological sighs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about these previously</p>
<p>on the podcast and elsewhere,</p>
<p>but if you just need a reminder,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t heard about it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pattern of breathing that we all do in sleep</p>
<p>when our carbon dioxide levels in our bloodstream</p>
<p>get too high, and we do this when we get claustrophobic,</p>
<p>meaning we do it reflexively,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a double inhale through the nose</p>
<p>followed by a long exhale.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and yes, the inhales should be through the nose,</p>
<p>and yes, the exhales should be done</p>
<p>through the mouth ideally.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big filling of the lungs</p>
<p>through two breaths back-to-back inhales,</p>
<p>even if you can only sneak in a little air</p>
<p>on that second one,</p>
<p>no talking if you&rsquo;re going to do it right,</p>
<p>and then a long exhale,</p>
<p>which allows you to offload a lot of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>in the exhale.</p>
<p>And we have people doing that in real time,</p>
<p>anytime they experience stress,</p>
<p>but the particular breathing protocol</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been giving human subjects</p>
<p>is for them to do the repeated,</p>
<p>what we call cyclic sighing.</p>
<p>So double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>double inhale, exhale, repeatedly for five minutes,</p>
<p>which is actually a pretty long time to repeat that,</p>
<p>but you can do it pretty slowly.</p>
<p>And people report,</p>
<p>and the data point to the fact that it&rsquo;s very calming.</p>
<p>People feel more relaxed afterwards,</p>
<p>and that relaxation wicks out</p>
<p>into other aspects of their life.</p>
<p>Now, we did not look at stress and trauma</p>
<p>in that condition.</p>
<p>We also have another condition</p>
<p>where people do what&rsquo;s called cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>which is very different</p>
<p>and creates a very different internal state</p>
<p>and is somewhat stressful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s five minutes a day of stress,</p>
<p>much like the study that I just described.</p>
<p>And it involves basically doing this,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll do in a moment,</p>
<p>for five minutes, which is hyperventilating,</p>
<p>which is,</p>
<p>ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,</p>
<p>but not continuously for the five minutes</p>
<p>because many people would pass out</p>
<p>or feel extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It involves inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, very deep,</p>
<p>inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.</p>
<p>And then every 25 or 30 breaths or so,</p>
<p>doing a full exhale and holding one&rsquo;s breath,</p>
<p>lungs empty for about 25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds,</p>
<p>and then continuing until five minutes is up.</p>
<p>Subjects report and our data indicate</p>
<p>that people feel a heightened level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>In fact, I can feel it right now,</p>
<p>even from that very brief cyclic hyperventilation bout</p>
<p>I just did.</p>
<p>You feel a heating up.</p>
<p>You feel a, some people will perspire.</p>
<p>Some people get wide-eyed.</p>
<p>Some people feel agitated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s adrenaline being released into your system.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not suggesting everyone run out and do this.</p>
<p>And if you have a predisposition to panic attack</p>
<p>or anxiety attacks, please don&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>because it is very stimulating</p>
<p>and can trigger those sorts of attacks.</p>
<p>But this five minute a day protocol</p>
<p>of cyclic hyperventilation does lead to big increases</p>
<p>in autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s stressful in air quotes,</p>
<p>but to bring us back to the,</p>
<p>my colleague, David Spiegel&rsquo;s quote,</p>
<p>it really was him that said it, not me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the state that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the state that you&rsquo;re in plus how you got there</p>
<p>and whether or not you directed entry into that state.</p>
<p>And that point of that one directs their own entry</p>
<p>into a state deliberately is really key.</p>
<p>And I think it has an important implications</p>
<p>for whether or not there&rsquo;s stress relief and fear relief</p>
<p>and trauma relief from bringing oneself</p>
<p>into a state of increased autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of the way that that fear</p>
<p>and trauma circuitry is organized.</p>
<p>If you recall, it&rsquo;s got these components</p>
<p>of how external events can trigger</p>
<p>an internal stress response and fear response</p>
<p>and trauma response,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s that top-down prefrontal component</p>
<p>that can inhibit certain aspects</p>
<p>of that fear and threat circuitry.</p>
<p>Now, earlier we were talking about that prefrontal circuit</p>
<p>being engaged through narrative,</p>
<p>through self-directed deliberate narrative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the person deliberately retelling the story.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re talking about a deliberate reactivation</p>
<p>of the sensations in the body.</p>
<p>So where I think this is all going,</p>
<p>meaning where my laboratory and the Spiegel Laboratory</p>
<p>and other laboratories out there are taking this,</p>
<p>is you can imagine a very brief five minutes a day,</p>
<p>two weeks was the time that they did this</p>
<p>for five minutes a day for two weeks,</p>
<p>intervention in which people</p>
<p>with the support of a clinician, we would hope,</p>
<p>would deliberately induce a physiological state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very stressful, right?</p>
<p>Not shying away from the stress response,</p>
<p>but increasing their own stress response deliberately</p>
<p>and maybe in conjunction with recounting</p>
<p>the traumatic or fearful circumstance.</p>
<p>This is far and away different</p>
<p>than the kind of state of mind and body</p>
<p>that would come about in a ketamine-assisted</p>
<p>trauma-induced psychotherapy session</p>
<p>or a MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session,</p>
<p>or in a purely narrative-based psychotherapy session</p>
<p>aimed at alleviating fear or trauma.</p>
<p>The reason I like these sorts of interventions</p>
<p>is that A, they are very low cost or even zero cost, right?</p>
<p>One could, you could imagine doing this while journaling</p>
<p>or while recounting a particular experience.</p>
<p>Again, they&rsquo;re very compact.</p>
<p>Five minutes a day for two weeks</p>
<p>is what was done in this particular mouse study.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if that translates directly</p>
<p>to the human study or not.</p>
<p>What was interesting is that if they used</p>
<p>longer daily bouts of stress, like 15 minutes a day,</p>
<p>that actually exacerbated the trauma</p>
<p>and exacerbated the fear.</p>
<p>So one has to be very careful.</p>
<p>Stress and deliberate entry into stress</p>
<p>and self-stressing are very potent tools.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very sharp blades that it does appear,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s likely can help alleviate trauma and fear.</p>
<p>But how long to do this,</p>
<p>exactly what the protocol should be</p>
<p>is still something that needs to be cultivated.</p>
<p>I know there are going to be people out there</p>
<p>that nonetheless are going to want to experiment</p>
<p>with some of this.</p>
<p>I will say that I do not think it matters</p>
<p>how one gets into that stressed state,</p>
<p>provided it is self-directed.</p>
<p>And that therefore could be called shower.</p>
<p>It could be ice bath.</p>
<p>It could be anything that induces an acute,</p>
<p>meaning a sudden onset of adrenaline and is self-directed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the key feature here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited about these data,</p>
<p>both the five-minute intervention data</p>
<p>from the animal study,</p>
<p>the work that&rsquo;s ongoing in my laboratory</p>
<p>and Dr. Spiegel&rsquo;s laboratory,</p>
<p>and the work that&rsquo;s being done on the insula.</p>
<p>Because I think what we&rsquo;re starting to see now</p>
<p>is a picture of fear and trauma and PTSD</p>
<p>that has this sensory component,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the world around us,</p>
<p>this internal and terraceptive component,</p>
<p>how appropriate are the signals</p>
<p>that are occurring in my body?</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s face it,</p>
<p>if you almost get hit by a car</p>
<p>and your heart rate is 140 beats per second,</p>
<p>and that lasts for a little while</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of stressed out</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get the best night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty normal.</p>
<p>That means you have a healthy fear system.</p>
<p>If that persists and you&rsquo;re dealing with a lot of issues</p>
<p>a week later, six weeks later, two years later,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s moved into the realm of trauma and PTSD.</p>
<p>So we need to always be taking into account</p>
<p>the different components of the circuitry.</p>
<p>I do think that deliberate self-directed entry</p>
<p>into these short bouts of stress</p>
<p>is a very promising approach.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that if people are going to experiment,</p>
<p>I just, again, want to caution people</p>
<p>with anxiety or panic disorders,</p>
<p>be very cautious, probably don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would do this in conjunction</p>
<p>with support from a clinician.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also aware that there are a lot of people out there</p>
<p>that are dealing with trauma</p>
<p>and dealing with post-traumatic stress of various kinds,</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re desperate</p>
<p>for various self-directed intervention approaches.</p>
<p>So just very briefly,</p>
<p>I want to touch on some of the lifestyle</p>
<p>and supplementation factors that can impact things</p>
<p>like fear and trauma and getting over fear and trauma.</p>
<p>To make a long story short,</p>
<p>there are many things that we all can and should do</p>
<p>to support our overall mental and physical health.</p>
<p>And these are the foundational elements</p>
<p>of quality nutrition, what that means to you,</p>
<p>quality sleep on a regular basis,</p>
<p>ample sleep on a regular basis.</p>
<p>We have an episode on how to master sleep.</p>
<p>In fact, we have four episodes</p>
<p>that you can go to hubermanlab.com or elsewhere</p>
<p>and scroll down, and you can find those episodes</p>
<p>in order to get your sleep really dialed in, as they say.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sleeping regularly and for sufficient duration,</p>
<p>all of the systems of your fear circuitry</p>
<p>are going to function better,</p>
<p>mainly because the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>becomes very dysregulated</p>
<p>when we are not getting good sleep on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Dysregulated means that out of nowhere,</p>
<p>we can have a higher propensity</p>
<p>to have sympathetic activation,</p>
<p>or we can feel really tired and wired.</p>
<p>You know, that seesaw that I described earlier</p>
<p>of alertness and calmness,</p>
<p>of sympathetic and parasympathetic,</p>
<p>in that analogy, we can imagine that seesaw has a hinge</p>
<p>and that hinge can neither be too tight nor too loose.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too tight,</p>
<p>you can get locked into chronic activation of alertness</p>
<p>or chronic fatigue.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too loose, you&rsquo;re bouncing all over the place</p>
<p>and you might be real tired and wired one moment,</p>
<p>and then, you know, really hyper alert.</p>
<p>Sleep resets that balance and resets that hinge</p>
<p>to the appropriate tightness, if you will,</p>
<p>so that all these circuits,</p>
<p>and not just the circuits related to fear,</p>
<p>but also the circuits related to cognition,</p>
<p>clear thinking, to be able to spell out</p>
<p>very clear, detailed narratives,</p>
<p>to feel like you are in control.</p>
<p>You are deliberately bringing yourself into these protocols,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you intend to use.</p>
<p>All of that functions much better</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sleeping well and eating well.</p>
<p>We talked about social connection.</p>
<p>Those are all indirect supports of trauma relief</p>
<p>and of getting over fear, but they are essential, okay?</p>
<p>I think of them sort of like the tide.</p>
<p>When the tide is high enough, a boat can leave harbor,</p>
<p>and if the tide is not high enough,</p>
<p>then that boat is going to be stranded on shore,</p>
<p>and in this analogy, the boat stranded on shore</p>
<p>is your attempt or anybody&rsquo;s attempt</p>
<p>to try and work through something.</p>
<p>Very hard to do when we&rsquo;re sleep deprived.</p>
<p>Very hard to do when we&rsquo;re not fed enough</p>
<p>or fed the proper foods for you,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a highly individual thing,</p>
<p>and social connection, as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>creates a general sense of support</p>
<p>for the ability to move through things,</p>
<p>but also chemical support</p>
<p>at the level of suppressing tachychinin, okay?</p>
<p>So those foundational elements are absolutely key,</p>
<p>but they are indirect.</p>
<p>I just want to briefly mention a few of the things</p>
<p>that some people find great benefit from</p>
<p>in the supplementation realm</p>
<p>as it relates to anxiety, stress, fear, and PTSD,</p>
<p>but I want to point out that, again,</p>
<p>these are somewhat indirect in their support,</p>
<p>and most of them focus on reducing anxiety overall.</p>
<p>The two that I want to focus on</p>
<p>are two that I&rsquo;ve never talked about on this podcast before</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve done podcasts before on stress</p>
<p>and managing stress in the kind of shorter term,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve talked about ashwagandha in a previous podcast.</p>
<p>Check out the podcast on stress</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in how that might be relevant</p>
<p>as well as other tools,</p>
<p>but the two are interesting ones.</p>
<p>The first one is saffron, of all things,</p>
<p>but there are 12 studies, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that orally ingested saffron at 30 milligrams</p>
<p>seems to be a reliable dose for reducing anxiety</p>
<p>on the standard inventories,</p>
<p>the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,</p>
<p>for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>and these are significant effects,</p>
<p>and these were carried out in both male and female subjects.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m only referring to human studies.</p>
<p>Several of these were double-blind studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a meta-analysis of the positive effects,</p>
<p>meaning anxiolytic effects,</p>
<p>anxiety-reducing effects, that is, of things like saffron.</p>
<p>Definitely have to check with your doctor,</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re fairly impressive effects</p>
<p>when you really think about it,</p>
<p>given that these are legal over-the-counter substances.</p>
<p>Again, check with a doctor.</p>
<p>The other one is inositol.</p>
<p>Inositol has been shown to create</p>
<p>a very notable decrease in anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fairly high dose that&rsquo;s used,</p>
<p>but believe it or not,</p>
<p>the potency of this effect is on par</p>
<p>with many of the prescription antidepressants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>These studies, again, are double-blind studies</p>
<p>that all showed decreases in anxiety.</p>
<p>These were done in males and females.</p>
<p>The age range is very broad, which is great,</p>
<p>18 all the way up to 64 across the studies that I looked at.</p>
<p>One of the more important things</p>
<p>is that the dosages are quite high,</p>
<p>18 grams of inositol taken for a full month,</p>
<p>and it does take some time</p>
<p>for these symptoms of anxiety to be improved.</p>
<p>The low dose range was about 12 grams of inositol,</p>
<p>so as high as 18, as low as 12 grams.</p>
<p>But then again, pretty impressive results</p>
<p>considering that these are</p>
<p>over-the-counter supplement compounds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even some evidence, I should just mention,</p>
<p>that the inositol is also used</p>
<p>for things like obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>We will do a full episode on OCD in the future.</p>
<p>You can count on that.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, inositol does seem</p>
<p>to have some positive effects on anxiety,</p>
<p>and therefore, it might provide</p>
<p>a kind of supportive indirect effect</p>
<p>for people that are trying to work through trauma and PTSD.</p>
<p>Now, the question is, when would you take it?</p>
<p>Well, by the logic of what we spelled out today,</p>
<p>you probably would not want to take it during a session</p>
<p>or prior to a session where you were trying</p>
<p>to amplify the intensity of an experience</p>
<p>and the recounting of an experience</p>
<p>in efforts to eventually extinguish that experience, right?</p>
<p>Because if you put a drug or a compound of any kind,</p>
<p>prescription drug or supplement of any kind,</p>
<p>into your system, you are essentially short-circuiting</p>
<p>the extinguishing effect, right?</p>
<p>So you could imagine doing this outside of that session</p>
<p>as a way to kind of bring your system</p>
<p>back to baseline, perhaps.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to use these sorts of things,</p>
<p>you want to think about them logically.</p>
<p>And this also really points to the fact</p>
<p>that many of the things that people are doing out there</p>
<p>to self-medicate over use of alcohol or other substances</p>
<p>to try and calm themselves</p>
<p>because they have fear, anxiety, and PTSD</p>
<p>are actually driving that fear, anxiety, and PTSD</p>
<p>deeper into their system,</p>
<p>or at least is not allowing it to relieve itself</p>
<p>through any attempts to recount or replay</p>
<p>and using these top-down narrative circuits</p>
<p>or other approaches.</p>
<p>And the last compound I want to mention</p>
<p>is a particularly interesting one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s neither an anxiolytic,</p>
<p>nor is it something that increases overall levels</p>
<p>of stress and alertness,</p>
<p>but it has some kind of MDMA-ish-like contour to it.</p>
<p>It does not produce, as far as we know,</p>
<p>the same mental effects or physical effects as MDMA</p>
<p>by any stretch,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the substance that I&rsquo;m referring to rather</p>
<p>is kava.</p>
<p>Kava has been shown in eight studies</p>
<p>to have a very potent effect on reducing anxiety,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s interesting about kava</p>
<p>is that kava functions by increasing GABA,</p>
<p>this inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.</p>
<p>Remember, GABA is the inhibitory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that is used, that&rsquo;s employed by the very neurons</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that serve to inhibit the threat reflex.</p>
<p>So it seems to increase GABA, but it also increases dopamine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a somewhat unusual compound.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of many compounds</p>
<p>that simultaneously increase GABA and increase dopamine.</p>
<p>And as you recall, that threat reflex has outputs</p>
<p>that tap into the dopamine system.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a big leap to go from a compound</p>
<p>that increases GABA and dopamine</p>
<p>and look at a circuit spelled out on paper in front of us</p>
<p>and say, oh, well, there&rsquo;s GABA and dopamine in this circuit</p>
<p>and therefore this is a good compound to take.</p>
<p>But the effects of kava in human studies</p>
<p>are pretty interesting as it relates to anxiety,</p>
<p>stress, PTSD, and fear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to summarize all of these</p>
<p>because there are eight studies that I&rsquo;m aware of,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just mention again, these are double-blind studies.</p>
<p>So the trial design is solid.</p>
<p>The age ranges are anywhere from 18 to 64,</p>
<p>which is a nice broad age range.</p>
<p>The number of subjects is quite high, both men and women,</p>
<p>no signs of hepatotoxic signals,</p>
<p>so meaning a liver toxicity,</p>
<p>although of course, check with your doctor.</p>
<p>But what was interesting is that</p>
<p>after a period of about three weeks of treatment</p>
<p>with anywhere from 150 milligrams</p>
<p>of what are called active kava lactones,</p>
<p>okay, so there are dosages that relate to that kava.</p>
<p>So 100 milligrams of extract of kava</p>
<p>is a kind of a reasonable typical dose in these studies,</p>
<p>but that spells out to a certain amount of kava lactones.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of boil down</p>
<p>to what is the appropriate dosage.</p>
<p>And it turns out it&rsquo;s extremely broad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see evidence of 50 milligrams,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see evidence of 300 milligrams,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of all over the place.</p>
<p>But each of these studies alone and together</p>
<p>point to the fact that kava does seem to produce</p>
<p>a very potent anxiolytic and general kind of improvement</p>
<p>in depressive symptoms</p>
<p>and reduction in generalized anxiety across the board.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting compound.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually tried</p>
<p>any of the compounds I just mentioned.</p>
<p>Kava, saffron, or anisotol.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t report on them personally.</p>
<p>I just know that a number of listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>are interested in supplements</p>
<p>and legal over-the-counter approaches</p>
<p>to their biology and psychology.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I mentioned them.</p>
<p>Those were the three for which I found</p>
<p>the most convincing evidence</p>
<p>and the largest bulk of evidence.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in exploring those,</p>
<p>proceed with caution, but they do seem quite interesting.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;ve reviewed a large amount of information</p>
<p>about the biology of pathways in the brain and body</p>
<p>that underlie the fear response</p>
<p>and that give rise to chronic fear</p>
<p>and in some cases to trauma and PTSD.</p>
<p>We also touched on a large variety of approaches</p>
<p>to dealing with fear, trauma, and PTSD</p>
<p>that currently exist in the clinical landscape out there.</p>
<p>I also touched on some of the emerging themes.</p>
<p>For instance, this short five minute a day</p>
<p>deliberate self-directed stress of any kind</p>
<p>through respiration or other approaches</p>
<p>of increasing adrenaline as an approach</p>
<p>that might be viable.</p>
<p>I should emphasize might be viable</p>
<p>for enhancing the speed or the potency of treatments</p>
<p>to reduce fear or eliminate trauma.</p>
<p>Most important I believe is to understand</p>
<p>and really think about the logical structure</p>
<p>of the circuits that underlie fear and PTSD.</p>
<p>Because in doing that, each of us,</p>
<p>all of us can think about what sorts of treatments</p>
<p>and approaches make the most sense for them.</p>
<p>I also hope that it will help people lean</p>
<p>into certain practices involving re-exposure</p>
<p>provided that&rsquo;s done in a supportive environment,</p>
<p>re-exposure to a given traumatic event</p>
<p>in an attempt to extinguish that.</p>
<p>Obviously you want to do that safely,</p>
<p>meaning psychologically safely and physically safely.</p>
<p>There are great practitioners out there</p>
<p>that can help you with that work.</p>
<p>There are also a number of people out there,</p>
<p>I am certain that are carrying certain traumas</p>
<p>or certain fears that they would like to alleviate</p>
<p>that are not in the extreme clinical realm.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why I touched on a number of things,</p>
<p>including some self-directed practices</p>
<p>that might be useful and reasonable for them to explore.</p>
<p>I realize we covered a lot of information today.</p>
