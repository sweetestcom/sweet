    <p>I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters</p>
<p>and he was slowly moving around</p>
<p>and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.</p>
<p>It was all still keyboard.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even have mice set up at that time,</p>
<p>but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.</p>
<p>The wall disappears in a little animation</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a monster like right there.</p>
<p>And he practically fell out of his chair.</p>
<p>It was just like, ah, and games just didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You know, the games were the God&rsquo;s eye view.</p>
<p>You were a little invested in your little guy.</p>
<p>You can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen,</p>
<p>but you just did not get that kind of startled reaction.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t inside the game.</p>
<p>Something in the back of your brain,</p>
<p>some reptile brain thing is just going,</p>
<p>oh shit, something just happened.</p>
<p>And that was one of those early points where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yeah, this is going to make a difference.</p>
<p>This is going to be powerful and it&rsquo;s going to matter.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with John Carmack,</p>
<p>widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>He was the cofounder of id Software</p>
<p>and the lead programmer on several games</p>
<p>that revolutionized the technology, the experience,</p>
<p>and the role of gaming in our society,</p>
<p>including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake.</p>
<p>He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR,</p>
<p>helping to create portals into virtual worlds</p>
<p>and to define the technological path</p>
<p>to the metaverse and meta.</p>
<p>And now he has been shifting some of his attention</p>
<p>to the problem of artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>This was the longest conversation on this podcast</p>
<p>at over five hours.</p>
<p>And still, I could talk to John many, many more times,</p>
<p>and we hope to do just that.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Readman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s John Carmack.</p>
<p>What was the first program you&rsquo;ve ever written?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>So I remember being in a radio shack</p>
<p>going up to the TRS 80 computers</p>
<p>and learning just enough to be able to do</p>
<p>10 print John Carmack.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of interesting how, of course,</p>
<p>Carnegie and Ritchie kind of standardized Hello World</p>
<p>as the first thing that you do</p>
<p>in every computer programming language in every computer,</p>
<p>but not having any interaction</p>
<p>with the cultures of Unix or any other standardized things.</p>
<p>It was just like, well, what am I gonna say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say my name.</p>
<p>And then you learn how to do go to 10</p>
<p>and have it scroll all off the screen.</p>
<p>And that was definitely the first thing</p>
<p>that I wound up doing on a computer.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a programming advice?</p>
<p>I was always told in the beginning</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not allowed to use go to statements.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really bad programming.</p>
<p>Is this correct or not?</p>
<p>Jumping around code, can we look at the philosophy</p>
<p>and the technical aspects of the go to statement</p>
<p>that seems so convenient,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s supposed to be bad programming?</p>
<p>Well, so certainly back in the day</p>
<p>in basic programming languages,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have proper loops.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have four whiles and repeats.</p>
<p>That was the land of Pascal for people</p>
<p>that kind of generally had access to it back then.</p>
<p>So you had no choice but to use go tos.</p>
<p>And as you made what were big programs back then,</p>
<p>which were a thousand line basic program</p>
<p>is a really big program.</p>
<p>They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have good editors or code exploration tools.</p>
<p>So you would wind up fixing things in one place,</p>
<p>add a little patch.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s reasons why structured programming</p>
<p>generally helps understanding,</p>
<p>but go tos aren&rsquo;t poisonous.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a language feature missing</p>
<p>like nested breaks or something</p>
<p>where it can sometimes be better to do a go to cleanup</p>
<p>or go to error rather than having multiple flags,</p>
<p>multiple if statements littered throughout things.</p>
<p>But it is rare.</p>
<p>I mean, if you gripped through all of my code right now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of my current code bases</p>
<p>would actually have a go to,</p>
<p>but deep within sort of the technical underpinnings</p>
<p>of a major game engine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have some go tos in a couple of places probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, the infrastructure on top of,</p>
<p>like the closer you get to machine code,</p>
<p>the more go tos you&rsquo;re gonna see,</p>
<p>the more of these like hacks you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>because the set of features available to you</p>
<p>in low level programming languages is not, is limited.</p>
<p>So print John Carmack,</p>
<p>when is the first time,</p>
<p>if we could talk about love,</p>
<p>that you fell in love with programming?</p>
<p>You said like, this is really something special.</p>
<p>It really was something</p>
<p>that was one of those love at first sight things</p>
<p>where just really from the time</p>
<p>that I understood what a computer was even,</p>
<p>I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias</p>
<p>of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes</p>
<p>at the reel to reel tape decks.</p>
<p>And for people nowadays,</p>
<p>it can be a little hard to understand</p>
<p>what the world was like then from information gathering</p>
<p>where I would go to the libraries</p>
<p>and there would be a couple books on the shelf</p>
<p>about computers and they would be very out of date</p>
<p>even at that point, just not a lot of information,</p>
<p>but I would grab everything that I could find</p>
<p>and devour everything.</p>
<p>Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers,</p>
<p>I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.</p>
<p>It just, it felt like this magical thing to me,</p>
<p>this idea that the computer would just do exactly</p>
<p>what you told it to.</p>
<p>I mean, and there&rsquo;s a little bit of the genie monkey&rsquo;s paw</p>
<p>sort of issues there where you&rsquo;d better be really,</p>
<p>really careful with what you&rsquo;re telling it to do,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t gonna back talk you.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t gonna have a different point of view.</p>
<p>It was gonna carry out what you told it to do.</p>
<p>And if you had the right commands,</p>
<p>you could make it do these pretty magical things.</p>
<p>And so what kind of programs did you write at first?</p>
<p>So beyond the print, John Carmack.</p>
<p>So I can remember as going through the learning process</p>
<p>where you find at the start,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just learning how to do</p>
<p>the most basic possible things.</p>
<p>And I can remember stuff like a Superman comic</p>
<p>that RadioShack commissioned to have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Superman had lost some of his super brain</p>
<p>and kids had to use RadioShack TRS 80 computers</p>
<p>to do calculations for it to help him</p>
<p>kind of complete his heroics.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d find little things like that</p>
<p>and then get a few basic books</p>
<p>to be able to kind of work my way up.</p>
<p>And again, it was so precious back then.</p>
<p>I had a couple of books</p>
<p>that would teach me important things about it.</p>
<p>I had one book that I could start to learn</p>
<p>a little bit of assembly language from,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d have a few books on basic</p>
<p>and some things that I could get from the libraries.</p>
<p>But my goals in the early days</p>
<p>was almost always making games of various kinds.</p>
<p>I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games.</p>
<p>And being able to do some of those things myself</p>
<p>on the computers was very much what I aspired to.</p>
<p>And it was a whole journey where</p>
<p>if you learn normal basic,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do any kind of an action game.</p>
<p>You can write an adventure game.</p>
<p>You can write things where you say, what do you do here?</p>
<p>I get sword attack troll, that type of thing.</p>
<p>And that can be done in the context of basic.</p>
<p>But to do things that had moving graphics,</p>
<p>there were only the most limited things</p>
<p>you could possibly do.</p>
<p>You could maybe do breakout or pong</p>
<p>or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics.</p>
<p>And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks</p>
<p>that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers,</p>
<p>they had a mode called low resolution graphics</p>
<p>where of course all graphics were low resolution back then,</p>
<p>but regular low resolution graphics,</p>
<p>it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally,</p>
<p>but they could have 16 different colors.</p>
<p>And I wanted to make a game kind of like</p>
<p>the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game.</p>
<p>And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up.</p>
<p>And I could move a little ship around.</p>
<p>You could manage to do that in basic,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way you could redraw the whole screen.</p>
<p>And I remember at the time just coming up</p>
<p>with what felt like a brainstorm to me</p>
<p>where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled</p>
<p>where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen</p>
<p>were basically the same thing.</p>
<p>And all those computers could scroll their text screen</p>
<p>reasonably.</p>
<p>You could do a listing and it would scroll things up.</p>
<p>And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple</p>
<p>things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode</p>
<p>and I could draw graphics and then I could just</p>
<p>do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>And then the system would scroll it all up</p>
<p>using an assembly language routine</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t know how to write back then.</p>
<p>So that was like this first great hack</p>
<p>that sort of had analogs later on in my career</p>
<p>for a lot of different things.</p>
<p>So I found out that I could draw a screen.</p>
<p>I could do a line feed at the bottom.</p>
<p>It would scroll it up once.</p>
<p>I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.</p>
<p>And that was my first way to kind of scroll</p>
<p>the screen, which was interesting in that that played</p>
<p>a big part later on in the id Software days as well.</p>
<p>So do efficient drawing where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to draw the whole screen,</p>
<p>but you draw from the bottom using</p>
<p>the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where so much of, until recently,</p>
<p>game design was limited by what you could actually</p>
<p>get the computer to do.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s easy to say, OK, I want to scroll the screen.</p>
<p>You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.</p>
<p>And nowadays, that works just fine.</p>
<p>Computers are ludicrously fast.</p>
<p>But up until a decade ago or so, there</p>
<p>were all these things everybody wanted to do.</p>
<p>But if they knew enough programming</p>
<p>to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow</p>
<p>to be a good experience.</p>
<p>Either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t fun to experience it like that.</p>
<p>So much of the first couple of decades of the programming work</p>
<p>that I did was largely figuring out</p>
<p>how to do something that everybody</p>
<p>knows how they want it to happen.</p>
<p>It just has to happen 2 to 10 times faster</p>
<p>than the straightforward way of doing things</p>
<p>would make it happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s different now because at this point, lots of things</p>
<p>you can just do in the most naive possible way,</p>
<p>and it still works out.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have nearly the creative limitations</p>
<p>or the incentives for optimizing on that level.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of pros and cons to that.</p>
<p>But I do generally, I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit</p>
<p>where back in my day, programmers</p>
<p>had to do real programming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that you can just pick an idea</p>
<p>and go do it right now.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to be some assembly language wizard</p>
<p>or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out</p>
<p>how to make your wishes happen.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s still, see, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But let me put on my old man with a fist hat</p>
<p>and say that probably the thing that will define the future</p>
<p>still requires you to operate at the limits</p>
<p>of the current system.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll probably talk about this.</p>
<p>But if you talk about building the metaverse</p>
<p>and building a VR experience that&rsquo;s compelling,</p>
<p>it probably requires you to not, to go to assembly</p>
<p>or maybe not literally, but sort of spiritually</p>
<p>to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.</p>
<p>And that really was why virtual reality</p>
<p>was specifically interesting to me</p>
<p>where it had all the ties to,</p>
<p>you could say that even back in the early days,</p>
<p>I have some old magazine articles</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s talking about Doom as a virtual reality experience</p>
<p>back when just seeing anything in 3D.</p>
<p>So you could say that we&rsquo;ve been trying to build</p>
<p>those virtual experiences from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And in the modern era of virtual reality,</p>
<p>especially on the mobile side of things,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s standalone and you&rsquo;re basically using</p>
<p>a cell phone chip to be able to produce</p>
<p>these very immersive experiences,</p>
<p>it does require work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at the level of what an old school</p>
<p>console game programmer would have operated at</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re looking at hardware registers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re scheduling all the DMA accesses,</p>
<p>but it is still definitely a different level</p>
<p>than what a web developer or even a PC Steam game developer</p>
<p>usually has to work at.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s opportunities for people that wanna operate</p>
<p>at either end of that spectrum there</p>
<p>and still provide a lot of value to the world.</p>
<p>Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.</p>
<p>What would you say is the best programming language?</p>
<p>Your favorite, but also the best.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen throughout your career,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re considered by many to be</p>
<p>the greatest programmer ever.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so difficult to place that label on anyone,</p>
<p>but if you put it on anyone, it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s the best band of all time,</p>
<p>but in your case, what&rsquo;s the best programming language?</p>
<p>Everything has all the caveats about it.</p>
<p>But so what I use, so nowadays I do program</p>
<p>a reasonable amount of Python for AI, ML sorts of work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a native Python programmer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I came to very late in my career.</p>
<p>I understand what it&rsquo;s good for.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t dream in Python.</p>
<p>I do not.</p>
<p>And it has some of those things</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some amazing stats when you say,</p>
<p>if you just start, if you make a loop,</p>
<p>a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,</p>
<p>you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower</p>
<p>than a proper GPU tensor operation.</p>
<p>And these are staggering numbers.</p>
<p>You can be as much slower as we&rsquo;ve almost gotten faster</p>
<p>in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff.</p>
<p>So your intuitions about inefficiencies</p>
<p>within the Python sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>It keeps hitting me upside the face</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gotten to the point now I understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, you just can&rsquo;t do a loop</p>
<p>if you care about performance in Python.</p>
<p>You have to figure out how you can reformat this</p>
<p>into some big vector operation</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s going to be done completely</p>
<p>within a C++ library.</p>
<p>But the other hand is it&rsquo;s amazingly convenient</p>
<p>and you just see stuff that people are able</p>
<p>to cobble together by you just import</p>
<p>a few different things and you can do stuff</p>
<p>that nobody on earth could do 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And you can do it in a little cookbook thing</p>
<p>that you copy paste it out of a website.</p>
<p>So that is really great.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m sitting down to do what I consider</p>
<p>kind of serious programming, it&rsquo;s still in C++.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really kind of a C flavored C++ at that</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not big into the modern template</p>
<p>metaprogramming sorts of things.</p>
<p>I see a lot of train wrecks coming from</p>
<p>some of that over abstraction.</p>
<p>I spent a few years really going kind of deep</p>
<p>into the kind of the historical Lisp work</p>
<p>and Haskell and some of the functional programming</p>
<p>sides of things.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of value there</p>
<p>in the way you think about things.</p>
<p>And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code</p>
<p>based on what I learned about the value</p>
<p>that comes out of not having this random mutable state</p>
<p>that you kind of lose track of.</p>
<p>Because something that many people don&rsquo;t really appreciate</p>
<p>till they&rsquo;ve been at it for a long time</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not the writing of the program initially,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the whole lifespan of the program.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s not necessarily just</p>
<p>how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s how can it bend and adapt</p>
<p>as situations change.</p>
<p>And then the thing that I&rsquo;ve really been learning</p>
<p>in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s also how well it hands off</p>
<p>between the continuous kind of revolving door of programmers</p>
<p>taking over maintenance and different things</p>
<p>and how you get people up to speed in different areas.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these other different aspects of it.</p>
<p>So C++ is a good language for handover between engineers.</p>
<p>Probably not the best.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some really interesting aspects to this</p>
<p>where in some cases languages</p>
<p>that are not generally thought well of for many reasons,</p>
<p>like C is derided pretty broadly that yes,</p>
<p>obviously all of these security flaws</p>
<p>that happen with the memory and unsafeness</p>
<p>and buffer overruns and the things that you&rsquo;ve got there,</p>
<p>but there is this underappreciated aspect</p>
<p>to the language is so simple, anyone can go.</p>
<p>And if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace</p>
<p>and not have to learn what paradigms they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>because there just aren&rsquo;t that many available.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some really, really well written C code.</p>
<p>Like I find it great that if I&rsquo;m messing around</p>
<p>with something in open BSD say,</p>
<p>I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I understand everything that&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard for me to figure out what I need to do</p>
<p>to make whatever change that I need to</p>
<p>while you can have more significant languages.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a downside of Lisp</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t regret the time that I spent with Lisp.</p>
<p>I think that it did help my thinking</p>
<p>about programming in some ways,</p>
<p>but the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp</p>
<p>are saying how malleable of a language it is</p>
<p>that if you write a huge Lisp program,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve basically invented your own kind of language</p>
<p>and structure because it&rsquo;s not the primitives</p>
<p>of the language you&rsquo;re using very much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of the things you&rsquo;ve built on top of that.</p>
<p>And then a language like Racket,</p>
<p>kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essentially touted as a language</p>
<p>for building other languages.</p>
<p>And I understand the value of that</p>
<p>for a tiny little project,</p>
<p>but the idea of that for one of these longterm</p>
<p>supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me</p>
<p>where all of those abstractions that you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, you can&rsquo;t touch this code till you educate yourself</p>
<p>on all of these things that we&rsquo;ve built on top of that.</p>
<p>And it was interesting to see how when Google made Go,</p>
<p>a lot of the criticisms of that are it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>wow, this is not a state of the art language.</p>
<p>This language is just so simple and almost crude.</p>
<p>And you could see the programming language people</p>
<p>just looking down at it.</p>
<p>But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying,</p>
<p>this is the good things about C,</p>
<p>everybody can just jump right in and use it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to restructure your brain</p>
<p>to write good code in it.</p>
<p>So I wish that I had more opportunity</p>
<p>for doing some work in Go.</p>
<p>Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not fit to pass judgment on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a little bit beyond Hello World.</p>
<p>I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust</p>
<p>just as an exercise, but that was a few years ago</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t really used it since.</p>
<p>The best programming language is the one that works generally</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re currently using.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s another trap is in almost every case</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen when people mixed languages on a project,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>I would rather stay just in one language</p>
<p>so that everybody can work across the entire thing.</p>
<p>And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects</p>
<p>that use kind of React frameworks.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got JavaScript here</p>
<p>and then you have C++ for real work.</p>
<p>And then you may have Java interfacing</p>
<p>with some other part of the Android system.</p>
<p>And those are all kind of horrible things.</p>
<p>And that was one thing that I remember talking</p>
<p>with Boz at Facebook about it where like,</p>
<p>man, I wish we could have just said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only hiring C++ programmers.</p>
<p>And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective,</p>
<p>well, we just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find enough.</p>
<p>With the thousands of programmers they&rsquo;ve got there,</p>
<p>it is not necessarily a dying breed,</p>
<p>but you can sure find a lot more Java</p>
<p>or JavaScript programmers.</p>
<p>And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time</p>
<p>and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, you just,</p>
<p>you go out and you find those programmers</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t hire the other programmers</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t do the languages that you wanna use.</p>
<p>But right now, I guess, yeah,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work</p>
<p>for the UI side of things.</p>
<p>When you go find UI programmers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re JavaScript programmers.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of JavaScript programmers.</p>
<p>Because I do think that great programmers are rare.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s not, you know, if you just look at statistics</p>
<p>of how many people are using different programming languages,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t tell you the story</p>
<p>of what the great programmers are using.</p>
<p>And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to,</p>
<p>which is the fundamentals of a language.</p>
<p>What does it encourage?</p>
<p>How does it encourage you to think?</p>
<p>What kind of systems does it encourage you to build?</p>
<p>There is something about C++</p>
<p>that has elements of creativity,</p>
<p>but forces you to be an adult about your programming.</p>
<p>It expects you to be an adult.</p>
<p>It does not force you to.</p>
<p>And so it brings out people that are willing to be creative</p>
<p>in terms of building large systems</p>
<p>and coming up with interesting solutions,</p>
<p>but at the same time have the sort of the good</p>
<p>software engineering practices that amend themselves</p>
<p>to real world systems.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.</p>
<p>So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years,</p>
<p>and humans are long gone, something tells me</p>
<p>that most of the systems they find will be run by humans.</p>
<p>Will be running JavaScript.</p>
<p>I kind of think that if we&rsquo;re living in a simulation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s written in JavaScript.</p>
<p>You know, for the longest time, even still,</p>
<p>JavaScript didn&rsquo;t get any respect,</p>
<p>and yet it runs so much of the world,</p>
<p>and an increasing number of the world.</p>
<p>Is it possible that everything will be written</p>
<p>in JavaScript one day?</p>
<p>So the engineering under JavaScript</p>
<p>is really pretty phenomenal.</p>
<p>The systems that make JavaScript run as fast</p>
<p>as it does right now are kind of miracles</p>
<p>of modern engineering in many ways.</p>
<p>It does feel like it is not an optimal language</p>
<p>for all the things that it&rsquo;s being used for,</p>
<p>or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps</p>
<p>in something like this without type systems and so on.</p>
<p>But I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>it does reasonably the necessary things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a C flavored language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a braces and semicolon language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript</p>
<p>and then understand the roots of where it came from.</p>
<p>I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing</p>
<p>for most programs to be written in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that I still, just this morning,</p>
<p>I was seeing a Twitter thread</p>
<p>of a bunch of really senior game dev people</p>
<p>arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.</p>
<p>You will run into some people that are top notch programmers</p>
<p>that just say, no, this is literally not a good thing.</p>
<p>Oh, because it makes you lazy?</p>
<p>Yes, that it makes you not think about things.</p>
<p>And I do disagree.</p>
<p>I think that there is so much objective data</p>
<p>on the vulnerabilities that have happened</p>
<p>in C and C++ programs,</p>
<p>sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nobody is good enough to avoid</p>
<p>ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.</p>
<p>You write enough C code,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
<p>And garbage collection is a very great thing</p>
<p>for the vast majority of programs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when you get into the tightest of real time things</p>
<p>that you start saying, it&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>the garbage collection has more costs</p>
<p>than it has benefits for me there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not 99 plus percent</p>
<p>of all the software in the world.</p>
<p>So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.</p>
<p>And so much of programming is not the language itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the infrastructure around that surrounds it.</p>
<p>All the libraries that you can get</p>
<p>and the different stuff that you can,</p>
<p>ways you can deploy it,</p>
<p>the portability that it gives you.</p>
<p>And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things</p>
<p>where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it,</p>
<p>the web stack about everything that has to go</p>
<p>when you do something really trivial in JavaScript</p>
<p>and it shows up on a web browser</p>
<p>to kind of X ray through that</p>
<p>and see everything that has to happen</p>
<p>for your one little JavaScript statement</p>
<p>to turn into something visible in your web browser,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very disquieting,</p>
<p>just the depth of that stack</p>
<p>and the fact that so few people can even comprehend</p>
<p>all of the levels that are going on there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s again, I have to caution myself</p>
<p>to not be the in the good old days old man about it</p>
<p>because clearly there&rsquo;s enormous value here.</p>
<p>The world does run on JavaScript</p>
<p>to a pretty good approximation there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not falling apart.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of scary stuff</p>
<p>where you look at console logs</p>
<p>and you just see all of these bad things that are happening</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still kind of limping along</p>
<p>and nobody really notices.</p>
<p>But so much of my systems design</p>
<p>and systems analysis goes around.</p>
<p>You should understand what the speed of light is,</p>
<p>like what would be the best you could possibly do here.</p>
<p>And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases,</p>
<p>you can be a thousand times off your speed of light,</p>
<p>velocity for something and it&rsquo;s still be okay.</p>
<p>And in fact, it can even sometimes still be</p>
<p>the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t wanna have to parachute in someone like me</p>
<p>to go in and say, make this webpage run</p>
<p>a thousand times faster,</p>
<p>make this web app into a hardcore native application</p>
<p>that starts up in 37 milliseconds</p>
<p>and everything responds in less than one frame latency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not necessary.</p>
<p>And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars</p>
<p>to do software like that,</p>
<p>when they can take somebody right out of a bootcamp</p>
<p>and say, spin up an application for this.</p>
<p>Often being efficient is not really the best metric.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that applies in a lot of areas</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s kind of interesting how a lot of our appliances</p>
<p>and everything are all built around energy efficiency,</p>
<p>sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways</p>
<p>or higher costs in other ways</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s interesting things</p>
<p>where energy or electricity could become much cheaper</p>
<p>in a future world.</p>
<p>And that could change our engineering trade offs</p>
<p>for the way we build certain things</p>
<p>where you could throw away efficiency</p>
<p>and actually get more benefits that actually matter.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the directions</p>
<p>I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy.</p>
<p>When I was kind of like, what do I wanna do next?</p>
<p>It was either gonna be cost effective nuclear fission</p>
<p>or artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>And one of my pet ideas there is like,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t understand how cheap nuclear fuel is.</p>
<p>And there would be ways that,</p>
<p>you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less,</p>
<p>but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper,</p>
<p>that could be a radical innovation in something like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like some of these thoughts</p>
<p>around like direct fission energy conversion,</p>
<p>fission fragment conversion,</p>
<p>that maybe you build something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require all the steam turbines and everything,</p>
<p>even if it winds up being less efficient.</p>
<p>So that applies a lot in programming</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s always good to know what you could do.</p>
<p>If you really sat down and took it far,</p>
<p>because sometimes there&rsquo;s discontinuities</p>
<p>like around user reaction times,</p>
<p>there are some points where the difference between</p>
<p>operating in one second and 750 milliseconds,</p>
<p>not that huge.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see it in webpage statistics,</p>
<p>but most of the usability stuff, not that great.</p>
<p>But if you get down to 50 milliseconds,</p>
<p>then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like doing your bidding instantly</p>
<p>rather than you&rsquo;re giving it a command,</p>
<p>twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.</p>
<p>So sometimes it&rsquo;s important to really crunch hard</p>
<p>to get over some threshold,</p>
<p>but there are broad basins in the value metric</p>
<p>for lots of work where it just doesn&rsquo;t pay</p>
<p>to even go that extra mile.</p>
<p>And there are craftsmen that just don&rsquo;t wanna buy that</p>
<p>and more power to them.</p>
<p>If somebody just wants to say,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m going to be, my pride is in my work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never going to do something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not as good as I could possibly make it,</p>
<p>I respect that and sometimes I am that person,</p>
<p>but I try to focus more on the larger value picture</p>
<p>and you do pick your battles</p>
<p>and you deploy your resources in the play</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to give you the best user value in the end.</p>
<p>Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth</p>
<p>as a kind of programming effort,</p>
<p>it seems like efficiency isn&rsquo;t the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being optimized for.</p>
<p>Like natural selection is very inefficient,</p>
<p>but it kind of adapts and through the process</p>
<p>of adaptations building more and more complex systems</p>
<p>that are more and more intelligent,</p>
<p>the final result is kind of pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And so I think of JavaScript the same way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this giant mess</p>
<p>that things naturally die off if they don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and if they become useful to people,</p>
<p>they kind of naturally live</p>
<p>and then you build this community,</p>
<p>large community of people that are generating code</p>
<p>and some code is sticky, some is not</p>
<p>and nobody knows the inefficiencies or the efficiencies</p>
<p>or the breaking points, like how reliable this code is</p>
<p>and you kind of just run it, assume it works</p>
<p>and then get unpleasantly surprised</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s very kind of the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really good analogy</p>
<p>and we can go a lot of places with that</p>
<p>where in the earliest days of programming,</p>
<p>when you had finite, you could count the bytes</p>
<p>that you had to work on this,</p>
<p>you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf</p>
<p>to be one less instruction</p>
<p>than the other person&rsquo;s multiply routine</p>
<p>to kind of get through and it was so perfectly crafted.</p>
<p>It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program</p>
<p>because there just were not that many,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t afford to be lazy in different ways</p>
<p>and in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work</p>
<p>where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re gonna do billions and billions</p>
<p>of programmable weights here,</p>
<p>you have to turn it down into something</p>
<p>that is symbolic and crafted like that</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s definitely not the way DNA and life</p>
<p>and biological evolution and things work.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s almost humbling</p>
<p>how little programming code is in our bodies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a couple of billion base pairs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like this all fits on a thumb drive for years now</p>
<p>and then our brains are even a smaller section of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got maybe 50 megabytes</p>
<p>and this is not like Shannon Limit perfectly</p>
<p>information dense conveyances here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these are messy codes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re broken up into amino acids.</p>
<p>A lot of them don&rsquo;t do important things</p>
<p>or they do things in very awkward ways</p>
<p>but it is this process of just accumulation</p>
<p>on top of things and you need scale,</p>
<p>both you need scale for the population for that to work out</p>
<p>and in the early days in the 50s and 60s,</p>
<p>the kind of ancient era of computers</p>
<p>where you could count when they say like</p>
<p>when the internet started even in the 70s,</p>
<p>there were like 18 hosts or something on it.</p>
<p>It was this small finite number</p>
<p>and you were still optimizing everything</p>
<p>to be as good as you possibly could be</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s billions and billions of devices</p>
<p>and everything going on and you can have</p>
<p>this very much natural evolution going on</p>
<p>where lots of things are tried,</p>
<p>lots of things are blowing up,</p>
<p>venture capitalists lose their money</p>
<p>when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack</p>
<p>and things completely failed or failed the scale</p>
<p>but good things do come out of it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting to see the mimetic evolution</p>
<p>of the way different things happen</p>
<p>like mentioning hello world at the beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how some little thing like that</p>
<p>where everybody, every programmer knows hello world now</p>
<p>and that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision</p>
<p>that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C</p>
<p>and early examples of things like that.</p>
<p>So millions of experiments are going on all the time</p>
<p>but some things do kind of rise to the top</p>
<p>and win the fitness war for whether it&rsquo;s mind space</p>
<p>or programming techniques or anything.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a site on Stack Exchange called CodeGolf</p>
<p>where people compete to write the shortest possible program</p>
<p>for a particular task in all the different kinds</p>
<p>of languages and it&rsquo;s really interesting to see</p>
<p>folks kind of, they&rsquo;re masters of their craft,</p>
<p>really play with the limits of programming languages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really beautiful to see</p>
<p>and across all the different programming languages,</p>
<p>you get to see some of these weird programming languages</p>
<p>and mainstream ones, difference between Python 2 and 3,</p>
<p>you get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java</p>
<p>and you get to see JavaScript, all of that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of inspiring to see how much depth</p>
<p>of possibility there is within programming languages</p>
<p>that CodeGolf kind of tasks reveal.</p>
<p>Most of us, if you do any kind of programming,</p>
<p>you kind of do boring kind of very vanilla type of code.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to build large systems</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nice to see that the possibility</p>
<p>of creative genius is still within those languages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s laden within those languages.</p>
<p>So given that you are once again,</p>
<p>one of the greatest programmers ever,</p>
<p>what do you think makes a good programmer?</p>
<p>Maybe a good modern programmer.</p>
<p>So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta</p>
<p>to the TPM organization and my biggest point was</p>
<p>everything that we&rsquo;re doing really should flow</p>
<p>from user value, all the good things that we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re not technical people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you shouldn&rsquo;t be taking pride</p>
<p>just in the specific thing.</p>
<p>Like CodeGolf is the sort of thing, it&rsquo;s a fun puzzle game</p>
<p>but that really should not be a major motivator for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re solving problems for people</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re providing entertainment to people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing something of value to people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s displacing something else in their life.</p>
<p>So we wanna be providing a net value</p>
<p>over what they could be doing</p>
<p>but instead they&rsquo;re choosing to use our products.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where, I mean, it sounds trite or corny</p>
<p>but I fundamentally do think that&rsquo;s how you make</p>
<p>the world a better place.</p>
<p>If you have given more value to people</p>
<p>than it took you and your team to create,</p>
<p>then the world&rsquo;s a better place.</p>
<p>People have, they&rsquo;ve gone from something of lesser value,</p>
<p>chosen to use your product</p>
<p>and their life feels better for that.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve produced that economically,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just kind of shoveled a lot of cash</p>
<p>into a wood chipper there</p>
<p>and you should maybe not feel so good</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So being proud about like a specific architecture</p>
<p>or a specific technology or a specific code sequence</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s great to get a little smile</p>
<p>like a tiny little dopamine hit for that</p>
<p>but the top level metrics should be</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re building things of value.</p>
<p>Now you can get into the argument about how you,</p>
<p>what is user value?</p>
<p>How do you actually quantify that?</p>
<p>And there can be big arguments about that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s easy to be able to say,</p>
<p>okay, this pissed off user there is not getting value</p>
<p>from what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This user over there with the big smile on their face,</p>
<p>the moment of delight when something happened,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a value that&rsquo;s happened there.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to at least accept</p>
<p>that there is a concept of user value</p>
<p>even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it,</p>
<p>you can usually make relative arguments about it.</p>
<p>Well, this was better than this, we&rsquo;ve improved things.</p>
<p>So being a servant to the user is your job</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a developer, you wanna be producing something</p>
<p>that other people are gonna find valuable.</p>
<p>And if you are technically inclined</p>
<p>then finding the right levers to be able to pull</p>
<p>to be able to make a design that&rsquo;s going to produce</p>
<p>the most value for the least amount of effort.</p>
<p>And it always has to be kind of divided,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ratio there where you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem at the big tech companies,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Meta Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,</p>
<p>companies that have almost infinite money.</p>
<p>I mean, I know their CFO will complain</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not infinite money</p>
<p>but from most developers standpoints</p>
<p>it really does feel like it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost counterintuitive</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re working hard as a developer on something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always this thought,</p>
<p>if only I had more resources, more people, more RAM,</p>
<p>more megahertz, then my product will be better.</p>
<p>And that sense that at certain points, it&rsquo;s certainly true</p>
<p>that if you are really hamstrung by this,</p>
<p>removing an obstacle will make a better product,</p>
<p>make more value.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not making your core design decisions</p>
<p>in this fiercely competitive way</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re saying feature A or feature B,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just say, let&rsquo;s do both.</p>
<p>Because then you&rsquo;re not making a value judgment about them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just saying, well, they both seem good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna necessarily have to pick out</p>
<p>which one is better or how much better</p>
<p>and tell team B that, sorry, we&rsquo;re not gonna do this</p>
<p>because A is more important.</p>
<p>But that notion of always having to really critically value</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, your time, the resources you expend,</p>
<p>even the opportunity cost of doing something else,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about the big debates</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re mentioning of how to measure value.</p>
<p>Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically</p>
<p>or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive,</p>
<p>the designer route of imagining</p>
<p>sort of somebody using a thing</p>
<p>and imagining a smile on their face,</p>
<p>imagining the experience of love and joy</p>
<p>that you have when you use the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from a design perspective</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re building more like a lower level thing</p>
<p>for like Linux, you imagine a developer</p>
<p>that might come across this and use it</p>
<p>and become happy and better off because of it.</p>
<p>So where do you land on those things?</p>
<p>Is it measurable?</p>
<p>So I imagine like Meta and Google</p>
<p>will probably try to measure the thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll try to, it&rsquo;s like you try to optimize engagement</p>
<p>or something, let&rsquo;s measure engagement.</p>
<p>And then I think there is a kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, I admire the designer ethic of like,</p>
<p>think of a future that&rsquo;s immeasurable</p>
<p>and you try to make somebody in that future</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different from today happy.</p>
<p>So I do usually favor,</p>
<p>if you can get any kind of a metric that&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>by all means, listen to the data.</p>
<p>But you can go too far there where we&rsquo;ve had problems</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, hey, we had a performance regression</p>
<p>because our fancy new telemetry system</p>
<p>is doing a bazillion file writes</p>
<p>to kind of archive this stuff</p>
<p>because we needed to collect information</p>
<p>to determine if we were doing,</p>
<p>if our plans were good.</p>
<p>So when information is available,</p>
<p>you should never ignore it.</p>
<p>I mean, all of it.</p>
<p>For actual users using the thing,</p>
<p>human beings using the thing,</p>
<p>large number of human beings,</p>
<p>and you get to see sort of a lot of large numbers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the zero to one problem</p>
<p>of when you&rsquo;re doing something really new,</p>
<p>you do kind of have to make a guess.</p>
<p>But one of the points that I&rsquo;ve been making at Meta</p>
<p>is we have more than enough users now</p>
<p>that anything somebody wants to try in VR,</p>
<p>we have users that will be interested in that.</p>
<p>You do not get to make a completely</p>
<p>greenfield blue sky pitch and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do this because I think it might be interesting.</p>
<p>I challenge everyone.</p>
<p>There are going to be people,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s working in VR on your,</p>
<p>like on your desktop replacement</p>
<p>or communicating with people in different ways</p>
<p>or playing the games.</p>
<p>There are going to be probably millions of people,</p>
<p>or at least if you pick some tiny niche</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not in right now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still going to be thousands of people out there</p>
<p>that have the headsets that would be your target market.</p>
<p>And I tell people, pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t invent fictional users.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make an Alice Bob Charlie</p>
<p>that fits whatever matrix of tendencies</p>
<p>that you want to break the market down to,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a mistake to think about imaginary users</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve got real users that you could be working with.</p>
<p>But on the other hand,</p>
<p>there is value to having a kind of wholeness</p>
<p>of vision for a product.</p>
<p>And companies like Meta have,</p>
<p>they understand the trade offs where you can have a company</p>
<p>like SpaceX or Apple in the Steve Jobs era,</p>
<p>where you have a very powerful leading personality</p>
<p>that can micromanage at a very low level</p>
<p>and can say it&rsquo;s like, no, that handle needs to be different</p>
<p>or that icon needs to change the tint there.</p>
<p>And they clearly get a lot of value out of it.</p>
<p>They also burn through a lot of employees</p>
<p>that have horror stories to tell</p>
<p>about working there afterwards.</p>
<p>My position is that you&rsquo;re at your best</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve got a leader that is at their limit</p>
<p>of what they can kind of comprehend</p>
<p>of everything below them.</p>
<p>And they can have an informed opinion</p>
<p>about everything that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And you take somebody, you&rsquo;ve got to believe</p>
<p>that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience,</p>
<p>you would hope that they&rsquo;ve got wisdom</p>
<p>that the just out of bootcamp person contributing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And that if they&rsquo;re like, well, that&rsquo;s wrong there,</p>
<p>you probably shouldn&rsquo;t do it that way</p>
<p>or even just don&rsquo;t do it that way, do it another way.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s value there,</p>
<p>but it can&rsquo;t go beyond a certain level.</p>
<p>I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him saying things</p>
<p>that are just wrong right in front of me</p>
<p>about technical things because he was not operating</p>
<p>at that level.</p>
<p>But when it does work and you do get</p>
<p>that kind of passionate leader</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s thinking about the entire product</p>
<p>and just really deeply cares</p>
<p>about not letting anything slip through the cracks,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s got a lot of value.</p>
<p>But the other side of that is the people saying that,</p>
<p>well, we wanna have these independent teams</p>
<p>that are bubbling up the ideas</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s almost it&rsquo;s anti capitalist</p>
<p>or anti free market to say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I want my grand, my great leader</p>
<p>to go ahead and dictate all these points there</p>
<p>where clearly free markets bring up things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>Like in VR, we saw a bunch of things</p>
<p>like it didn&rsquo;t turn out at all</p>
<p>the way the early people thought</p>
<p>were gonna be the key applications</p>
<p>and things that would not have been approved</p>
<p>by the dark cabal making the decisions</p>
<p>about what gets into the store turn out</p>
<p>to in some cases be extremely successful.</p>
<p>So yeah, I definitely kind of wanted to be,</p>
<p>there was a point where I did make a pitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, make me VR dictator</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go in and get shit done.</p>
<p>I am, and that&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not in the culture at Meta.</p>
<p>You know, and they understand the trade offs they,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just not the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the company that they want,</p>
<p>the team that they wanna do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating because VR and we&rsquo;ll talk about it more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still unclear to me</p>
<p>in what way VR will change the world</p>
<p>because it does seem clear that VR</p>
<p>will somehow fundamentally transform this world</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unclear to me how yet.</p>
<p>Let me know when you wanna get into that.</p>
<p>Who will?</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>So in the stick to the you being the best programmer ever.</p>
<p>Okay, in the early days when you didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>when you didn&rsquo;t have adult responsibilities</p>
<p>of leading teams and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>and you can focus on just being a programmer,</p>
<p>what did the productive day in the life</p>
<p>of John Carmack look like?</p>
<p>How many hours is the keyboard?</p>
<p>How much sleep?</p>
<p>What was the source of calories that fueled the brain?</p>
<p>What was it like?</p>
<p>What times did you wake up?</p>
<p>So I was able to be remarkably consistent</p>
<p>about what was good working conditions for me</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>I was never one of the programmers</p>
<p>that would do all nighters going through work</p>
<p>for 20 hours straight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my brain generally starts turning to mush</p>
<p>after 12 hours or so.</p>
<p>But the hard work is really important</p>
<p>and I would work for decades.</p>
<p>I would work 60 hours a week.</p>
<p>I would work a 10 hour day, six days a week</p>
<p>and try to be productive at that.</p>
<p>Now my schedule shifted around a fair amount</p>
<p>when I was young without any kids</p>
<p>and any other responsibilities.</p>
<p>I was on one of those cycling schedules</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;d kind of get in an hour later each day</p>
<p>and roll around through the entire time</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d wind up kind of pulling in at two or three</p>
<p>in the afternoon sometimes and then working again</p>
<p>past midnight or two in the morning.</p>
<p>And that was, when it was just me trying</p>
<p>to make things happen and I was usually isolated off</p>
<p>in my office, people generally didn&rsquo;t bother me much at in</p>
<p>and I could get a lot of programming work done that way.</p>
<p>I did settle into a more normal schedule</p>
<p>when I was taking kids to school and things like that.</p>
<p>So kids were the forcing function that got you to wake up</p>
<p>at the same time each day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear to me that there was much of a difference</p>
<p>in the productivity with that where I kind of feel,</p>
<p>if I just get up when I feel like it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually a little later each day</p>
<p>but I just recently made the focusing decision</p>
<p>to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier</p>
<p>to getting up at eight in the morning</p>
<p>and trying to shift things around.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m often doing experiments with myself</p>
<p>about what should I be doing to be more productive</p>
<p>and one of the things that I did realize was happening</p>
<p>in recent months where I would go for a walk or a run.</p>
<p>I cover like four miles a day and I would usually do that</p>
<p>just as the sun&rsquo;s going down here in Texas now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still really damn hot but I&rsquo;d go out</p>
<p>at 8.30 or something and cover the time there</p>
<p>and then the showering and it was putting a hold in my day</p>
<p>where I would have still a couple hours after that</p>
<p>and sometimes my best hours were at night</p>
<p>when nobody else is around, nobody&rsquo;s bothering me</p>
<p>but that hole in the day was a problem</p>
<p>so just a couple weeks ago, I made the change</p>
<p>to go ahead and say, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get up a little earlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a walk or get out there first</p>
<p>so I can have more uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still playing with factors like this</p>
<p>as I kind of optimize my work efforts</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always been, it was 60 hours a week</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>To some degree, I had a little thing in the back of my head</p>
<p>where I was almost jealous of some of the programmers</p>
<p>that would do these marathon sessions</p>
<p>and I had like Dave Taylor, one of the guys that he had,</p>
<p>he would be one of those people</p>
<p>that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes</p>
<p>and all the kind of classic hacker tropes about things</p>
<p>and a part of me was like always a little bothered</p>
<p>that that wasn&rsquo;t me, that I wouldn&rsquo;t go program</p>
<p>20 hours straight because I&rsquo;m falling apart</p>
<p>and not being very effective after 12 hours.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, 12 hour programming,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine when you&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>but it never, you&rsquo;re not doing smart work much after,</p>
<p>at least I&rsquo;m not, but there&rsquo;s a range of people.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s something that a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really get in their gut</p>
<p>where there are people that work on four hours of sleep</p>
<p>and are smart and can continue to do good work</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a lot of people that just fall apart.</p>
<p>So I do tell people that I always try</p>
<p>to get eight hours of sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not this, you know, push yourself harder,</p>
<p>get up earlier, I just do worse work</p>
<p>where, you know, you can work a hundred hours a week</p>
<p>and still get eight hours of sleep</p>
<p>if you just kind of prioritize things correctly</p>
<p>but I do believe in working hard, working a lot.</p>
<p>There was a comment that a game dev made</p>
<p>that I know there&rsquo;s a backlash against really hard work</p>
<p>in a lot of cases and I get into online arguments</p>
<p>about this all the time but he was basically saying,</p>
<p>yeah, 40 hours a week, that&rsquo;s kind of a part time job</p>
<p>and if you were really in it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing what you think is important,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re passionate about, working more gets more done</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just really not possible to argue with that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been around the people</p>
<p>that work with that level of intensity</p>
<p>and just say, it&rsquo;s like, no, they should just stop.</p>
<p>And we had, I kind of came back around to that</p>
<p>a couple of years ago where I was using</p>
<p>the fictional example of, all right, some people say,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say with a straight face, they think, no,</p>
<p>you are less productive if you work</p>
<p>more than 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re generally misinterpreting things</p>
<p>where your marginal productivity for an hour</p>
<p>after eight hours is less than in one of your peak hours</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not literally getting less done.</p>
<p>There is a point where you start breaking things</p>
<p>and getting worse behavior and everything out of it</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re literally going backwards</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not at eight or 10 or 12 hours.</p>
<p>And the fictional example I would use was,</p>
<p>imagine there&rsquo;s an asteroid coming to impact,</p>
<p>to crash into Earth, destroy all of human life.</p>
<p>Do you want Elon Musk or the people working at SpaceX</p>
<p>that are building the interceptor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to deflect the asteroid,</p>
<p>do you want them to clock out at five</p>
<p>because damn it, they&rsquo;re just gonna go do worse work</p>
<p>if they work another couple hours.</p>
<p>And it seems absurd.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a hypothetical though</p>
<p>and everyone can dismiss that.</p>
<p>But then when coronavirus was hitting</p>
<p>and you have all of these medical personnel</p>
<p>that are clearly pushing themselves really, really hard</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say, it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>do you want all of these scientists working on treatments</p>
<p>and vaccines and caring for all of these people?</p>
<p>Are they really screwing everything up</p>
<p>by working more than eight hours a day?</p>
<p>And of course people say, I&rsquo;m just an asshole</p>
<p>to say something like that, but it&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>Working longer gets more done.</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s kind of the layer one.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to also say that,</p>
<p>at least I believe, depending on the person,</p>
<p>depending on the task, working more and harder</p>
<p>will make you better for the next week</p>
<p>in those peak hours.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about a deep dedication to a thing</p>
<p>that kind of gets deep in you.</p>
<p>So the hard work isn&rsquo;t just about the raw hours</p>
<p>of productivity, it&rsquo;s the thing it does to you</p>
<p>in the weeks and months after too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re tempering yourself in some ways.</p>
<p>And I think, it&rsquo;s like Jiro dreams of sushi.</p>
<p>If you really dedicate yourself completely</p>
<p>to making the sushi, to really putting in the long hours,</p>
<p>day after day after day, you become a true craftsman</p>
<p>of the thing you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s, of course, discussions about</p>
<p>are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships?</p>
<p>Are you sacrificing a lot of other possible things</p>
<p>you could do with that time?</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re talking about purely being a master</p>
<p>or a craftsman of your art,</p>
<p>that more hours isn&rsquo;t just about doing more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about becoming better at the thing you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t gainsay anybody</p>
<p>that wants to work the minimum amount.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got other priorities in their life.</p>
<p>My only argument that I&rsquo;m making,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that everybody should work hard,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that if you want to accomplish something,</p>
<p>working longer and harder</p>
<p>is the path to getting it accomplished.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about this then,</p>
<p>the mythical work life balance.</p>
<p>For an engineer, it seems like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the professions for a programmer</p>
<p>where working hard does lead to greater productivity in it.</p>
<p>But it also raises the question of</p>
<p>sort of personal relationships and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>family, and how are you able to find work life balance?</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give,</p>
<p>maybe even outside of yourself?</p>
<p>Have you been able to arrive at any wisdom</p>
<p>on this part in your years of life?</p>
<p>I do think that there&rsquo;s a wide range of people</p>
<p>where different people have different needs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a one size fits all.</p>
<p>I am certainly what works for me.</p>
<p>I can tell enough that I&rsquo;m different</p>
<p>than a typical average person</p>
<p>in the way things impact me,</p>
<p>the things that I want to do,</p>
<p>my goals are different,</p>
<p>and sort of the levers to impact things are different,</p>
<p>where I have literally never felt burnout,</p>
<p>and I know there&rsquo;s lots of brilliant, smart people</p>
<p>that do world leading work that get burned out,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never hit me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been at a point where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t care about this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do this anymore.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always had the flexibility</p>
<p>to work on lots of interesting things.</p>
<p>I can always just turn my gaze to something else</p>
<p>and have a great time working on that.</p>
<p>And so much of the ability to actually work hard</p>
<p>is the ability to have multiple things to choose from</p>
<p>and to use your time on the most appropriate thing.</p>
<p>There are time periods where it&rsquo;s the best time</p>
<p>for me to read a new research paper</p>
<p>that I need to really be thinking hard about it.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a time that maybe I should just scan</p>
<p>and organize my old notes</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just not on top of things.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the time that,</p>
<p>all right, let&rsquo;s go bang out a few hundred lines of code</p>
<p>for something.</p>
<p>So switching between them has been real valuable.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll always have kind of joy in your heart</p>
<p>for all the things you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and that is a kind of work life balance</p>
<p>as a first sort of step.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do. So you&rsquo;re always happy.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Well, happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s like a lot of people would say</p>
<p>that often I look like kind of a grim person,</p>
<p>you know, with just sitting there with a neutral expression</p>
<p>or even like knitted brows and a frown on my face</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m staring at something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happiness looks like for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of true where that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m pushing through this, I&rsquo;m making progress here.</p>
<p>I know that doesn&rsquo;t work for everyone.</p>
<p>I know it doesn&rsquo;t work for most people.</p>
<p>But what I am always trying to do in those cases</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t want to let somebody</p>
<p>that might be a person like that be told by someone else</p>
<p>that no, don&rsquo;t even try that out as an option</p>
<p>where work life balance versus kind of your life&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a small subset of the people</p>
<p>that can be very happy being obsessive about things.</p>
<p>And, you know, obsession can often get things done</p>
<p>that just practical, prudent, pedestrian work won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>or at least won&rsquo;t for a very long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s legends of your nutritional intake</p>
<p>in the early days.</p>
<p>What can you say about sort of as a, you know,</p>
<p>being a programmer as a kind of athlete?</p>
<p>So what was the nutrition that fueled?</p>
<p>I have never been that great on really paying attention</p>
<p>to it where I&rsquo;m good enough that I don&rsquo;t eat a lot.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve never been like a big heavy guy,</p>
<p>but it was interesting where one of the things</p>
<p>that I can remember being an unhappy teenager,</p>
<p>not having enough money and like,</p>
<p>one of the things that bothered me</p>
<p>about not having enough money</p>
<p>is I couldn&rsquo;t buy pizza whenever I wanted to.</p>
<p>So I got rich and then I bought a whole lot of pizza.</p>
<p>So that was defining, like, that&rsquo;s what being rich felt like.</p>
<p>A lot of the little things, like I could buy all the pizza</p>
<p>and comic books and video games that I wanted to.</p>
<p>And it really didn&rsquo;t take that much,</p>
<p>but the pizza was one of those things</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s absolutely true that for a long time</p>
<p>at id Software, I had a pizza delivered every single day.</p>
<p>You know, the delivery guy knew me by name</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t find out until years later</p>
<p>that apparently I was such a good customer</p>
<p>that they just never raised the price on me.</p>
<p>And I was using this six year old price for the pizzas</p>
<p>that they were still kind of sending my way every day.</p>
<p>So you were doing eating once a day or were you?</p>
<p>It would be spread out.</p>
<p>You know, you have a few pieces of pizza,</p>
<p>you have some more later on</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d maybe have something at home.</p>
<p>It was one of the nice things that Facebook Meta</p>
<p>is they feed you quite well.</p>
<p>You get a different, I guess now it&rsquo;s DoorDash</p>
<p>sorts of things delivered,</p>
<p>but they take care of making sure</p>
<p>that everybody does get well fed.</p>
<p>And I probably had better food those six years</p>
<p>that I was working in the Meta office there</p>
<p>than I used to before.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s worked out okay for me.</p>
<p>My health has always been good.</p>
<p>I get a pretty good amount of exercise</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t eat to excess</p>
<p>and I avoid a lot of other kind of not so good</p>
<p>for you things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still doing quite well at my age.</p>
<p>Did you have a kind of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>spiritual experience with food or coffee</p>
<p>or any of that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the programming experience,</p>
<p>you know, with music or like I listen to brown noise</p>
<p>on a program or like creating an environment</p>
<p>and the things you take into your body,</p>
<p>just everything you construct</p>
<p>can become a kind of ritual</p>
<p>that empowers the whole process, the programming.</p>
<p>Did you have that relationship with pizza or?</p>
<p>It would really be with Diet Coke.</p>
<p>I mean, there still is that sense of, you know,</p>
<p>drop the can down, crack open the can of Diet Coke.</p>
<p>All right, now I mean business.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting to work here.</p>
<p>Still to this day?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is Diet Coke still a part of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably eight or nine a day.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Okay, what about your setup?</p>
<p>How many screens?</p>
<p>What kind of keyboard?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting?</p>
<p>What kind of IDE, Emacs Vim or something modern?</p>
<p>Linux, what operating system laptop</p>
<p>or any interesting thing that brings you joy?</p>
<p>So I kind of migrated cultures</p>
<p>where early on through all of game dev,</p>
<p>there was sort of one culture there,</p>
<p>which was really quite distinct</p>
<p>from the more the Silicon Valley venture,</p>
<p>you know, culture for things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different groups</p>
<p>and they have pretty different mores</p>
<p>and the way they think about things where,</p>
<p>and I still do think a lot of the big companies</p>
<p>can learn things from the hardcore game development</p>
<p>side of things where it still boggles my mind</p>
<p>how hostile to debuggers and IDEs that so much of them,</p>
<p>the kind of big money, get billions of dollars,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley venture backed funds are.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Sorry, so you&rsquo;re saying like big companies</p>
<p>like Google and Meta are hostile to?</p>
<p>They are not big on debuggers and IDEs.</p>
<p>Like so much of it is like Emacs, Vim for things.</p>
<p>And we just assume that debuggers don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>most of the time for the systems.</p>
<p>And a lot of this comes from a sort of Linux bias</p>
<p>on a lot of things where I did come up</p>
<p>through the personal computers and then the DOS</p>
<p>and then Windows and it was Borland tools</p>
<p>and then Visual Studio and.</p>
<p>Do you appreciate the buggers?</p>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<p>I mean, a debugger is how you get a view into a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too complicated to understand.</p>
<p>I mean, anybody that thinks just read the code</p>
<p>and think about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an insane statement in the,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even read all the code on a big system.</p>
<p>You have to do experiments on the system</p>
<p>and doing that by adding log statements,</p>
<p>recompiling and rerunning it</p>
<p>is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, you can always get things done</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re working with stone knives and bear skins.</p>
<p>That is the mark of a good programmer</p>
<p>is that given any tools,</p>
<p>you will figure out a way to get it done,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing what you can do</p>
<p>with sometimes much, much better tools</p>
<p>where instead of just going through this iterative</p>
<p>compile run debug cycle,</p>
<p>you have the old Lisp direction of like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a REPL and you&rsquo;re working interactively</p>
<p>and doing amazing things there.</p>
<p>But in many cases, a debugger</p>
<p>as a very powerful user interface that can stop,</p>
<p>examine all the different things in your program,</p>
<p>set all of these different breakpoints.</p>
<p>And of course you can do that with GDB or whatever there,</p>
<p>but this is one of the user interface</p>
<p>fundamental principles</p>
<p>where when something is complicated to do,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t use it very often.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that will break out GDB</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re at their wits end</p>
<p>and they just have beat their head</p>
<p>against a problem for so long.</p>
<p>But for somebody that kind of grew up in game dev,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they were running into the debugger anyways</p>
<p>before they even knew there was a problem.</p>
<p>And you would just stop and see what was happening.</p>
<p>And sometimes you could fix things</p>
<p>even before you did one compile cycle.</p>
<p>You could be in the debugger and you would say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m just going to change this right here.</p>
<p>And yep, that did the job and fix it and go on.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>GDB is a sort of popular, I guess, Linux debugger</p>
<p>primarily for C++.</p>
<p>They handle most of the languages,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s based on C as the original kind of Unix heritage.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like command line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not user friendly.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow for clean visualizations</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>So that you&rsquo;re using this kind of debugger</p>
<p>usually when you&rsquo;re at what&rsquo;s end</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a problem that you can&rsquo;t figure out why</p>
<p>by just looking at the codes, you have to find it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I guess normal programmers use it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying there should be tools</p>
<p>that kind of visualize and help you</p>
<p>as part of the programming process,</p>
<p>just the normal programming process</p>
<p>to understand the code deeper.</p>
<p>Yeah, when I&rsquo;m working on like my C, C++ code,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always running it from the debugger.</p>
<p>Just I type in the code, I run it many times.</p>
<p>The first thing I do after writing code</p>
<p>is set a break point and step through the function.</p>
<p>Now other people will say, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, I do that in my head.</p>
<p>Well, your head is a faulty interpreter</p>
<p>of all those things there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve written brand new code.</p>
<p>I wanna step in there</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna single step through that,</p>
<p>examine lots of things</p>
<p>and see if it&rsquo;s actually doing what I expected it to.</p>
<p>It is a kind of companion, the debugger.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re now coding in an interactive way</p>
<p>with another being.</p>
<p>The debugger is a kind of dumb being,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a reliable being.</p>
<p>That is an interesting question</p>
<p>of what role does AI play in that kind of,</p>
<p>with codecs and these kind of ability to generate code,</p>
<p>that might be, you might start having tools</p>
<p>that understand the code in interesting deep ways</p>
<p>that can work with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole spectrum there</p>
<p>from static code analyzers and various kind of dynamic tools</p>
<p>there up to AI that can conceivably grok these programs</p>
<p>that literally no human can understand.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too big, too intertwined and too interconnected,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not beyond the possibility of understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just beyond what we can hold in our heads</p>
<p>as kind of mutable state while we&rsquo;re working on things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a big proponent, again,</p>
<p>of things like static analyzers and some of that stuff</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll find some people that don&rsquo;t like being scolded</p>
<p>by a program for how they&rsquo;ve written something</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, oh, I know better.</p>
<p>And sometimes you do, but that was something</p>
<p>that it was very, very valuable for me</p>
<p>when, and not too many people get an opportunity</p>
<p>like this to have.</p>
<p>This is almost one of those spiritual experiences</p>
<p>as a programmer, an awakening to,</p>
<p>the id software code bases</p>
<p>were a couple of million lines of code.</p>
<p>And at one point I had used a few</p>
<p>of the different analysis tools,</p>
<p>but I made a point to really go through</p>
<p>and scrub the code base using every tool that I could find.</p>
<p>And it was eyeopening where we had a reputation</p>
<p>for having some of the most robust, strongest code,</p>
<p>where there were some great things</p>
<p>that I remember hearing from Microsoft</p>
<p>telling us about crashes on Xbox.</p>
<p>And we had this tiny number that they said</p>
<p>were probably literally hardware errors.</p>
<p>And then you have other significant titles</p>
<p>that just have millions of faults</p>
<p>that are getting recorded all the time.</p>
<p>So I was proud of our code on a lot of levels,</p>
<p>but when I took this code analysis squeegee</p>
<p>through everything, it was shocking</p>
<p>how many errors there were in there.</p>
<p>Things that you can say, okay, this was a copy paste,</p>
<p>not changing something right here.</p>
<p>Lots of things that were, the most common problem</p>
<p>was something in a printf format string</p>
<p>that was the wrong data type that could cause crashes there.</p>
<p>And you really want the warnings for things like that.</p>
<p>Then the next most common was missing a check for null</p>
<p>that could actually happen, that could blow things up.</p>
<p>And those are obviously like top C, C++ things.</p>
<p>Everybody has those problems.</p>
<p>But the long tail of all of the different little things</p>
<p>that could go wrong there, and we had good programmers</p>
<p>and my own code, stuff that I&rsquo;d be looking at,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, I wrote that code, that&rsquo;s definitely wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been using this for a year</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this submarine, this mine sitting there</p>
<p>waiting for us to step on.</p>
<p>And it was humbling.</p>
<p>It was, and I reached the conclusion</p>
<p>that anything that can be syntactically allowed</p>
<p>in your language, if it&rsquo;s gonna show up eventually</p>
<p>in a large enough code base,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna, good intentions</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to keep it from happening.</p>
<p>You need automated tools and guardrails for things.</p>
<p>And those start with things like static types</p>
<p>and or even type hints in the more dynamic languages.</p>
<p>But the people that rebel against that,</p>
<p>that basically say that slows me down doing that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to that, I get that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written, I&rsquo;ve cobbled things together in a notebook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, this is great that it just happened,</p>
<p>but yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of sketchy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s working fine, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It does come back to that value analysis</p>
<p>where sometimes it&rsquo;s right to not care.</p>
<p>But when you do care, if it&rsquo;s going to be something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to live for years</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna have other people working on it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be deployed to millions of people,</p>
<p>then you wanna use all of these tools.</p>
<p>You wanna be told it&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve screwed up here, here and here.</p>
<p>And that does require kind of an ego check about things</p>
<p>where you have to be open to the fact</p>
<p>that everything that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is just littered with flaws.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that, oh, you occasionally have a bad day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just whatever stream of code you output,</p>
<p>there is going to be a statistical regularity of things</p>
<p>that you just make mistakes on.</p>
<p>And I do think there&rsquo;s the whole argument</p>
<p>about test driven design and unit testing</p>
<p>versus kind of analysis and different things.</p>
<p>I am more in favor of the analysis and the stuff</p>
<p>that just like you can&rsquo;t run your program</p>
<p>until you fix this rather than you can run it</p>
<p>and hopefully a unit test will catch it in some way.</p>
<p>Yeah, in my private code, I have asserts everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something pleasant to me, pleasurable to me</p>
<p>about sort of the dictatorial rule of like,</p>
<p>this should be true at this point.</p>
<p>And too many times I&rsquo;ve made mistakes</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t have been made.</p>
<p>And I would assume I wouldn&rsquo;t be the kind of person</p>
<p>that would make that mistake,</p>
<p>but I keep making that mistake.</p>
<p>Therefore, an assert really catches me,</p>
<p>really helps all the time.</p>
<p>So my code, I would say like 10 to 20% of my private code</p>
<p>just for personal use is probably asserts.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re active comments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of those things that in theory,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make any difference to the program.</p>
<p>And if it was all operating the way you expected</p>
<p>it would be, then they will never fire.</p>
<p>But even if you have it right</p>
<p>and you wrote the code right initially,</p>
<p>then circumstances change.</p>
<p>The world outside your program changes.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m kind of fond in a lot of cases</p>
<p>of static array size declarations,</p>
<p>where I went through this period where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, now we have general collection classes.</p>
<p>We should just make everything variable</p>
<p>because I had this history of in the early days,</p>
<p>you get doom, which had some fixed limits on it.</p>
<p>Then everybody started making crazier and crazier things.</p>
<p>And they kept bumping up the different limits,</p>
<p>this many lines, this many sectors.</p>
<p>And it seemed like a good idea,</p>
<p>well, we should just make this completely generic.</p>
<p>It can go kind of go up to whatever.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s cases where that&rsquo;s the right thing to do,</p>
<p>but it also, the other aspect of the world</p>
<p>changing around you is it&rsquo;s good to be informed</p>
<p>when the world has changed more than you thought it would.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve got a continuously growing collection,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna find out.</p>
<p>You might have this quadratic slow down on something</p>
<p>where you thought, oh, I&rsquo;m only ever gonna have</p>
<p>a handful of these, but something changes</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a new design style.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got 10,000 of them.</p>
<p>So I kind of like in many cases, picking a number,</p>
<p>some nice brown power of two number</p>
<p>and setting it up in there and having an assert saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, hey, you hit this limit.</p>
<p>You should probably think are the choices</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve made around all of this still relevant</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s using 10 times more</p>
<p>than you thought they would.</p>
<p>Yeah, this code was originally written</p>
<p>with this kind of worldview,</p>
<p>with this kind of set of constraints.</p>
<p>You were thinking of the world in this way.</p>
<p>If something breaks, that means you gotta rethink</p>
<p>the initial stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice for it to do that.</p>
<p>Is there any stuff like a keyboard or monitors?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fairly pedestrian on a lot of that</p>
<p>where I did move to triple monitors</p>
<p>like in the last several years ago.</p>
<p>I had been dual monitor for a very long time.</p>
<p>And it was one of those things where probably years later</p>
<p>than I should have, I&rsquo;m just like, well,</p>
<p>the video cards now generally have three output ports.</p>
<p>I should just put the third monitor up there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been a pure win.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very happy with that.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t have fancy keyboard or mouse</p>
<p>or anything really going on.</p>
<p>The key things is an IDE that has helpful debuggers,</p>
<p>has helpful tools.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the Emacs Vim route and then Dicode.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I did spend,</p>
<p>I spent one of my week long retreats where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m gonna make myself use,</p>
<p>it was actually classic VI,</p>
<p>which I know people will say you should never have done that.</p>
<p>You should have just used Vim directly.</p>
<p>But I gave it the good try.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m being in kind of classic</p>
<p>Unix developer mode here.</p>
<p>And I worked for a week on it.</p>
<p>I used Anki to like teach myself</p>
<p>the different little key combinations</p>
<p>for things like that.</p>
<p>And in the end, it was just like, all right,</p>
<p>this was kind of like my civil war reenactment phase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going out there doing it</p>
<p>like they used to in the old days.</p>
<p>And it was kind of fun in that regard.</p>
<p>So many people right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re screaming as they&rsquo;re listening to this.</p>
<p>So again, the out is that this was not modern Vim,</p>
<p>but still, yes, I was very happy to get back</p>
<p>to my visual studio at the end.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m actually, I struggle with this a lot</p>
<p>because I use a Kinesis keyboard</p>
<p>and I use Emacs primarily.</p>
<p>And I feel like I can, exactly as you said,</p>
<p>I can understand the code.</p>
<p>I can navigate the code.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff you could build with an Emacs</p>
<p>with using Lisp.</p>
<p>You can customize a lot of things for yourself</p>
<p>to help you introspect the code,</p>
<p>like to help you understand the code</p>
<p>and visualize different aspects of the code.</p>
<p>You can even run debuggers,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s work and the world moves past you</p>
<p>and the better and better ideas are constantly being built.</p>
<p>And that puts a kind of,</p>
<p>I need to take the same kind of retreat</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m still fighting the civil war.</p>
<p>I need to kind of move into the 21st century.</p>
<p>And it does seem like the world is,</p>
<p>or a large chunk of the world is moving</p>
<p>towards visual studio code,</p>
<p>which is kind of interesting to me.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the JavaScript ecosystem on the one hand</p>
<p>and IDs are one of those things</p>
<p>that you want to be infinitely fast.</p>
<p>You want them to just kind of immediately respond.</p>
<p>And like, I mean, heck, I&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s someone I know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an old school game dev guy</p>
<p>that still uses visual studio six.</p>
<p>And on a modern computer,</p>
<p>everything is just absolutely instant</p>
<p>on something like that,</p>
<p>because it was made to work on a computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 10,000 or a hundred thousand times slower.</p>
<p>So just everything happens immediately.</p>
<p>And all the modern systems just feel,</p>
<p>they feel so crufty when it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, why is this refreshing the screen</p>
<p>and moving around and updating over here?</p>
<p>And something blinks down there</p>
<p>and you should update this.</p>
<p>And there are things that we&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>with that incredible flexibility,</p>
<p>but lots of people get tons of value from it.</p>
<p>And I am super happy that that seems to be winning</p>
<p>over even a lot of the old Vim and Emacs people</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re kind of like,</p>
<p>hey, visual studio codes, maybe not so bad.</p>
<p>I am, that may be the final peacekeeping solution</p>
<p>where everybody is reasonably happy</p>
<p>with something like that.</p>
<p>So can you explain what a dot plan file is</p>
<p>and what role that played in your life?</p>
<p>Does it still continue to play a role?</p>
<p>Back in the early, early days of id Software,</p>
<p>one of our big things that was unique with what we did</p>
<p>is I had adopted next stations</p>
<p>or kind of next step systems</p>
<p>from Steve Jobs&rsquo;s out in the woods away from Apple company.</p>
<p>And they were basically, it was kind of interesting</p>
<p>because I did not really have a background</p>
<p>with the Unix system.</p>
<p>So many of the people they get immersed in that in college</p>
<p>and that sets a lot of cultural expectations for them.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have any of that,</p>
<p>but I knew that my background was,</p>
<p>I was a huge Apple II fan boy.</p>
<p>I was always a little suspicious of the Mac.</p>
<p>I was not really what kind of I wanted to go with.</p>
<p>But when Steve Jobs left Apple and started Next,</p>
<p>this computer did just seem like one of those amazing things</p>
<p>from the future where it had all of this cool stuff in it.</p>
<p>And we were still back in those days working on DOS,</p>
<p>everything blew up.</p>
<p>You had reset buttons</p>
<p>because your computer would just freeze.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing development work,</p>
<p>literally dozens of times a day,</p>
<p>your computer was just rebooting constantly.</p>
<p>And so this idea of, yes, any of the Unix workstations</p>
<p>would have given a stable development platform</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t crash and reboot all the time.</p>
<p>But Next also had this really amazing graphical interface</p>
<p>and it was great for building tools.</p>
<p>And it used Objective C as kind of an interesting dead end</p>
<p>for things like that.</p>
<p>So Next was Unix based, it said Objective C.</p>
<p>So it has a lot of the elements.</p>
<p>That became Mac.</p>
<p>I mean, the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple by Next</p>
<p>where that took over</p>
<p>and became what the modern Mac system is.</p>
<p>And to find some of the developer,</p>
<p>like the tools and the whole community.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve still got,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re programming on Apple stuff now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still all these NS somethings,</p>
<p>which was originally Next step objects</p>
<p>of different kinds of things.</p>
<p>But one of the aspects of those Unix systems</p>
<p>was they had this notion of a.plan file</p>
<p>where a.file is an invisible file.</p>
<p>Usually in your home directory or something.</p>
<p>And there was a trivial server running</p>
<p>on most Unix systems at the time</p>
<p>that when somebody ran a trivial little command</p>
<p>called finger, you could do finger</p>
<p>and then somebody&rsquo;s address,</p>
<p>it could be anywhere on the internet</p>
<p>if you were connected correctly.</p>
<p>Then all that server would do was read the.plan file</p>
<p>in that user&rsquo;s home directory</p>
<p>and then just spit it out to you.</p>
<p>And originally the idea was that could be</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re on vacation, what your current project was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be like the plan of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And people would use it for various purposes,</p>
<p>but all it did was dump that file over</p>
<p>to the terminal of whoever issued the finger command.</p>
<p>And at one point I started just keeping a list</p>
<p>of what I was doing in there,</p>
<p>which would be what I was working on in the day.</p>
<p>And I would have this little syntax.</p>
<p>I kind of got to myself about,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I put a star when I finish it.</p>
<p>I could have a few other little bits of punctuation.</p>
<p>And at the time it was,</p>
<p>it started off as being just like my to do list.</p>
<p>And it would be these trivial, obscure little things</p>
<p>like I fixed something with collision detection code,</p>
<p>made Fireball do something different</p>
<p>and just little one liners that people</p>
<p>that were following the games could kind of decipher.</p>
<p>But I did wind up starting to write much more in depth things.</p>
<p>I would have little notes of thoughts and insights</p>
<p>and then I would eventually start having little essays.</p>
<p>I would sometimes dump into the dot plan files</p>
<p>interspersed with the work logs of things that I was doing.</p>
<p>So in some ways it was like a super early proto blog</p>
<p>where I was just kind of dumping out what I was working on.</p>
<p>But it was interesting enough that there were a lot</p>
<p>of people that were interested in this.</p>
<p>So most of the people didn&rsquo;t have Unix workstation.</p>
<p>So there were the websites back in the day</p>
<p>that would follow the Doom and Quake development</p>
<p>that would basically make a little service</p>
<p>that would go grab all the changes</p>
<p>and then people could just get it with a web browser.</p>
<p>And there was a period where like all of the little</p>
<p>kind of Dallas gaming diaspora of people</p>
<p>that were at all in that orbit,</p>
<p>there were a couple dozen plan files going on,</p>
<p>which was, and this was some years before blogging</p>
<p>really became kind of a thing.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a premonition</p>
<p>of sort of the way things would go.</p>
<p>And there was, it&rsquo;s all been collected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available online in different places.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of fun to go back and look through</p>
<p>what I was thinking, what I was doing in the different areas.</p>
<p>Have you had a chance to look back?</p>
<p>Is there some interesting, very low level specific</p>
<p>to do items, maybe things you&rsquo;ve never completed,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff and high level philosophical essay</p>
<p>type of stuff that stands out?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some good stuff on both</p>
<p>where a lot of it was low level nitpicky details</p>
<p>about game dev and I&rsquo;ve learned enough things</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no project that I worked on</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t go back and do a better job on now.</p>
<p>I mean, you just, you learn things,</p>
<p>hopefully if you&rsquo;re doing it right,</p>
<p>you learn things as you get older</p>
<p>and you should be able to do a better job</p>
<p>at all of the early things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s stuff in Wolfenstein Doomquake that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, clearly I could go back and do a better job at this,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s something in the rendering engine side</p>
<p>or how I implemented the monster behaviors</p>
<p>or managed resources or anything like that.</p>
<p>Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?</p>
<p>Like looking back?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes I&rsquo;ll get the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at it and say, yeah, I had a pretty clear view</p>
<p>of I was doing good work there.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t really hit the point</p>
<p>where there was another programmer, Graham Devine,</p>
<p>who was, he had worked at ID and Seventh Guest</p>
<p>and he made some comment one time</p>
<p>where he said he looked back at some of his old notes</p>
<p>and he was like, wow, I was really smart back then.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t hit that so much where,</p>
<p>I mean, I look at it and I always know that,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s all the, you know, with aging,</p>
<p>you get certain changes in how you&rsquo;re able to work problems,</p>
<p>but all of the problems that I&rsquo;ve worked,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that I could do a better job on all of them.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So you can still step right in.</p>
<p>If you could travel back in time and talk to that guy,</p>
<p>you would teach him a few things.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>What about the high level philosophical stuff?</p>
<p>Is there some insights that stand out that you remember?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things that I was understanding about development</p>
<p>and, you know, in the industry and so on</p>
<p>that were in a more primitive stage</p>
<p>where I definitely learned a lot more in the later years</p>
<p>about business and organization and team structure.</p>
<p>There were, I mean, there were definitely things</p>
<p>that I was not the best person</p>
<p>or even a very good person about managing,</p>
<p>like how a team should operate internally,</p>
<p>how people should work together.</p>
<p>I was just, you know, just get out of my way</p>
<p>and let me work on the code and do this.</p>
<p>And more and more, I&rsquo;ve learned how,</p>
<p>in the larger scheme of things,</p>
<p>how sometimes relatively unimportant</p>
<p>some of those things are,</p>
<p>where it is this user value generation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the overarching importance for all of that.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t necessarily have my eye on that ball correctly</p>
<p>through a lot of my, you know, my earlier years.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s things that, you know,</p>
<p>I could have gotten more out of people</p>
<p>handling things in different ways.</p>
<p>I am, you know, I could have made, you know,</p>
<p>in some ways more successful products</p>
<p>by following things in different ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s mistakes that we made</p>
<p>that we couldn&rsquo;t really have known</p>
<p>how things would have worked out,</p>
<p>but it was interesting to see in later years companies</p>
<p>like Activision showing that,</p>
<p>hey, you really can just do the same game,</p>
<p>make it better every year.</p>
<p>And you can look at that from a negative standpoint</p>
<p>and say, it&rsquo;s like, oh, that&rsquo;s just being derivative</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>But if you step back again and say, it&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>are the people buying it still enjoying it?</p>
<p>Are they enjoying it more</p>
<p>than what they might have bought otherwise?</p>
<p>And you can say, no, that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a great value creation engine to do that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a position where you can.</p>
<p>I, you know, don&rsquo;t be forced into reinventing everything</p>
<p>just because you think that you need to.</p>
<p>You know, lots of things about business and team stuff</p>
<p>that could be done better, but the technical work,</p>
<p>the kind of technical visionary type stuff</p>
<p>that I laid out, I still feel pretty good about.</p>
<p>There are some classic old ones about my defending</p>
<p>of OpenGL versus D3D,</p>
<p>which turned out to be one of the more</p>
<p>probably important momentous things there</p>
<p>where it never, it was always a rear guard action on Windows</p>
<p>where Microsoft was just not gonna let that win.</p>
<p>But when I look back on it now,</p>
<p>that fight to keep OpenGL relevant</p>
<p>for a number of years there</p>
<p>meant that OpenGL was there when mobile started happening</p>
<p>and OpenGL ES was the thing that drove</p>
<p>all of the acceleration of the mobile industry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really only in the last few years</p>
<p>as Apple&rsquo;s moved to Metal</p>
<p>and some of the other companies have moved to Vulkan</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s moved away.</p>
<p>But really stepping back and looking at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, I sold tens of millions of games</p>
<p>for different things.</p>
<p>But billions and billions of devices wound up</p>
<p>with an appropriate capable graphics API</p>
<p>due in no small part to me thinking</p>
<p>that that was really important</p>
<p>that we not just give up and use Microsoft&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at that time really terrible API.</p>
<p>The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don&rsquo;t stay terrible.</p>
<p>They were terrible at the start, but a few versions on,</p>
<p>they were actually quite good.</p>
<p>And there was a completely fair argument to be made</p>
<p>that by the time DX9 was out,</p>
<p>it was probably a better programming environment</p>
<p>than OpenGL, but it was still a wonderful good thing</p>
<p>that we had an open standard</p>
<p>that could show up on Linux and Android and iOS</p>
<p>and eventually WebGL still to this day.</p>
<p>So that was one, that would be on my greatest hits list</p>
<p>of things that I kind of pushed with.</p>
<p>The impact it had on billions of devices, yes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>Can you tell the origin story of id Software?</p>
<p>Again, one of the greatest game developer companies ever.</p>
<p>It created Wolfenstein 3D games</p>
<p>that defined my life also in many ways</p>
<p>as a thing that made me realize</p>
<p>what computers are capable of in terms of graphics,</p>
<p>in terms of performance, it just unlocked something deep</p>
<p>in me and understanding what these machines are all about</p>
<p>as games can do that.</p>
<p>So Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake,</p>
<p>and just all the incredible engineering innovation</p>
<p>that went into that.</p>
<p>So how did it all start?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll caveat upfront</p>
<p>that I usually don&rsquo;t consider myself the historian</p>
<p>of the software side of things.</p>
<p>I usually do kind of point people at John Romero</p>
<p>for stories about the early days where I&rsquo;ve never been,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve commented that I&rsquo;m a remarkably</p>
<p>unsentimental person in some ways</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t really spend a lot of time</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m explicitly prodded to go back</p>
<p>and think about the early days of things.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t necessarily make the effort</p>
<p>to archive everything exactly in my brain.</p>
<p>And the more that I work on machine learning and AI</p>
<p>and the aspects of memory</p>
<p>and how when you go back and polish certain things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily exactly the way it happened.</p>
<p>But having said all of that, from my view,</p>
<p>the way everything happened that led up to that was</p>
<p>after I was an adult</p>
<p>and kind of taking a few college classes</p>
<p>and deciding to drop out, I was doing,</p>
<p>I was hardscrabble contract programming work,</p>
<p>really struggling to kind of keep groceries</p>
<p>and pay my rent and things.</p>
<p>And the company that I was doing the most work for</p>
<p>was a company called Softdisk Publishing,</p>
<p>which had the sounds bizarre now business model</p>
<p>of monthly subscription software.</p>
<p>Before there was an internet that people could connect to</p>
<p>and get software, you would pay a certain amount</p>
<p>and every month they would send you a disc</p>
<p>that had some random software on it.</p>
<p>And people that were into computers</p>
<p>thought this was kind of cool.</p>
<p>And they had different ones for the Apple II,</p>
<p>the 2GS, the PC, the Mac, the Amiga,</p>
<p>lots of different things here.</p>
<p>So quirky little business,</p>
<p>but I was doing a lot of contract programming for them</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;d write tiny little games</p>
<p>and sell them for 300, $500.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I was doing again</p>
<p>to keep my head above water here was</p>
<p>I decided that I could make one program</p>
<p>and I could port it to multiple systems.</p>
<p>So I would write a game like Dark Designs or Catacombs</p>
<p>and I would develop it on the Apple II, the 2GS</p>
<p>and the IBM PC, which apparently was the thing</p>
<p>that really kind of piqued the attention</p>
<p>of the people working down there.</p>
<p>Like Jay Wilbur was my primary editor</p>
<p>and Tom Hall was a secondary editor.</p>
<p>And they kept asking me, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, you should come down and work for us here.</p>
<p>And I pushed it off a couple of times</p>
<p>because I was really enjoying my freedom</p>
<p>of kind of being off on my own.</p>
<p>Even if I was barely getting by, I loved it.</p>
<p>I was doing nothing but programming all day,</p>
<p>but I did have enough close scrapes with like,</p>
<p>damn, I&rsquo;m just really out of money</p>
<p>that maybe I should get an actual job</p>
<p>rather than contracting these kind of one at a time things.</p>
<p>And Jay Wilbur was great.</p>
<p>He was like FedExing me the checks when I would need them.</p>
<p>I had to kind of get over whatever hump I was at.</p>
<p>So I took the, I finally took them up on their offer</p>
<p>to come down to Shreveport, Louisiana.</p>
<p>I was in Kansas city at the time,</p>
<p>drove down to through the Ozarks and everything</p>
<p>down to Louisiana and saw the soft disk offices,</p>
<p>went through, talked to a bunch of people,</p>
<p>met the people I had been working with remotely</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>But the most important thing for me</p>
<p>was I met two programmers there,</p>
<p>John Romero and Lane Roth that for the first time ever,</p>
<p>I had met programmers that knew more cool stuff than I did</p>
<p>where the world was just different back then.</p>
<p>I was in Kansas city.</p>
<p>It was one of those smartest kid in the school</p>
<p>does all the computer stuff.</p>
<p>The teachers don&rsquo;t have anything to teach him.</p>
<p>But all I had to learn from was these few books</p>
<p>at the library.</p>
<p>It was not much at all.</p>
<p>And there were some aspects of programming</p>
<p>that were kind of black magic to me.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, oh, he knows how to format a track on,</p>
<p>I am on a low level drive programming interface.</p>
<p>And this was, I was still not at all sure</p>
<p>I was gonna take the job,</p>
<p>but I met these awesome programmers</p>
<p>that were doing cool stuff.</p>
<p>And Romero had worked at Origin Systems</p>
<p>and he had done like, so many different games ahead of time</p>
<p>that I did kind of quickly decide,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, I&rsquo;ll go take the job down there.</p>
<p>And I settled down there, moved in</p>
<p>and started working on more little projects.</p>
<p>And the first kind of big change that happened down there</p>
<p>was the company wanted to make a gaming focused,</p>
<p>a PC gaming focused subscription.</p>
<p>Just like all their other,</p>
<p>it was the same formula that they used for everything.</p>
<p>Pay a monthly fee and you&rsquo;ll get a disc</p>
<p>with one or two games just every month</p>
<p>and no choice in what you get, but we think it&rsquo;ll be fun.</p>
<p>And that was the model they were comfortable with</p>
<p>and they said, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna start this gamers edge department.</p>
<p>And all of us that were interested in that,</p>
<p>like me, Romero, Tom Hall was kind of helping us</p>
<p>from his side of things, Jay would peek in</p>
<p>and we had a few other programmers working with us</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>And we were going to just start making games,</p>
<p>just the same model.</p>
<p>And we dived in and it was fantastic.</p>
<p>Do you have to make new games?</p>
<p>Every month.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this, in retrospect, looking back at it,</p>
<p>that sense that I had done all this contract programming</p>
<p>and John Romero had done like far more of this</p>
<p>where he had done one of his teaching himself efforts</p>
<p>was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that sense of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna go make 26 different games,</p>
<p>give them a different theme.</p>
<p>And you learn so much when you go through</p>
<p>and you crank these things out</p>
<p>like on a biweekly, monthly basis,</p>
<p>something like that. From start to finish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like just an idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just from the very beginning to the very end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>It has to be done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no delaying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got deadlines.</p>
<p>And that kind of rapid iteration pressure cooker environment</p>
<p>was super important for all of us developing the skills</p>
<p>that brought us to where we eventually went to.</p>
<p>I mean, people would say like,</p>
<p>like in the history of the Beatles,</p>
<p>like it wasn&rsquo;t them being the Beatles.</p>
<p>It was them playing all of these other early works</p>
<p>that that opportunity to craft all of their skills</p>
<p>before they were famous,</p>
<p>that was very critical to their later successes.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of that here</p>
<p>where we did these games that nobody remembers,</p>
<p>lots of little things that contributed</p>
<p>to building up the skillset for the things</p>
<p>that eventually did make us famous.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dostoevsky wrote The Gambler.</p>
<p>I had to write it in a month, just to make money.</p>
<p>And nobody remembers that probably</p>
<p>because he had to figure out,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s literally,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have enough time to write it fast enough.</p>
<p>So he had to come up with hacks.</p>
<p>Literally,</p>
<p>it again comes down to that point</p>
<p>where pressure and limitation of resources</p>
<p>is surprisingly important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s counterintuitive in a lot of ways</p>
<p>where you just think that if you&rsquo;ve got all the time</p>
<p>in the world and you&rsquo;ve got all the resources in the world,</p>
<p>of course, you&rsquo;re gonna get something better.</p>
<p>But sometimes it really does work out</p>
<p>that the innovations, mother necessity,</p>
<p>where you can, or resource constraints,</p>
<p>and you have to do things when you don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising what you can do.</p>
<p>Is there any good games written in that time?</p>
<p>Would you say?</p>
<p>Some of them are still fun to go back and play</p>
<p>where you get the,</p>
<p>they were all about kind of,</p>
<p>the more modern term is game feel,</p>
<p>about how just the exact feel that things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the grand strategy of the design,</p>
<p>but how running and jumping and shooting</p>
<p>and those things I feel in the moment.</p>
<p>And some of those are still,</p>
<p>if you sat down on them, you kind of go,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the same movement feel,</p>
<p>but you move over and you&rsquo;re like, bang, jump, bang.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, that&rsquo;s kind of cool still.</p>
<p>So you can get lost in the rhythm of the game.</p>
<p>Is that what you mean by feel?</p>
<p>Just like there&rsquo;s something about it that pulls you in?</p>
<p>Nowadays, again, people talk about compulsion loops</p>
<p>and things where it&rsquo;s that sense of exactly</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, what your fingers are doing</p>
<p>on the keyboard, what your eyes are seeing,</p>
<p>and there are gonna be these sequences of things.</p>
<p>Grab the loot, shoot the monster,</p>
<p>jump over the obstacle, get to the end of the level.</p>
<p>These are eternal aspects of game design in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>but there are better and worse ways to do all of them.</p>
<p>And we did so many of these games</p>
<p>that we got a lot of practice with it.</p>
<p>So one of the kind of weird things</p>
<p>that was happening at this time</p>
<p>is John Romero was getting some strange fan mail.</p>
<p>And back in the days, this was before email.</p>
<p>So we literally got letters sometimes and telling him,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, I wanna talk to you about your games.</p>
<p>I wanna reach out, different things.</p>
<p>And eventually it turned out</p>
<p>that these were all coming from Scott Miller</p>
<p>at Apogee Software.</p>
<p>And he was reaching out through,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t think he could contact John directly,</p>
<p>that he would get intercepted.</p>
<p>So he was trying to get him to contact him</p>
<p>through like back channel fan mail,</p>
<p>because he basically was saying,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m making all this money on shareware games.</p>
<p>I want you to make shareware games,</p>
<p>because he had seen some of the games</p>
<p>that Romero had done.</p>
<p>And we looked at Scott Miller&rsquo;s games</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t think they were very good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, that can&rsquo;t be making the kind of money</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s making 10 grand or something</p>
<p>off of this game.</p>
<p>And we really thought that he was full of shit,</p>
<p>that it was a lie trying to get him into this.</p>
<p>But so that was kind of going on at one level.</p>
<p>And it was funny the moment when Romero realized</p>
<p>that he had some of these letters pinned up on his wall,</p>
<p>like all of his fans.</p>
<p>And then we noticed that they all had the same return</p>
<p>address with different names on them,</p>
<p>which was a little bit of a two edged sword there.</p>
<p>Trying to figure out the puzzle laid out before him.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened after I kind of coincident with that</p>
<p>was I was working on a lot of the new technologies</p>
<p>where I was now full on the IBM PC for the first time,</p>
<p>where I was really a long hold out on Apple II forever.</p>
<p>And I loved my Apple II.</p>
<p>It was the computer I always wished I had</p>
<p>when I was growing up.</p>
<p>And when I finally did have one,</p>
<p>I was kind of clinging on to that well past it</p>
<p>sort of good use by day.</p>
<p>Is it the best computer ever made you would you say?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t make judgments like that about it,</p>
<p>but it was positioned in such a way,</p>
<p>especially in the school systems that it impacted</p>
<p>a whole lot of American programmers at least,</p>
<p>where there was programs that the Apple IIs</p>
<p>got into the schools and they had enough capability</p>
<p>that lots of interesting things happened with them.</p>
<p>In Europe, it was different.</p>
<p>You had your Amigas and Ataris and Acorns in the UK</p>
<p>and things that had different things.</p>
<p>But in the United States,</p>
<p>it was probably the Apple II made the most impact</p>
<p>for a lot of programmers of my generation.</p>
<p>But so I was really digging into the IBM</p>
<p>and this was even more so with the total focus</p>
<p>because I had moved to another city</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t know anybody that I wasn&rsquo;t working with.</p>
<p>I had a little apartment and then at Softdisk,</p>
<p>again, the things that drew me to it,</p>
<p>I had a couple of programmers that knew more than I did</p>
<p>and they had a library.</p>
<p>They had a set of books and a set of magazines.</p>
<p>They had a couple of years of magazines,</p>
<p>the old Dr. Dobbs journal and all of these magazines</p>
<p>that had information about things.</p>
<p>And so I was just in total immersion mode.</p>
<p>It was eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming,</p>
<p>particularly the IBM for everything that I was doing.</p>
<p>And I was digging into a lot of these</p>
<p>low level hardware details</p>
<p>that people weren&rsquo;t usually paying attention to,</p>
<p>the way the IBM EGA cards worked, which was fun for me.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t had experience with things at that level.</p>
<p>And back then you could get hardware documentation</p>
<p>just down at the register levels.</p>
<p>This is where the CRTC register is.</p>
<p>This is how the color registers work</p>
<p>and how the different things are applied.</p>
<p>And they were designed for a certain reason.</p>
<p>They were designed for an application.</p>
<p>They had an intended use in mind,</p>
<p>but I was starting to look at other ways</p>
<p>that they could perhaps be exploited</p>
<p>that they weren&rsquo;t initially intended for.</p>
<p>Could you comment on like, first of all, what operating system was there?</p>
<p>What instruction set was it?</p>
<p>Like, what are we talking about?</p>
<p>So this was DOS and x86.</p>
<p>So 16 bit, 8086.</p>
<p>The 286s were there and 386s existed.</p>
<p>They were rare.</p>
<p>We had a couple for our development systems,</p>
<p>but we were still targeting the more broad.</p>
<p>It was all DOS 16 bit.</p>
<p>None of this was kind of DOS extenders and things.</p>
<p>How different is it from the systems of today?</p>
<p>Is it kind of a precursor that&rsquo;s similar?</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>If you open up command.exe or com on Windows,</p>
<p>you see some of the remnants of all of that,</p>
<p>but it was a different world.</p>
<p>It was the 640K is enough world, and nothing was protected.</p>
<p>It crashed all the time.</p>
<p>You had TSRs or terminate and stay resident hacks</p>
<p>on top of things that would cause configuration problems.</p>
<p>All the hardware was manually configured in your auto exec.</p>
<p>So it was a very different world.</p>
<p>But the code is still the same, similar.</p>
<p>You could still write it.</p>
<p>My earliest code there was written in Pascal.</p>
<p>That was what I had learned at an earlier point.</p>
<p>So between BASIC and C++, there was Pascal.</p>
<p>So when BASIC assembly language, some of my intermediate stuff</p>
<p>was, well, you had to for performance.</p>
<p>BASIC was just too slow.</p>
<p>So most of the work that I was doing</p>
<p>as a contract programmer in my teenage years</p>
<p>was assembly language.</p>
<p>Wait, you wrote games in assembly?</p>
<p>Yeah, complete games in assembly language.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s thousands and thousands of lines</p>
<p>of three letter acronyms for the instructions.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t earn the once again greatest programmer ever label</p>
<p>without being able to write a game in assembly.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language.</p>
<p>It was kind of a.</p>
<p>Everybody serious.</p>
<p>See what he said?</p>
<p>Everybody serious.</p>
<p>It was an outlier to use Pascal a little bit,</p>
<p>where there was one famous program called wizardry.</p>
<p>It was one of the great early role playing games</p>
<p>that was written in Pascal.</p>
<p>But it was almost nothing used Pascal there.</p>
<p>But I did learn Pascal.</p>
<p>And I remember doing all of my.</p>
<p>To this day, I sketch in data structures.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m thinking about something, I&rsquo;ll open up a file</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll start writing struct definitions for how</p>
<p>data is going to be laid out.</p>
<p>And Pascal was kind of formative to that</p>
<p>because I remember designing my RPGs in Pascal record</p>
<p>structures and things like that.</p>
<p>And so I had gotten the Pascal compiler for the Apple 2GS</p>
<p>that I could work on.</p>
<p>And the first IBM game that I developed, I did in Pascal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually kind of an interesting story,</p>
<p>again, talking about the constraints and resources</p>
<p>where I had an Apple 2GS.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have an IBM PC.</p>
<p>I wanted to port my applications to IBM</p>
<p>because I thought I could make more money on it.</p>
<p>So what I wound up doing is I rented a PC for a week</p>
<p>and bought a copy of Turbo Pascal.</p>
<p>And so I had a hard one week and this was cutting into</p>
<p>what minimal profit margin I had there.</p>
<p>But I had this computer for a week.</p>
<p>I had to get my program ported before I had to return</p>
<p>the PC and that was kind of what the first thing</p>
<p>that I had done on the IBM PC and what led me</p>
<p>to taking the job at Softdisk.</p>
<p>And Turbo Pascal, how&rsquo;s that different from regular Pascal?</p>
<p>Is it a different compiler or something like that?</p>
<p>It was a product of Borland, which before Microsoft</p>
<p>kind of killed them, they were the hot stuff</p>
<p>developer tools company.</p>
<p>You had Borland, Turbo Pascal and Turbo C</p>
<p>and Prologue, I mean, all the different things.</p>
<p>But what they did was they took a supremely pragmatic</p>
<p>approach of making something useful.</p>
<p>It was one of these great examples where Pascal</p>
<p>was an academic language and you had things like</p>
<p>the UCSDP system that Wizardry was actually written in</p>
<p>that they did manage to make a game with that,</p>
<p>but it was not a super practical system.</p>
<p>While Turbo Pascal was, it was called Turbo</p>
<p>because it was blazingly fast to compile.</p>
<p>I mean, really ridiculously 10 to 20 times faster</p>
<p>than most other compilers at the time.</p>
<p>But it also had very pragmatic access to look,</p>
<p>you can just poke at the hardware in these different ways</p>
<p>and we have libraries that let you do things.</p>
<p>And it was a pretty good, it was a perfectly good way</p>
<p>to write games and this is one of those things</p>
<p>where people have talked about different paths</p>
<p>that computer development could have taken</p>
<p>where C took over the world for reasons</p>
<p>that came out of Unix and eventually Linux.</p>
<p>And that was not a foregone conclusion at all.</p>
<p>And people can make real reasoned rational arguments</p>
<p>that the world might&rsquo;ve been better</p>
<p>if it had gone a Pascal route.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat agnostic on that where I do know</p>
<p>from experience, it was perfectly good enough to do that.</p>
<p>And it had some fundamental improvements</p>
<p>like it had range checked arrays as an option there,</p>
<p>which could avoid many of C&rsquo;s real hazards</p>
<p>that happened in a security space.</p>
<p>But C1, they were basically offering it</p>
<p>about the same level of abstraction.</p>
<p>It was a systems programming language, but.</p>
<p>But you said Pascal had a more emphasis on data structures.</p>
<p>I actually, in the tree of languages,</p>
<p>did Pascal come before C?</p>
<p>They were pretty contemporaneous.</p>
<p>So Pascal&rsquo;s lineage went to Modula 2 and eventually Oberon,</p>
<p>which was another Nicholas word, kind of experimental language.</p>
<p>But they were all good enough at that level.</p>
<p>Now, some of the classic academic oriented Pascals</p>
<p>were just missing fundamental things like, oh, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>access this core system thing because we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>using it to teach students.</p>
<p>But Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes to it</p>
<p>really did make it a completely capable language.</p>
<p>And it had some reasons why you could implement it</p>
<p>as a single pass compiler so it could be way, way faster,</p>
<p>although less scope for optimizations</p>
<p>if you do it that way.</p>
<p>And it did have some range checking options.</p>
<p>It had a little bit better typing capability.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have properly typed enums, sorts of things,</p>
<p>and other stuff that C lacked.</p>
<p>But C was also clearly good enough.</p>
<p>And it wound up with a huge inertia</p>
<p>from the Unix ecosystem and everything that came with that.</p>
<p>Garbage collection?</p>
<p>No, it was not garbage collected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the same kind of thing as C.</p>
<p>Same manual.</p>
<p>So you could still have your use after freeze</p>
<p>and all those other problems.</p>
<p>But just getting rid of array overruns,</p>
<p>at least if you were compiled with that debugging option,</p>
<p>certainly would have avoided a lot of problems</p>
<p>and could have a lot of benefits.</p>
<p>But so anyways, that was the next thing.</p>
<p>I had to learn C because C was where it seemed like most</p>
<p>of the things were going.</p>
<p>So I abandoned Pascal and I started working in C.</p>
<p>I started hacking on these hardware things dealing</p>
<p>with the graphics controllers and the EGA systems.</p>
<p>And what we most wanted to do, so at that time</p>
<p>we were sitting in our darkened office</p>
<p>playing all the different console video games.</p>
<p>And we were figuring out what games</p>
<p>do we want to make for our Gamer&rsquo;s Edge product there.</p>
<p>And so we had one of the first Super Nintendos sitting there.</p>
<p>And we had an older Nintendo looking at all those games.</p>
<p>And the core thing that those consoles did that you just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get on the PC games was this ability</p>
<p>to have a massive scrolling world where</p>
<p>most of the games that you would make on the PC</p>
<p>and earlier personal computers would be a static screen.</p>
<p>You move little things around on it and you interact like that.</p>
<p>Maybe you go to additional screens as you move.</p>
<p>But arcade games and consoles had this wonderful ability</p>
<p>to just have a big world that you&rsquo;re slowly</p>
<p>moving your window through.</p>
<p>And that was for those types of games,</p>
<p>that kind of action exploration adventure games,</p>
<p>that was a super, super important thing.</p>
<p>And PC games just didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And what I had come across was a couple</p>
<p>of different techniques for implementing that on the PC.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not hard, complicated things.</p>
<p>When I explain them now, they&rsquo;re pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>But just nobody was doing it.</p>
<p>You sound like Einstein describing his five papers</p>
<p>is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re nevertheless revolutionary.</p>
<p>So side scrolling is a game changer.</p>
<p>Yeah, and scrolling is a genius invention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either vertical.</p>
<p>And some of the consoles had different limitations</p>
<p>about you could do one but not the other.</p>
<p>And there were similar things going on as advancements,</p>
<p>even in the console space, where you&rsquo;d have the original Mario</p>
<p>game was just horizontal scrolling.</p>
<p>And then later, Mario games added vertical aspects to it</p>
<p>and different things that you were</p>
<p>doing to explore, kind of expand the capabilities there.</p>
<p>And so much of the early game design for decades</p>
<p>was removing limitations, letting you do things</p>
<p>that you envisioned as a designer,</p>
<p>you wanted the player to experience,</p>
<p>but the hardware just couldn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>or you didn&rsquo;t know how to make it happen.</p>
<p>It felt impossible.</p>
<p>You can imagine that you want to create like this big world</p>
<p>through which you can side scroll,</p>
<p>like through which you can walk.</p>
<p>And then you ask yourself a question,</p>
<p>how do I actually build that in a way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the latency is low enough, the hardware can actually</p>
<p>deliver that in such a way that it&rsquo;s a compelling experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we knew what we wanted to do</p>
<p>because we were playing all of these console games,</p>
<p>playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games.</p>
<p>Clearly, there was a whole world of awesome things</p>
<p>there that we just couldn&rsquo;t do on the PC, at least initially.</p>
<p>Because every programmer can tell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you want to scroll, you can just</p>
<p>redraw the whole screen.</p>
<p>But then it turns out, well, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going five frames per second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an interactive fun experience.</p>
<p>You want to be going 30 or 60 frames per second or something.</p>
<p>And it just didn&rsquo;t feel like that was possible.</p>
<p>It felt like the PCs had to get five times faster for you</p>
<p>to make a playable game there.</p>
<p>And interestingly, I wound up with two completely different</p>
<p>solutions for the scrolling problem.</p>
<p>And this is a theme that runs through everything, where</p>
<p>all of these big technical advancements, it turns out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a couple different ways of doing them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like you found the one true way of doing it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see this as we go into 3D games and things later.</p>
<p>But so the scrolling, the first set of scrolling tricks</p>
<p>that I got was the hardware had this ability to,</p>
<p>you could shift inside the window of memory.</p>
<p>So the EGA cards at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory.</p>
<p>And it was awkwardly set up in this planar format,</p>
<p>where instead of having 256 or 24 million colors,</p>
<p>you had 16 colors, which is four bits.</p>
<p>So you had four bit planes, 64k a piece.</p>
<p>Of course, 64k is a nice round number</p>
<p>for 16 bit addressing.</p>
<p>So your graphics card had a 16 bit window</p>
<p>that you could look at.</p>
<p>And you could tell it to start the video scan out</p>
<p>anywhere inside there.</p>
<p>So there were a couple games that</p>
<p>had taken this approach of you could make a 2 by 2 screen</p>
<p>or a 1 by 4 screen.</p>
<p>And you could do scrolling really easily like that.</p>
<p>You could just lay it all out and just pan around there.</p>
<p>But you just couldn&rsquo;t make it any bigger</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s all the memory that was there.</p>
<p>The first insight to the scrolling that I had</p>
<p>was, well, if we make a screen that&rsquo;s just one tile larger,</p>
<p>and we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16 pixels,</p>
<p>the little classic Mario block that you run into,</p>
<p>lots of art gets drawn that way.</p>
<p>And your screen is a certain number of tiles.</p>
<p>But if you had one little buffer region outside of that,</p>
<p>you could easily pan around inside that 16 pixel region.</p>
<p>That could be perfectly smooth.</p>
<p>But then what happens if you get to the edge</p>
<p>and you want to keep going?</p>
<p>The first way we did scrolling was</p>
<p>what I called adaptive tile refresh, which was really</p>
<p>just a matter of you get to the edge</p>
<p>and then you go back to the original point</p>
<p>and then only change the tiles that have actually</p>
<p>that are different between where it was.</p>
<p>In most of the games at the time,</p>
<p>if you think about your classic Super Mario Brothers game,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got big fields of blue sky, long rows</p>
<p>of the same brick texture.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of commonality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a data compression thing.</p>
<p>If you take the screen and you set it down</p>
<p>on top of each other, in general, only about 10%</p>
<p>of the tiles were actually different there.</p>
<p>So this was a way to go ahead and say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m going to move it back, and then I&rsquo;m only</p>
<p>going to change those 10%, 20%, whatever percent tiles there.</p>
<p>And that meant that it was essentially five times faster</p>
<p>than if you were redrawing all of the tiles.</p>
<p>And that worked well enough for us</p>
<p>to do a bunch of these games for Gamer&rsquo;s Edge.</p>
<p>We had a lot of these scrolling games like Slurred Axe</p>
<p>and Shadow Knights and things like that</p>
<p>that we were cranking out at this high rate that</p>
<p>had this scrolling effect on it.</p>
<p>And it worked well enough.</p>
<p>There were design challenges there</p>
<p>where if you made the worst case,</p>
<p>if you made a checkerboard over the entire screen,</p>
<p>you scroll over one and every single tile changes</p>
<p>and your frame rate&rsquo;s now five frames per second</p>
<p>because it had to redraw everything.</p>
<p>So the designers had a little bit</p>
<p>that they had to worry about.</p>
<p>They had to make these relatively plain looking</p>
<p>levels, but it was still pretty magical.</p>
<p>It was something that we hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>And the first thing that we wound up doing with that</p>
<p>was I had just gotten this working,</p>
<p>and Tom Hall was sitting there with me,</p>
<p>and we were looking over at our Super Nintendo on the side</p>
<p>there with Super Mario 3 running.</p>
<p>And we had the technology, we had the tools set up there,</p>
<p>and we stayed up all night.</p>
<p>And we basically cloned the first level</p>
<p>of Super Mario Brothers.</p>
<p>Performance wise as well?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we had our little character running and jumping in there.</p>
<p>It was close to pixel accurate as far</p>
<p>as all the backgrounds and everything,</p>
<p>but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled together</p>
<p>from previous games that I had written.</p>
<p>I just really kitbashed the whole thing together</p>
<p>to make this demo.</p>
<p>And that was one of the rare cases</p>
<p>when I said I don&rsquo;t usually do these all night programming</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably only two memorable ones</p>
<p>that I can think about.</p>
<p>One was the all nighter to go ahead and get</p>
<p>our Dangerous Dave and copyright infringement</p>
<p>is how we titled it.</p>
<p>Because we had a game called Dangerous Dave running around</p>
<p>with a shotgun shooting things, and we were just</p>
<p>taking our most beloved game at the time there, the Super Mario</p>
<p>3, and sticking Dave inside that with this new scrolling</p>
<p>technology that was going perfectly smooth for them</p>
<p>as it ran.</p>
<p>And Tom and I just blearily the next morning left,</p>
<p>and we left a disk on the desk for John Romero and Jay</p>
<p>Wilbur to see and just said, run this.</p>
<p>And we eventually made it back in later in the day,</p>
<p>and it was like they grabbed us and pulled us into the room.</p>
<p>And that was the point where they were like,</p>
<p>we got to do something with this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make a company.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go make our own games, where</p>
<p>this was something that we were able to just kind of hit them</p>
<p>with a hammer of an experience like, wow, this</p>
<p>is just like so much cooler than what we thought</p>
<p>was possible there.</p>
<p>And initially, we tried to get Nintendo</p>
<p>to let us make Super Mario 3 on the PC.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what we wanted to do.</p>
<p>We were like, hey, we can finish this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s line of sight.</p>
<p>This will be great.</p>
<p>And we sent something to Nintendo,</p>
<p>and we heard that it did get looked at in Japan,</p>
<p>and they just weren&rsquo;t interested in that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another one of those life could</p>
<p>have gone a very different way, where</p>
<p>we could have been like Nintendo&rsquo;s house PC team</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>And define the direction of Wolfenstein and Doom and Quake</p>
<p>could have been a Nintendo creation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So at the same time that we were just</p>
<p>doing our first scrolling demos, we</p>
<p>reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee and said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, hey, we do want to make some games.</p>
<p>These things that you think you want, those are nothing.</p>
<p>What do you see what we can actually do now?</p>
<p>This is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>And he just popped right up and sent a check to us,</p>
<p>where at that point, we still thought</p>
<p>he might be a fraud, that he was just lying about all of this.</p>
<p>But he was totally correct on how much money</p>
<p>he was making with his shareware titles.</p>
<p>And this was his real brainstorm about this,</p>
<p>where shareware was this idea that software</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a fixed price.</p>
<p>If you use it, you send out of the goodness of your heart</p>
<p>some money to the creator.</p>
<p>And there were a couple of utilities</p>
<p>that did make some significant success like that.</p>
<p>But for the most part, it didn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>Now, there wasn&rsquo;t much software in a pure shareware model</p>
<p>that was successful.</p>
<p>The Apogee innovation was to take something,</p>
<p>call it shareware, split it into three pieces.</p>
<p>You always made a trilogy.</p>
<p>And you would put the first piece out,</p>
<p>but then you buy the whole trilogy</p>
<p>for some shareware amount, which in reality,</p>
<p>it meant that the first part was a demo,</p>
<p>where you kind of like the demo went everywhere for free</p>
<p>and you paid money to get the whole set.</p>
<p>But it was still play to shareware.</p>
<p>And we were happy to have the first one go everywhere.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a crippled demo, where the first episode</p>
<p>of all these trilogies, it was a real complete game.</p>
<p>And probably 20 times as many people played that part of it,</p>
<p>thought they had a great game, had fond memories of it,</p>
<p>but never paid us a dime.</p>
<p>But enough people were happy with that,</p>
<p>where it was really quite successful.</p>
<p>And these early games that we didn&rsquo;t think very much of</p>
<p>compared to commercial quality games,</p>
<p>but they were doing really good business,</p>
<p>some fairly crude things.</p>
<p>And people, it was good business.</p>
<p>People enjoyed it.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t like you were taking a crapshoot</p>
<p>on what you were getting.</p>
<p>You just played a third of the experience.</p>
<p>And you loved it enough to hand write out a check</p>
<p>and put it in an envelope and address it and send it out</p>
<p>to Apogee to get the rest of them.</p>
<p>So it was a really pretty feel good business prospect there,</p>
<p>because everybody was happy.</p>
<p>They knew what they were getting when they sent it in.</p>
<p>They would send in fan mail.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to the trouble of addressing a letter</p>
<p>and filling out an envelope, you write something in it.</p>
<p>And there were just the literal bags of fan mail</p>
<p>for the shareware games, so people loved them.</p>
<p>I should mention that for you, the definition of wealth</p>
<p>is being able to have pizza whenever you want.</p>
<p>For me, there was a dream that I would play shareware games</p>
<p>over and over, the part that&rsquo;s free, over and over.</p>
<p>And it was very deeply fulfilling experience.</p>
<p>But I dreamed of a time when I could actually</p>
<p>afford the full experience.</p>
<p>And this is kind of this dreamland beyond the horizon</p>
<p>when you could find out what else is there.</p>
<p>In some sense, even just playing the shareware was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the limitation of that.</p>
<p>You know, life is limited, eventually we all die.</p>
<p>In that way, shareware was somehow really fulfilling</p>
<p>to have this kind of mysterious thing beyond what&rsquo;s free</p>
<p>always there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>a part of my childhood is playing shareware games.</p>
<p>That was a really fulfilling experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting how that model still brought joy</p>
<p>to so many people.</p>
<p>The 20X people that played it.</p>
<p>I felt very good about that.</p>
<p>I would run into people that would say,</p>
<p>oh, I loved that game that you had early on,</p>
<p>Commander Keen, whatever.</p>
<p>And no, they meant just the first episode</p>
<p>that they got to see everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me, I played the crap out of Commander Keen.</p>
<p>And that was all good.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But so we were in this position where Scott Miller</p>
<p>was just fronting us cash, saying, yeah, make a game.</p>
<p>But we did not properly pull the trigger and say,</p>
<p>all right, we&rsquo;re quitting our jobs.</p>
<p>We were like, we&rsquo;re gonna do both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna keep working at Softdisk, working on this.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to go ahead and make a new game</p>
<p>for Apogee at the same time.</p>
<p>And this eventually did lead to some legal problems.</p>
<p>And we had trouble.</p>
<p>It all got worked out in the end,</p>
<p>but it was not a good call at the time there.</p>
<p>And your legal mind at the time was not stellar.</p>
<p>You were not thinking in terms of the illegal terms.</p>
<p>No, I definitely wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>None of us were.</p>
<p>And in hindsight, yeah, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>how did we think we were gonna get away</p>
<p>with even using our work computers</p>
<p>to write software for our breakaway new company?</p>
<p>It was not a good plan.</p>
<p>How did Commander Keen come to be?</p>
<p>So the design process, we would start from,</p>
<p>we had some idea of what we wanted to do.</p>
<p>We wanted to do a Mario like game.</p>
<p>It was gonna be a side scroller.</p>
<p>It was gonna use the technology.</p>
<p>We had some sense of what it would have to look like</p>
<p>because of the limitations</p>
<p>of this adaptive tile refresh technology.</p>
<p>It had to have fields of relatively constant tiles.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t just paint up a background</p>
<p>and then move that around.</p>
<p>The early design or all the design for Commander Keen</p>
<p>really came from Tom Hall,</p>
<p>where he was kind of the main creative mind</p>
<p>for the early id software stuff,</p>
<p>where we had an interesting division of things</p>
<p>where Tom was all creative and design.</p>
<p>I was all programming.</p>
<p>John Romero was an interesting bridge</p>
<p>where he was both a very good programmer</p>
<p>and also a very good designer and artist</p>
<p>and kind of straddled between the areas.</p>
<p>But Commander Keen was very much Tom Hall&rsquo;s baby.</p>
<p>And he came up with all the design and backstory</p>
<p>for the different things of kind of a mad scientist,</p>
<p>little kid with building a rocket ship</p>
<p>and a zap gun and visiting alien worlds</p>
<p>and doing all of this that the background</p>
<p>that we lay the game inside of.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a whole lot to any of these things.</p>
<p>Design for us was always just what we needed to do</p>
<p>to make the game that was gonna be so much fun to play.</p>
<p>And we laid out our first trilogy of games,</p>
<p>the shareware formula, it&rsquo;s gonna be three pieces.</p>
<p>We make Commander Keen one, two, and three.</p>
<p>And we just really started busting on all that work.</p>
<p>And it went together really quickly.</p>
<p>It was like three months or something</p>
<p>that while we were still making games every month</p>
<p>for Gamer&rsquo;s Edge, we were sharing technology between that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d write a bunch of code for this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d just kind of use it for both.</p>
<p>Again, not a particularly good idea there</p>
<p>that had consequences for us.</p>
<p>But in three months, we got our first game out</p>
<p>and all of a sudden it was three times as successful</p>
<p>as the most successful thing Apogee had had before.</p>
<p>And we were making like $30,000 a month</p>
<p>immediately from the Commander Keen stuff.</p>
<p>And that was again, a surprise to us.</p>
<p>It was more than we thought that that was gonna make.</p>
<p>And we said, well, we&rsquo;re gonna certainly roll</p>
<p>into another set of titles from this.</p>
<p>And in that three months, I had come up</p>
<p>with a much better way of doing the scrolling technology</p>
<p>that was not the adaptive tile refresh,</p>
<p>which in some ways was even simpler.</p>
<p>And these things, so many of the great ideas of technology</p>
<p>are things that are back of the envelope designs.</p>
<p>I make this comment about modern machine learning</p>
<p>where all the things that are really important</p>
<p>practically in the last decade are,</p>
<p>each of them fits on the back of an envelope.</p>
<p>There are these simple little things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not super dense, hard to understand technologies.</p>
<p>And so the second scrolling trick was just a matter of like,</p>
<p>okay, we know we&rsquo;ve got this 64K window.</p>
<p>And the question was always like,</p>
<p>well, you could make a two by two,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t go off the edge.</p>
<p>But I finally asked, well, what actually happens</p>
<p>if you just go off the edge?</p>
<p>If you take your start and you say, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, I can move over, I&rsquo;m scrolling,</p>
<p>I can move over, I can move down, I&rsquo;m scrolling.</p>
<p>I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, what if I just keep going?</p>
<p>And I say, I&rsquo;m gonna start at,</p>
<p>what happens if I start at FFFE</p>
<p>at the very end of the 64K block?</p>
<p>And it turns out it just wraps back around to the top</p>
<p>of the block.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, well, this makes everything easy.</p>
<p>You can just scroll the screen everywhere</p>
<p>and all you have to draw is just one new line of tiles,</p>
<p>which everything you expose,</p>
<p>it might be unaligned off various parts</p>
<p>of the screen memory, but it just works.</p>
<p>That no longer had the problem of you had to have fields</p>
<p>of the similar colors because it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, you could be having</p>
<p>a completely unique world and you&rsquo;re just drawing</p>
<p>the new strip as it comes on.</p>
<p>But it might be, like you said, unaligned,</p>
<p>so it can be all over the place.</p>
<p>Yes, and it turns out it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I would have two page flipped screens,</p>
<p>as long as they didn&rsquo;t overlap, they moved in series</p>
<p>through this two dimensional window of graphics.</p>
<p>And that was one of those like, well, this is so simple.</p>
<p>This just works, it&rsquo;s faster,</p>
<p>there it seemed like there was no downside.</p>
<p>Funny thing was, it turned out after we shipped titles</p>
<p>with this, there were what they called super VGA cards,</p>
<p>the cards that would allow higher resolutions</p>
<p>and different features that the standard ones didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And on some of those cards,</p>
<p>this was a weird compatibility quirk again,</p>
<p>because nobody thought this was not</p>
<p>what it was designed to do.</p>
<p>And some of those cards had more memory.</p>
<p>They had more than just 256K and four planes.</p>
<p>They had 512K or a megabyte.</p>
<p>And on some of those cards, I scroll my window down</p>
<p>and then it goes into uninitialized memory</p>
<p>that actually exists there</p>
<p>rather than wrapping back around at the top.</p>
<p>And then I was in the tough position</p>
<p>of do I have to track every single one of these?</p>
<p>And it was a mad house back then</p>
<p>with there were 20 different video card vendors</p>
<p>with all slightly different implementations</p>
<p>of their nonstandard functionality.</p>
<p>So either I needed to natively program</p>
<p>all of the VGA cards there to map in that memory</p>
<p>and keep scrolling down through all of that,</p>
<p>or I kind of punted and took the easy solution</p>
<p>of when you finally did run to the edge of the screen,</p>
<p>I accepted a hitch and just copied the whole screen up there.</p>
<p>So on some of those cards, it was a compatibility mode.</p>
<p>In the normal ones, when it all worked fine,</p>
<p>everything was just beautifully smooth.</p>
<p>But if you had one of those cards</p>
<p>where it did not wrap the way I wanted it to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be scrolling around, scrolling around,</p>
<p>and then eventually you&rsquo;d have a little hitch</p>
<p>where 200 milliseconds or something</p>
<p>that was not super smooth as it froze a little bit.</p>
<p>And this is the binary thing.</p>
<p>Is it one of the standard screens</p>
<p>or is it one of the weird ones, the Super VGA ones?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>And so we would default to,</p>
<p>and I think that was one of those</p>
<p>that changed over the kind of course of deployment</p>
<p>where early on we would have a normal mode</p>
<p>and then you would enable the compatibility flag</p>
<p>if your screen did this crazy flickery thing</p>
<p>when you got to a certain point in the game.</p>
<p>And then later, I think it probably got enabled by default</p>
<p>as just more and more of the cards</p>
<p>kind of did not do exactly the right thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the two edged sword</p>
<p>of doing unconventional things with technology</p>
<p>where you can find something that nobody thought about</p>
<p>doing that kind of scrolling trick</p>
<p>when they set up those cards.</p>
<p>But the fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason</p>
<p>when I was relying on that,</p>
<p>then I wound up being broken on some of the later cards.</p>
<p>Let me take a bit of a tangent,</p>
<p>but ask you about the hacker ethic.</p>
<p>Cause you mentioned shareware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting world.</p>
<p>The world of people that make money,</p>
<p>the business and the people that build systems,</p>
<p>the engineers.</p>
<p>And what is the hacker ethic?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a man of the people</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve embodied at least the part of that ethic.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>What did it mean to you at the time?</p>
<p>What does it mean to you today?</p>
<p>So Steven Levy&rsquo;s book, Hackers,</p>
<p>was a really formative book for me as a teenager.</p>
<p>I mean, I read it several times</p>
<p>and there was all of the great lore</p>
<p>of the early MIT era of hackers</p>
<p>and ending up at the end with,</p>
<p>it kind of went through the early MIT hackers</p>
<p>and then the Silicon Valley hardware hackers</p>
<p>and then the game hackers in part three.</p>
<p>And at that time as a teenager,</p>
<p>I really was kind of bitter in some ways.</p>
<p>I thought I was born too late.</p>
<p>I thought I missed the window there.</p>
<p>And I really thought I belonged in that third section</p>
<p>of that book with the game hackers.</p>
<p>And they were talking about the Williams at Sierra</p>
<p>and origin systems with Richard Garriott.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I really wanted to be there.</p>
<p>And I knew that was now a few years in the past.</p>
<p>It was not to be,</p>
<p>but the early days, especially the early MIT hacker days,</p>
<p>talking a lot about this sense of the hacker ethic,</p>
<p>that there was this sense that</p>
<p>it was about sharing information, being good,</p>
<p>not keeping it to yourself,</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s not a zero sum game,</p>
<p>that you can share something with another programmer</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take it away from you.</p>
<p>You then have somebody else doing something.</p>
<p>And I also think that there&rsquo;s an aspect of it</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s this ability to take joy</p>
<p>in other people&rsquo;s accomplishments,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not the cutthroat bit of like,</p>
<p>I have to be first,</p>
<p>I have to be recognized as the one that did this</p>
<p>in some way,</p>
<p>but being able to see somebody else do something</p>
<p>and say, holy shit, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And just taking joy in the ability of something amazing</p>
<p>that somebody else does.</p>
<p>And the big thing that I was able to do through ID Software</p>
<p>was this ability to eventually release the source code</p>
<p>for most of our,</p>
<p>like all of our really seminal game titles.</p>
<p>And that was a, it was a stepping stone process</p>
<p>where we were kind of surprised early on</p>
<p>where people were able to hack the existing games.</p>
<p>And of course I had experience with that.</p>
<p>I remember hacking my copies of Ultima.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d give myself 9999 gold and raise my levels</p>
<p>and break out the sector editor.</p>
<p>And so I was familiar with all of that.</p>
<p>So it was just, it was with a smile</p>
<p>when I started to see people doing that to our games,</p>
<p>I am making level editors for Commander Keen</p>
<p>or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D,</p>
<p>but I made the pitch internally</p>
<p>that we should actually release our own tools</p>
<p>for like what we did, what we use to create the games.</p>
<p>And that was a little bit debatable about,</p>
<p>well, will this let other, we&rsquo;ll give people leg up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that gonna mean for the competition?</p>
<p>But the really hard pitch was to actually release</p>
<p>the full source code for the games.</p>
<p>And it was a balancing act with the other people</p>
<p>inside the company where it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>how the programmers generally did get,</p>
<p>certainly the people that I worked closely with,</p>
<p>they did kind of get that hacker ethic bit</p>
<p>where you wanted to share your code.</p>
<p>You were proud of it.</p>
<p>You wanted other people to take it, do cool things with it.</p>
<p>But interestingly, the broader game industry</p>
<p>is a little more hesitant to embrace that</p>
<p>than like the group of people</p>
<p>that we happen to have at id Software,</p>
<p>where it was always a little interesting to me</p>
<p>seeing how a lot of people in the game modding community</p>
<p>were very possessive of their code.</p>
<p>They did not wanna share their code.</p>
<p>They wanted it to be theirs.</p>
<p>It was their claim to fame.</p>
<p>And that was much more like what we tended to see</p>
<p>with artists where the artists understand something</p>
<p>about credit and wanting it to be known as their work.</p>
<p>And a lot of the game programmers</p>
<p>felt a little bit more like artists</p>
<p>than like hacker programmers,</p>
<p>in that it was about building something</p>
<p>that maybe felt more like art to them</p>
<p>than the more tool based and exploration based</p>
<p>kind of hacking culture side of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so interesting that this kind of fear</p>
<p>that credit will not be sufficiently attributed to you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things that I do bump into a lot</p>
<p>because I try not to go&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s easy for me to say</p>
<p>because so much credit is heaped on me</p>
<p>for the id Software side of things.</p>
<p>But when people come up and they wanna pick a fight</p>
<p>and say, no, it&rsquo;s like that wasn&rsquo;t where first person gaming</p>
<p>came from and you can point to some of like things</p>
<p>on obscure titles that I was never aware of</p>
<p>or like the old Playdoh systems</p>
<p>or each personal computer had something that was 3Dish</p>
<p>and moving around.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to say it&rsquo;s like, no, I mean,</p>
<p>I saw Battlezone and Star Wars in the arcades.</p>
<p>I had seen 3D graphics, I had seen all these things</p>
<p>that are standing on the shoulders of lots of other people.</p>
<p>But sometimes these examples they pull out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, no, I didn&rsquo;t know that existed.</p>
<p>I mean, I had never heard of that before then</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t contribute to what I made,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s plenty of stuff that did.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s good cases to be made</p>
<p>that obviously Doom and Quake and Wolfenstein</p>
<p>were formative examples for what everything</p>
<p>that came after that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t feel the need to go fight</p>
<p>and say claim primacy or initial invention</p>
<p>of anything like that.</p>
<p>But a lot of people do want to.</p>
<p>I think when you fight for the credit in that way</p>
<p>and it does go against the hacker ethic,</p>
<p>you destroy something fundamental about the culture,</p>
<p>about the community that builds cool stuff.</p>
<p>I think credit ultimately,</p>
<p>so I had this sort of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a famous wrestler and freestyle wrestling</p>
<p>called Buvai Sarasateeva.</p>
<p>And he always preached that you should just focus</p>
<p>on the art of the wrestling and let people</p>
<p>write your story however they want.</p>
<p>The highest form of the art is just focusing on the art.</p>
<p>And that is something about the hacker ethic</p>
<p>is just focus on building cool stuff,</p>
<p>sharing it with other cool people,</p>
<p>and credit will get assigned correctly</p>
<p>in the long arc of history.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I generally think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some things, there&rsquo;s a graphics technique</p>
<p>that got labeled CarMax Reverse.</p>
<p>I am literally named,</p>
<p>and it turned out that I wasn&rsquo;t the first person</p>
<p>to figure that out.</p>
<p>Most scientific things or mathematical things you wind up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, this other person</p>
<p>had actually done that somewhat before.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s things that get attributed to me</p>
<p>like the inverse square root hack that I actually didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>I flat out, that wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s weird how the memetic power</p>
<p>of the internet, I cannot convince people of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like the Mark Twain of programming.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Everything just gets attributed to you now,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;ve never sought the credit of things.</p>
<p>But part of the fact of the humility behind that</p>
<p>is what attracts the attributions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a game.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the greatest games ever made.</p>
<p>I know you could talk about doing Quake and so on,</p>
<p>but to me, Wolfenstein 3D was like, whoa.</p>
<p>It blew my mind that a world like this could exist.</p>
<p>So how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be</p>
<p>in terms of the programming, in terms of the design,</p>
<p>in terms of some of the memorable technical challenges?</p>
<p>And also, actually just something you haven&rsquo;t mentioned</p>
<p>is how did these ideas come to be inside your mind,</p>
<p>the adaptive side scrolling,</p>
<p>the solutions to these technical challenges?</p>
<p>So I usually can introspectively pull back</p>
<p>pretty detailed accounts of how technology solutions</p>
<p>and design choices on my part came to be,</p>
<p>where technically we had done two games,</p>
<p>3D games like that before,</p>
<p>where Hover Tank was the first one,</p>
<p>which had flat shaded walls,</p>
<p>but did have the scaled enemies inside it.</p>
<p>And then Catacombs 3D, which had textured walls,</p>
<p>scaled enemies, and some more functionality,</p>
<p>like the disappearing walls and some other stuff.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>from a game development standpoint is those games,</p>
<p>Catacombs 3D, Hover Tank, and Wolfenstein,</p>
<p>they literally used the same code</p>
<p>for a lot of the character behavior</p>
<p>that a 2D game that I had made earlier called Catacombs did,</p>
<p>where it was an overhead view game, kind of like Gauntlet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running around and you can open up doors,</p>
<p>pick up items, basic game stuff.</p>
<p>And the thought was that this exact same game experience</p>
<p>just presented in a different perspective.</p>
<p>It could be literally the same game</p>
<p>just with a different view into it,</p>
<p>would have a dramatically different impact on the players.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a true 3D,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that you could kind of fake it,</p>
<p>you can like scale enemies,</p>
<p>meaning things that are farther away,</p>
<p>you can make them smaller.</p>
<p>So the game was a 2D map,</p>
<p>like all of our games use the same tool for creation.</p>
<p>We use the same map editor for creating Keen as Wolfenstein</p>
<p>and Hover Tank and Catacombs and all this stuff.</p>
<p>So the game was a 2D grid made out of blocks.</p>
<p>And you could say, well, these are walls,</p>
<p>these are where the enemies start,</p>
<p>then they start moving around.</p>
<p>And these early games like Catacombs,</p>
<p>you played it strictly in a 2D view.</p>
<p>It was a scrolling 2D view,</p>
<p>and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh</p>
<p>at the time to be able to do something like that.</p>
<p>And then the thought that these early games,</p>
<p>all it did was take the same basic enemy logic,</p>
<p>but instead of seeing it from the God&rsquo;s eye view on top,</p>
<p>you were inside it and turning from side to side,</p>
<p>yawing your view and moving forwards and backwards</p>
<p>and side to side.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a striking thing where you always talk about</p>
<p>wanting to isolate and factor changes in values.</p>
<p>And this was one of those most pure cases there</p>
<p>where the rest of the game changed very little.</p>
<p>It was our normal kind of change the colors on something</p>
<p>and draw a different picture for it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of the same thing.</p>
<p>But the perspective changed in a really fundamental way.</p>
<p>And it was dramatically different.</p>
<p>I can remember the reactions where the artist, Adrian,</p>
<p>that had been drawing the pictures for it.</p>
<p>We had a cool big troll thing in Catacombs 3D,</p>
<p>and we had these walls that you could get a key</p>
<p>and you could make the blocks disappear,</p>
<p>get really simple stuff.</p>
<p>Blocks could either be there or not there.</p>
<p>So our idea of a door was being able to make a set of blocks</p>
<p>just disappear.</p>
<p>And I remember the reaction</p>
<p>where he had drawn these characters</p>
<p>and he was slowly moving around</p>
<p>and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.</p>
<p>It was all still keyboard.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even have mice set up at that time,</p>
<p>but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.</p>
<p>The wall disappears in a little animation</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a monster like right there.</p>
<p>And he practically fell out of his chair.</p>
<p>It was just like, ah!</p>
<p>And games just didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>The games were the God&rsquo;s eye view.</p>
<p>You were a little invested in your little guy.</p>
<p>You can be like happy or sad when things happen,</p>
<p>but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t inside the game.</p>
<p>Something in the back of your brain,</p>
<p>some reptile brain thing is just going,</p>
<p>oh shit, something just happened.</p>
<p>And that was one of those early points where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yeah, this is gonna make a difference.</p>
<p>This is going to be powerful and it&rsquo;s gonna matter.</p>
<p>Were you able to imagine that in the idea stage or no?</p>
<p>So not that exact thing.</p>
<p>So again, we had cases like the arcade games,</p>
<p>Battle Zone and Star Wars</p>
<p>that you could kind of see a 3D world</p>
<p>and things coming at you and you get some sense of it,</p>
<p>but nothing had done the kind of worlds that we were doing</p>
<p>and the sort of action based things.</p>
<p>3D at the time was really largely</p>
<p>about the simulation thoughts.</p>
<p>And this is something that really</p>
<p>might have trended differently</p>
<p>if not for the id Software approach in the games</p>
<p>where there were flight simulators,</p>
<p>there were driving simulators,</p>
<p>you had like hard drive in and Microsoft flight simulator.</p>
<p>And these were doing 3D and general purpose 3D</p>
<p>in ways that were more flexible</p>
<p>than what we were doing with our games,</p>
<p>but they were looked at as simulations.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t trying to necessarily be fast or responsive</p>
<p>or letting you do kind of exciting maneuvers</p>
<p>because they were trying to simulate reality</p>
<p>and they were taking their cues from the big systems,</p>
<p>the Evans and Sutherlands and the Silicon Graphics</p>
<p>that were doing things.</p>
<p>But we were taking our cues</p>
<p>from the console and arcade games.</p>
<p>We wanted things that were sort of quarter eaters</p>
<p>that were doing fast paced things</p>
<p>that you could smack you around</p>
<p>rather than just smoothly gliding you from place to place.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Quarter eaters.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, a funny thing is,</p>
<p>so much that that built into us</p>
<p>that Wolfenstein still had lives</p>
<p>and you had like one of the biggest power ups</p>
<p>in all these games like was an extra life</p>
<p>because you started off with three lives</p>
<p>and you lose your lives and then it&rsquo;s game over</p>
<p>and there weren&rsquo;t save games in most of this stuff.</p>
<p>It was, it sounds almost crazy to say this,</p>
<p>but it was an innovation in Doom</p>
<p>to not have lives.</p>
<p>You know, you could just play Doom as long as you wanted.</p>
<p>You just restart at the start of the level and why not?</p>
<p>This is like, we aren&rsquo;t trying to take people&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already paid for the entire game.</p>
<p>We want them to have a good time</p>
<p>and you would have some, you know,</p>
<p>some old timer purists that might think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something to the epic journey</p>
<p>of making it to the end,</p>
<p>having to restart all the way from the beginning</p>
<p>after a certain number of tries.</p>
<p>But now more fun is had when you just let people</p>
<p>kind of keep trying when they&rsquo;re stuck</p>
<p>rather than having to go all the way back</p>
<p>and learn different things.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve recommended the book,</p>
<p>Game Engine Black Book Wolfenstein 3D</p>
<p>for technical exploration of the game.</p>
<p>So looking back 30 years,</p>
<p>what are some memorable technical innovations</p>
<p>that made this perspective shift into this world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so immersive that scares you when a monster appears</p>
<p>or some things you have to solve?</p>
<p>So one of the interesting things</p>
<p>that come back to the theme of deadlines</p>
<p>and resource constraints,</p>
<p>the game Catacombs 3D,</p>
<p>we shipped, we were supposed to be shipping this</p>
<p>for Gamers Edge on a monthly cadence and I had slipped.</p>
<p>I was actually late.</p>
<p>It slipped like six weeks</p>
<p>because this was texture mapped walls</p>
<p>doing stuff that I hadn&rsquo;t done before.</p>
<p>And at the six week point,</p>
<p>it was still kind of glitchy and buggy.</p>
<p>There were things that I knew that if you had a wall</p>
<p>that was like almost edge on, you could slide over to it</p>
<p>and you could see some things freak out</p>
<p>or vanish or not work.</p>
<p>And I hated that,</p>
<p>but I was up against the wall.</p>
<p>We had to ship the game.</p>
<p>It was still a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>It was novel, nobody had seen it.</p>
<p>It gave you that startle reflex reaction.</p>
<p>So it was worth shipping,</p>
<p>but it had these things that I knew were kind of flaky</p>
<p>and janky and not what I was really proud of.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I did very differently</p>
<p>in Wolfenstein was I went,</p>
<p>Catacombs used almost a conventional thing</p>
<p>where you had segments that were one dimensional polygons</p>
<p>basically that were clipped and back faced</p>
<p>and done kind of like a very crude 3D engine</p>
<p>from the professionals,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t getting it done right.</p>
<p>I was not doing a good enough job.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really have line of sight to fix it right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff that of course I look back,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s obvious how to do this</p>
<p>and do the math right, do your clipping right,</p>
<p>check all of this, how you handle the precision.</p>
<p>But I did not know how to do that at that time.</p>
<p>Was that the first 3D engine you wrote Catacombs 3D?</p>
<p>Yeah, Hover Tank had been a little bit before that,</p>
<p>but that had the flat shaded walls.</p>
<p>So the texture mapping on the walls</p>
<p>was what was bringing in some of these challenges</p>
<p>that was hard for me</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t solve it right at the time.</p>
<p>Can you describe what flat shading is and texture mapping?</p>
<p>So the walls were solid color,</p>
<p>one of 16 colors in Hover Tank.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast,</p>
<p>you just draw the solid color for everything.</p>
<p>Texture mapping is what we all see today</p>
<p>where you have an image that is stretched and distorted</p>
<p>onto the walls or the surfaces that you&rsquo;re working with.</p>
<p>And it was a long time for me to just figure out</p>
<p>how to do that without it distorting in the wrong ways.</p>
<p>And I did not get it all exactly right in Catacombs</p>
<p>and I had these flaws.</p>
<p>So that was important enough to me</p>
<p>that rather than continuing to bang my head on that</p>
<p>when I wasn&rsquo;t positive I was gonna get it,</p>
<p>I went with a completely different approach</p>
<p>for drawing for figuring out where the walls were</p>
<p>which was a ray casting approach,</p>
<p>which I had done in Catacombs 3D I had a bunch of C code</p>
<p>trying to make this work right and it wasn&rsquo;t working right.</p>
<p>In Wolfenstein I wound up going to a very small amount</p>
<p>of assembly code.</p>
<p>So in some ways there should be a slower way of doing it</p>
<p>but by making it a smaller amount of work</p>
<p>that I could more tightly optimize it worked out</p>
<p>and Wolfenstein 3D was just absolutely rock solid.</p>
<p>It was nothing glitched in there.</p>
<p>The game just was pretty much flawless through all of that</p>
<p>and I was super proud of that.</p>
<p>But eventually like in the later games</p>
<p>I went back to the more span based things</p>
<p>where I could get more total efficiency</p>
<p>once I really did figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>So there were two sort of key technical things</p>
<p>to Wolfenstein, one was this ray casting approach</p>
<p>which you still to this day you see people go and say</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s write a ray casting engine</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an understandable way of doing things</p>
<p>that lets you make games very much like that.</p>
<p>So you see ray casters in JavaScript,</p>
<p>ray casters in Python, people that are basically going</p>
<p>and re implementing that approach to taking a tiled world</p>
<p>and casting out into it.</p>
<p>It works pretty well but it&rsquo;s not the fastest way</p>
<p>of doing it.</p>
<p>Can you describe what ray casting is?</p>
<p>So you start off and you&rsquo;ve got your screen</p>
<p>which is 320 pixels across at the time</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t sized down the window for greater speed</p>
<p>and at every pixel there&rsquo;s gonna be an angle</p>
<p>from you&rsquo;ve got your position in the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to just run along that angle</p>
<p>and keep going until you hit a block.</p>
<p>So up to 320 times across there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna throw a cast array out into the world</p>
<p>from wherever your origin is until it runs into a wall</p>
<p>and then it can figure out exactly where on the wall it hits.</p>
<p>The performance challenge of that is as it&rsquo;s going out</p>
<p>every block it&rsquo;s crossing it checks is this a solid wall.</p>
<p>So that means that in like the early Wolfenstein levels</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a small jail cell going out into a small hallway</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super efficient for that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re only stepping across three or four blocks</p>
<p>but then if somebody makes a room that covers</p>
<p>our maps were limited to 64 by 64 blocks.</p>
<p>If you made one room that was nothing but walls</p>
<p>at the far space it would go pretty slow</p>
<p>because it would be stepping across 80 tile tests</p>
<p>or something along the way.</p>
<p>By the way the physics of our universe</p>
<p>seems to be competing in this very thing.</p>
<p>So this maps nicely to the actual physics of our world.</p>
<p>Yeah you get like I follow a little bit of something</p>
<p>like Steven Wolfram&rsquo;s work on interconnected</p>
<p>network information states of that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s beyond what I can have an informed opinion</p>
<p>on but it&rsquo;s interesting that people are considering</p>
<p>things like that and have things that can back it up.</p>
<p>Yeah there&rsquo;s whole different sets</p>
<p>of interesting stuff there.</p>
<p>So Wolfenstein 3D had ray casting.</p>
<p>Ray casting and then the other kind of key aspect</p>
<p>was what I called compiled scalers</p>
<p>where the idea of you&rsquo;d saw this in the earlier</p>
<p>classic arcade games like Space Harrier and stuff</p>
<p>where you would take a picture which is normally drawn</p>
<p>directly on the screen and then if you have the ability</p>
<p>to make it bigger or smaller big chunky pixels</p>
<p>or fizzly small drop sampled pixels.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental aspect of what our characters</p>
<p>were doing in these 3D games.</p>
<p>You would have it&rsquo;s just like you might have drawn</p>
<p>a tiny little character but now we can make them</p>
<p>really big and make them really small and move it around.</p>
<p>That was the limited kind of 3D that we had for characters.</p>
<p>To make them turn there were literally</p>
<p>eight different views of them.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t actually have a 3D model that would rotate.</p>
<p>You just had these cardboard cutouts.</p>
<p>But that was good enough for that startle fight reaction</p>
<p>and it was kind of what we had to deal with there.</p>
<p>So a straightforward approach to do that</p>
<p>you could just write out your doubly nested loop</p>
<p>of you&rsquo;ve got your stretch factor</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve got a point,</p>
<p>you stretch by a little bit,</p>
<p>it might be on the same pixel,</p>
<p>it might be on the next pixel,</p>
<p>it might have skipped a pixel.</p>
<p>You can write that out but it&rsquo;s not gonna be fast enough</p>
<p>where especially you get a character for that</p>
<p>right in your face monster covering</p>
<p>almost the entire screen.</p>
<p>Doing that with a general purpose scaling routine</p>
<p>would have just been much too slow.</p>
<p>It would have worked when they&rsquo;re small characters</p>
<p>but then it would get slower and slower</p>
<p>as they got closer to you until right at the time</p>
<p>when you most care about having a fast reaction time,</p>
<p>the game would be chunking down.</p>
<p>So the fastest possible way to draw pixels at that time</p>
<p>was to, instead of saying I&rsquo;ve got a general purpose</p>
<p>version that can handle any scale,</p>
<p>I used a program to make essentially</p>
<p>a hundred or more separate little programs</p>
<p>that was optimized for I will take an image</p>
<p>and I will draw it 12 pixels tall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take an image, I&rsquo;ll draw it 14 pixels tall</p>
<p>up by every two pixels even for that.</p>
<p>So you would have the most optimized code</p>
<p>so that in the normal case</p>
<p>where most of the world is fairly large,</p>
<p>like the pixels are big,</p>
<p>we did not have a lot of memory.</p>
<p>So in most cases that meant that you would load</p>
<p>a pixel color and then you would store it multiple times.</p>
<p>So that was faster than even copying an image</p>
<p>in a normal conventional case</p>
<p>because most of the time the image is expanded.</p>
<p>So instead of doing one read, one write for a simple copy,</p>
<p>you might be doing one read and three or four writes</p>
<p>as it got really big.</p>
<p>And that had the beneficial aspect</p>
<p>of just when you needed the performance most</p>
<p>when things are covering the screen,</p>
<p>it was giving you the most acceleration for that.</p>
<p>By the way, were you able to understand this</p>
<p>through thinking about it or were you testing</p>
<p>like the right speed and like that?</p>
<p>This again comes back to, I can find the antecedents</p>
<p>for things like this.</p>
<p>So back in the Apple II days,</p>
<p>the graphics were essentially single bits at a time.</p>
<p>And if you wanted to make your little spaceship,</p>
<p>if you wanted to make it smoothly go across the world,</p>
<p>if you just took the image and you drew it out</p>
<p>at the next location, you would move by seven pixels</p>
<p>at a time, so it&rsquo;d go chunk, chunk, chunk.</p>
<p>If you wanted to make it move smoothly,</p>
<p>you actually had to make seven versions of the ship</p>
<p>that were pre shifted.</p>
<p>You could write a program that would shift it dynamically,</p>
<p>but on a one megahertz processor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going anywhere fast.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to do a smooth moving fast action game,</p>
<p>you made separate versions of each of these sprites.</p>
<p>Now there were a few more tricks you could pull</p>
<p>that if it still wasn&rsquo;t fast enough,</p>
<p>you could make a compiled shape</p>
<p>where instead of this program that normally copies an image</p>
<p>and says like, get this byte from here, stored here,</p>
<p>get this byte, store this byte.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the memory space, you could say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to write the program</p>
<p>that does nothing but draw this shape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to load the immediate value 25,</p>
<p>which is some bit pattern,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to store that at this location.</p>
<p>Rather than loading something from memory</p>
<p>that involved indexing registers and this other slow stuff,</p>
<p>you could go ahead and say,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m gonna hard code the exact values</p>
<p>of all of the image right into the program.</p>
<p>And this was always a horrible trade off there,</p>
<p>which you didn&rsquo;t have much memory</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t have much speed.</p>
<p>But if you had something that you wanted to go really fast,</p>
<p>you could turn it into a program.</p>
<p>And that was, knowing about that technique</p>
<p>is what made me think about some of these unwinding it</p>
<p>for the PC where people that didn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>from that background were less likely to think about that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some deep parallels</p>
<p>probably to human cognition as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about optimizing and compressing</p>
<p>the processing of a new information</p>
<p>that requires you to predict the possible ways</p>
<p>in which the game or the world might unroll.</p>
<p>And you have something like compiled scaler is always there.</p>
<p>So you have like, like you have a prediction</p>
<p>of how the world will unroll</p>
<p>and you have some kind of optimized data structure</p>
<p>for that prediction.</p>
<p>And then you can modify if the world turns out</p>
<p>to be different, you can modify a slight way.</p>
<p>And as far as building out techniques,</p>
<p>so much of the brain is about the associative context.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re just, when you learn something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the context of something else</p>
<p>and you can have faint, tiny little hints of things.</p>
<p>And I do think there are some deep things</p>
<p>around like sparse distributed memories and boosting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, if you can just be slightly</p>
<p>above the noise floor of having some hint of something,</p>
<p>you can have things refined into pulling the memory back up.</p>
<p>So having a, being a programmer and having a toolbox</p>
<p>of like all of these things that,</p>
<p>things that I did in all of these previous lives</p>
<p>of programming tasks that still matters to me</p>
<p>about how I&rsquo;m able to pull up some of these things.</p>
<p>Like in that case, it was something I did on the Apple 2</p>
<p>then being relevant for the PC.</p>
<p>And I have still cases when I would,</p>
<p>when I would work on mobile development then be like,</p>
<p>okay, I did something like this back in the doom days,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s a different environment,</p>
<p>but I have still had that tie.</p>
<p>I can bring it in and I can transform it</p>
<p>into what the world needs right now.</p>
<p>And I do think that&rsquo;s actually one of the very core things</p>
<p>with human cognition and brain like,</p>
<p>you know, brain like functioning</p>
<p>is finding these ways about you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, it is just a set of all of this stuff</p>
<p>that is just fetched back by these queries that go into it.</p>
<p>And they can just be slightly above the noise floor</p>
<p>with a random noise in your neurons and synapses</p>
<p>that are affecting exactly what gets pulled up.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying some of these very specific solutions</p>
<p>for different games,</p>
<p>you find that there&rsquo;s a kernel of a deep idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generalizable to other, to other things.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t predict what it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>but that idea of like,</p>
<p>I called out that compiled shaders in the forward</p>
<p>that I wrote for that, the game engine black book,</p>
<p>as you know, this is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an end point of unrolling code,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one of those things that thinking about that</p>
<p>and having that in your mind.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there are some programmers</p>
<p>that, you know, hear about that.</p>
<p>Think about it a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the mind blown moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, you can just turn all of that data into code.</p>
<p>And nowadays, you know, you have instruction cache issues</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not necessarily the best idea,</p>
<p>but there are different,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an idea that has power</p>
<p>and has probably relevance in some other areas.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s in a hardware point of view</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a way you approach building hardware</p>
<p>that has that same,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to think about iterating.</p>
<p>You just bake everything all the way into it in one place.</p>
<p>What is the story of how you came to program Doom?</p>
<p>What are some memorable technical challenges</p>
<p>or innovations within that game?</p>
<p>So the path that we went after Wolfenstein got out</p>
<p>and we were on this crazy arc</p>
<p>where Keen one through three, more success than we thought,</p>
<p>Keen four through six, even more success,</p>
<p>Wolfenstein even more success.</p>
<p>So we were on this crazy trajectory for things.</p>
<p>So actually our first box commercial project</p>
<p>was the Commander Keen game,</p>
<p>but then Wolfenstein was going to have a game called</p>
<p>Spear of Destiny, which was a commercial version,</p>
<p>60 new levels.</p>
<p>So the rest of the team took the game engine</p>
<p>pretty much as it was and started working on that.</p>
<p>We got new monsters,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically reskins of the things there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really interesting aspect about that</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t appreciate until much, much later</p>
<p>about how Wolfenstein clearly did tap out its limit</p>
<p>about what you want to play,</p>
<p>all the levels and a couple of our license things.</p>
<p>There was a hard creative wall</p>
<p>that you did not really benefit much</p>
<p>by continuing to beat on it.</p>
<p>But a game like Doom and other more modern games</p>
<p>like Minecraft or something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of a Turing completeness level</p>
<p>of design freedom that you get in games</p>
<p>that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one side of.</p>
<p>All the creative people in the world</p>
<p>could not go and do a masterpiece</p>
<p>just with the technology that Wolfenstein had.</p>
<p>Wolfenstein could do Wolfenstein,</p>
<p>but you really couldn&rsquo;t do something crazy and different.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t take that much more capability</p>
<p>to get to Wolfenstein with the freeform lines</p>
<p>and a little bit more artistic freedom</p>
<p>to get to the point where people still announce</p>
<p>new Doom levels today, all these years after</p>
<p>without having completely tapped out the creativity.</p>
<p>How did you put it?</p>
<p>Turing complete?</p>
<p>Yeah, Turing complete design space.</p>
<p>Design space.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>we have the kind of computational universality</p>
<p>on a lot of things and how different</p>
<p>subsurface work. For creativity.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s things where a box can be too small,</p>
<p>but above a certain point,</p>
<p>you kind of are at the point where you really have</p>
<p>almost unbounded creative ability there.</p>
<p>And Doom was the first time you crossed that line.</p>
<p>Yeah, where there were thousands of Doom levels created,</p>
<p>and some of them still have something new and interesting</p>
<p>to say to the world about it.</p>
<p>Is that line, can you introspect what that line was?</p>
<p>Is it in the design space?</p>
<p>Is it something about the programming capabilities</p>
<p>that you were able to add to the game?</p>
<p>So the graphics fidelity was a necessary part</p>
<p>because the block limitations in Wolfenstein,</p>
<p>what we had right there was not enough.</p>
<p>The full scale blocks, although Minecraft really did show</p>
<p>that perhaps blocks stacked in 3D</p>
<p>and at one quarter of the scale of that,</p>
<p>or one eighth in volume,</p>
<p>is then sufficient to have all of that.</p>
<p>But the wall sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein</p>
<p>was too much of a creative limitation.</p>
<p>We licensed the technology to a few other teams.</p>
<p>None of them made too much of a dent with that.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t enough creative ability.</p>
<p>But a little bit more,</p>
<p>whether it was the variable floors and ceilings</p>
<p>and arbitrary angles in Doom,</p>
<p>or the smaller voxel blocks in Minecraft,</p>
<p>is then enough to open it up</p>
<p>to just worlds and worlds of new capabilities.</p>
<p>What is binary space partitioning?</p>
<p>So the. Which is one of the technologies.</p>
<p>Yeah, so jump around a little bit on the story path there.</p>
<p>So while the team was working on Spirit Destiny</p>
<p>for Wolfenstein, we had met another development team,</p>
<p>Raven Software, while we were in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>And they were doing, they had RPG background</p>
<p>and I still kind of loved that.</p>
<p>And I offered to do a game engine for them</p>
<p>to let them do a 3D rendered RPG</p>
<p>instead of the, like most RPG games were kind of hand drawn.</p>
<p>They made it look kind of 3D,</p>
<p>but it was done just all with artist work</p>
<p>rather than a real engine.</p>
<p>And after Wolfenstein, this was still a tile based world,</p>
<p>but I added floors and ceilings and some lighting</p>
<p>and the ability to have some sloped floors</p>
<p>in different areas.</p>
<p>And that was my intermediate step</p>
<p>for a game called Shadowcaster.</p>
<p>And it had slowed down enough.</p>
<p>It was not fast enough to do our type of action things.</p>
<p>So they had the screen crop down a little bit.</p>
<p>So you couldn&rsquo;t go the full screen width</p>
<p>like we would try to do in Wolfenstein, but I learned a lot.</p>
<p>I got the floors and ceilings and lightings</p>
<p>and it looked great.</p>
<p>They were great artists up there.</p>
<p>And it was an inspiration for us</p>
<p>to look at some of that stuff.</p>
<p>But I had learned enough from that,</p>
<p>that I had the plan for,</p>
<p>I knew faster ways to do the lighting and shadowing.</p>
<p>And I wanted to do this free form geometry.</p>
<p>I wanted to break out of this tile based</p>
<p>90 degree world limitations.</p>
<p>So we had, that was when we got our next stations</p>
<p>and we were working with these higher powered systems.</p>
<p>And we built an editor that let us draw</p>
<p>kind of arbitrary line segments.</p>
<p>And I was working hard to try to make something</p>
<p>that could render this fast enough.</p>
<p>I was pushing myself pretty hard.</p>
<p>And we were at a point where we could see some things</p>
<p>that looked amazingly cool,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t really fast enough for the way I was doing it.</p>
<p>For this flexibility, it was no longer,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t just ray cast into it.</p>
<p>And I had these very complex sets of lines</p>
<p>and simple little worlds were okay.</p>
<p>But the cool things that we wanted to do</p>
<p>just weren&rsquo;t quite fast enough.</p>
<p>And I wound up taking a break at that point.</p>
<p>And I did the port.</p>
<p>I did two ports of our games,</p>
<p>Wolfenstein to the Super Nintendo.</p>
<p>It was a crazy difficult thing to do,</p>
<p>which was an even slower processors,</p>
<p>like a couple of megahertz processor.</p>
<p>And it had been this whole thing</p>
<p>where we had farmed out the work and it wasn&rsquo;t going well.</p>
<p>And I took it back over</p>
<p>and trying to make it go fast on there</p>
<p>where it really did not have much processing power.</p>
<p>The pixels were stretched up hugely</p>
<p>and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it.</p>
<p>But in the end, it did come out fast enough to play</p>
<p>and still be kind of fun from that.</p>
<p>But that was where I started using BSP trees</p>
<p>or binary space partitioning trees.</p>
<p>It was one of those things I had to make it faster there.</p>
<p>It was a stepping stone where it was reasonably easy</p>
<p>to understand in the grid world of Wolfenstein</p>
<p>where it was all still 90 degree angles.</p>
<p>BSP trees were, I eased myself into it with that.</p>
<p>And it was a big success.</p>
<p>Then when I came back to working on Doom,</p>
<p>I had this new tool in my toolbox.</p>
<p>It was gonna be a lot harder</p>
<p>with the arbitrary angles of Doom.</p>
<p>This was where I really started grappling</p>
<p>with epsilon problems.</p>
<p>And just up until that point,</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really had to deal with the fact</p>
<p>that I am so many numeric things.</p>
<p>This almost felt like a betrayal to me</p>
<p>where people had told me that I had mathematicians</p>
<p>up on a bit of a pedestal where I was,</p>
<p>people think I&rsquo;m a math wizard and I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I really, everything that I did was really done</p>
<p>with a solid high school math understanding.</p>
<p>Algebra two trigonometry and that was what got me</p>
<p>all the way through Doom and Quake and all of that,</p>
<p>of just understanding basics of matrices</p>
<p>and knowing it well enough to do something with it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the epsilon problems you ran into?</p>
<p>So when you wind up taking like a sloped line</p>
<p>and you say, I&rsquo;m going to intersect it</p>
<p>with another sloped line,</p>
<p>then you wind up with something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to be on these nice grid boundaries.</p>
<p>With the Wolfenstein tile maps,</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;ve got is horizontal and vertical lines</p>
<p>looking at it from above.</p>
<p>And if you cut one of them, it&rsquo;s just obvious</p>
<p>the other one gets cut exactly at that point.</p>
<p>But when you have angled lines,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a kind of a slope intercept problem</p>
<p>and you wind up with rational numbers there</p>
<p>where things that are not going to evenly land on an integer</p>
<p>or even on any fixed point value that you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>So everything winds up having to snap</p>
<p>to some fixed point value.</p>
<p>So the lines slightly change their angle.</p>
<p>You wind up, if you cut something here,</p>
<p>this one&rsquo;s going to bend a little this way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not going to be completely straight.</p>
<p>And then you come down to all these questions of,</p>
<p>well, this one is a point on an angled line.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t answer that in finite precision</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing something with actual rational numbers.</p>
<p>And later on, I did waste far too much time</p>
<p>chasing things like that.</p>
<p>How do you do precise arithmetic with rational numbers?</p>
<p>And it always blows up eventually, exponentially</p>
<p>as you do it.</p>
<p>So these kinds of things are impossible with computers.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re possible.</p>
<p>Again, there are paths to doing it,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t fit them conveniently</p>
<p>in any of the numbers.</p>
<p>You need to start using big nums</p>
<p>and different factor trackings of different things.</p>
<p>So you have to, if you have any elements of OCD</p>
<p>and you want to do something perfectly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re screwed if you&rsquo;re working with floating point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you had to deal with this for the first time.</p>
<p>And there were lots of challenges there about like,</p>
<p>okay, they build this cool thing.</p>
<p>And the way the BSP trees work is it basically</p>
<p>takes the walls and it carves other walls by those walls</p>
<p>in this clever way that you can then</p>
<p>take all of these fragments.</p>
<p>And then you can for sure, from any given point,</p>
<p>get an ordering of everything in the world.</p>
<p>And you can say, this goes in front of this,</p>
<p>goes in front of this, all the way back to the last thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s super valuable for graphics</p>
<p>where kind of a classic graphics algorithm</p>
<p>would be painter&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>
<p>You paint the furthest thing first,</p>
<p>and then the next thing, and then the next thing,</p>
<p>and then it comes up and it&rsquo;s all perfect for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s slow because you don&rsquo;t want to have to have drawn</p>
<p>everything like that,</p>
<p>but you can also flip it around</p>
<p>and draw the closest thing to you.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re clever about it,</p>
<p>you can figure out what you need to draw</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s visible beyond that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what BSP trees allow you to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s combined with a bunch of other things,</p>
<p>but it gives you that ordering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clever way of doing things.</p>
<p>And I remember I had learned this</p>
<p>from one of my graphics Bible at the time,</p>
<p>a book called Foley and Van Damme.</p>
<p>And again, it was a different world back there.</p>
<p>There was a small integer number of books.</p>
<p>And this book that was big fat college textbook</p>
<p>that I had read through many times.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand everything in it.</p>
<p>Some of it wasn&rsquo;t useful to me,</p>
<p>but they had the little thing about finite orderings</p>
<p>of you draw a little T shaped thing</p>
<p>and you can say you can make a fixed ahead of time order</p>
<p>from this and you can generalize this with the BSP trees.</p>
<p>And I got a little bit more information about that.</p>
<p>And it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake,</p>
<p>I got to meet Bruce Naylor,</p>
<p>who is one of the original researchers</p>
<p>that developed those technologies for academic literature.</p>
<p>And that was kind of fun,</p>
<p>but I was very much just finding a tool</p>
<p>that can help me solve what I was doing.</p>
<p>And I was using it in this very crude way</p>
<p>in a two dimensional fashion, rather than the general 3D.</p>
<p>The Epsilon problems got much worse</p>
<p>in Quake and three dimensionals</p>
<p>when things angle in every way.</p>
<p>But eventually I did sort out</p>
<p>how to do it reliably on Doom.</p>
<p>There were still a few edge cases in Doom</p>
<p>that were not absolutely perfect</p>
<p>where they even got terminologies in the communities.</p>
<p>Like when you got to something where it was messed up,</p>
<p>it was a hall of mirrors effect</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d sweep by and it wouldn&rsquo;t draw something there.</p>
<p>And you would just wind up with the leftover remnants</p>
<p>as you flipped between the two pages.</p>
<p>But BSP trees were important for it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s again worth noting that after we did Doom,</p>
<p>our major competition came from Ken Silverman</p>
<p>and his build engine, which was used for Duke Nukem 3D</p>
<p>and some of the other games for 3D Realms.</p>
<p>And he used a completely different technology,</p>
<p>nothing to do with BSP trees.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not just a one true way of doing things.</p>
<p>There were critical things about</p>
<p>to make any of those games fast.</p>
<p>You had to separate your drawing into,</p>
<p>you drew vertical lines and you drew horizontal lines,</p>
<p>just kind of changing exactly</p>
<p>what you would draw with them.</p>
<p>That was critical for the technologies at that time.</p>
<p>And like all the games that were kind of like that</p>
<p>wound up doing something similar,</p>
<p>but there were still a bunch of other decisions</p>
<p>that could be made.</p>
<p>And we made good enough decisions on everything on Doom.</p>
<p>We brought in multiplayer significantly</p>
<p>and it was our first game that was designed</p>
<p>to be modified by the user community</p>
<p>where we had this whole setup of our WAD files and PWADs</p>
<p>and things that people could build with tools</p>
<p>that we released to them.</p>
<p>And they eventually rewrote to be better</p>
<p>than what we released, but they could build things</p>
<p>and you could add it to your game</p>
<p>without destructively modifying it,</p>
<p>which is what you had to do in all the early games.</p>
<p>You literally hacked the data files or the executable</p>
<p>before while Doom was set up in this flexible way</p>
<p>so that you could just say,</p>
<p>run the normal game with this added on on top</p>
<p>and it would overlay just the things</p>
<p>that you wanted to there.</p>
<p>Would you say that Doom was kind of the first</p>
<p>true 3D game that you created?</p>
<p>So no, it&rsquo;s still, Doom would usually be called</p>
<p>a two and a half D game</p>
<p>where it had three dimensional points on it.</p>
<p>And this is another one of these kind of pedantic things</p>
<p>that people love to argue about,</p>
<p>about what was the first 3D game.</p>
<p>I still, like every month probably I hear from somebody</p>
<p>about, well, was Doom really a 3D game or something?</p>
<p>And I give the point where characters had three coordinates.</p>
<p>So you had like an X, Y and Z,</p>
<p>the cacodamon could be coming in very high</p>
<p>and come down towards you.</p>
<p>The walls had three coordinates on them.</p>
<p>So on some sense it&rsquo;s a 3D game engine,</p>
<p>but it was not a fully general 3D game engine.</p>
<p>You could not build a pyramid in Doom</p>
<p>because you couldn&rsquo;t make a sloped wall,</p>
<p>which was slightly different</p>
<p>where in that previous shadow caster game,</p>
<p>I could have vertexes and have a sloped floor there,</p>
<p>but the changes that I made for Doom to get higher speed</p>
<p>and a different set of flexibility traded away that ability,</p>
<p>but you literally couldn&rsquo;t make that.</p>
<p>You could not, you could make different heights of passages,</p>
<p>but you could not make a bridge over another area.</p>
<p>You could not go over and above it.</p>
<p>So it still had some 2D limitations to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more about the building</p>
<p>versus the actual experience.</p>
<p>Cause the experience is.</p>
<p>It felt like things would come at you,</p>
<p>but again, you couldn&rsquo;t look up either.</p>
<p>I am, you know, you could only pitch.</p>
<p>It was four degrees of freedom</p>
<p>rather than six degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>You did not have the ability to tilt your head this way</p>
<p>or pitch up and down.</p>
<p>So that takes us to Quake.</p>
<p>What was the leap there?</p>
<p>What was some fascinating technical challenges</p>
<p>and there were a lot or not challenges,</p>
<p>but innovations that you&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>
<p>So Quake was kind of the first thing</p>
<p>where I did have to kind of come face to face</p>
<p>with my limitations,</p>
<p>where it was the first thing</p>
<p>where I really did kind of give it my all</p>
<p>and still come up, you know, come up a little bit short</p>
<p>in terms of what and when I wanted to get it done.</p>
<p>And the company ran,</p>
<p>they had some serious stresses through the whole project</p>
<p>and we bit off a lot.</p>
<p>So the things that we set out to do</p>
<p>was it was going to be really a true 3D engine</p>
<p>where it could do six degree of freedom.</p>
<p>You could have all the viewpoints.</p>
<p>You could model anything.</p>
<p>It had a really remarkable new lighting model</p>
<p>with the surface caching and things.</p>
<p>That was one of those where it was starting</p>
<p>to do some things that they weren&rsquo;t doing</p>
<p>even on the very high end systems.</p>
<p>And it was going to be completely programmable</p>
<p>in the modding standpoint,</p>
<p>where the thing that you couldn&rsquo;t do in Doom,</p>
<p>you could replace almost all of the media,</p>
<p>but you couldn&rsquo;t really change the game.</p>
<p>There were still some people that were doing</p>
<p>the hex setting of the executable,</p>
<p>the dehacked things where you could change</p>
<p>a few things about rules</p>
<p>and people made some early capture the flag type things</p>
<p>by hacking the executable,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t really set out to do that.</p>
<p>Quake was going to have its own programming language</p>
<p>that the game was going to be implemented in it.</p>
<p>And that would be able to be overwritten</p>
<p>just like any of the media.</p>
<p>Code was going to be data for that.</p>
<p>And you would be able to have expansion packs</p>
<p>that changed fundamental things and mods and so on.</p>
<p>And the multiplayer was going to be playable</p>
<p>over the internet.</p>
<p>It was going to support a client server</p>
<p>rather than peer to peer.</p>
<p>So we had the possibility of supporting</p>
<p>larger numbers of players in disparate locations</p>
<p>with this full flexibility of the programming overrides</p>
<p>with full six degree of freedom modeling and viewing.</p>
<p>And with this fancy new light mapped</p>
<p>kind of surface caching side.</p>
<p>It was a lot.</p>
<p>And this was one of those things that</p>
<p>if I could go back and tell younger me</p>
<p>to do something differently,</p>
<p>it would have been to split those innovations up</p>
<p>into two phases in two separate games.</p>
<p>It will be phase one and phase two.</p>
<p>So it probably would have been taking</p>
<p>the Doom rendering engine and bringing in</p>
<p>the TCP IP client server.</p>
<p>Focusing on the multiplayer.</p>
<p>And the Quake C or would have been Doom C</p>
<p>programming language there.</p>
<p>So I would have split that into programming language</p>
<p>and networking with the same Doom engine</p>
<p>rather than forcing everybody to go towards</p>
<p>the Quake engine, which really meant getting a Pentium.</p>
<p>While it ran on a 486, it was not a great experience there.</p>
<p>We could have made more people happier</p>
<p>and gotten two games done in 50% more time.</p>
<p>So speaking of people happier, our mutual friend,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan, it seems like the most important moment</p>
<p>of his life is centered around Quake.</p>
<p>So it was a definitive part of his life.</p>
<p>So would he agree with your thinking that they should split?</p>
<p>So he is a person who loves Quake</p>
<p>and played Quake a lot.</p>
<p>Would he agree that you should have done the Doom engine</p>
<p>and focus on the multiplayer for phase one?</p>
<p>Or in your looking back, is the 3D world</p>
<p>that Quake created was also fundamental</p>
<p>to the enriching experience?</p>
<p>You know, I would say that what would have happened</p>
<p>is you would have had a Doom looking</p>
<p>but Quake feeling game eight months earlier</p>
<p>and then maybe six months after Quake actually shipped,</p>
<p>then there would have been the full running on a Pentium,</p>
<p>six degree of freedom graphics engine type things there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that it wouldn&rsquo;t have been there.</p>
<p>It would have been something amazingly cool earlier</p>
<p>and then something even cooler somewhat later</p>
<p>where I would much rather have gone</p>
<p>and done two one year development efforts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve cycled them through.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a little more pragmatic about that</p>
<p>rather than killing us ourselves on the whole Quake</p>
<p>development.</p>
<p>But I would say it&rsquo;s obviously things worked out well</p>
<p>in the end, but looking back and saying,</p>
<p>how would I optimize and do things differently?</p>
<p>That did seem to be a clear case where I going ahead</p>
<p>and we had enormous momentum on Doom.</p>
<p>We did Doom two as the kind of commercial boxed version</p>
<p>after our shareware success with the original,</p>
<p>but we could have just made another Doom game</p>
<p>adding those new features in.</p>
<p>It would have been huge.</p>
<p>We would have learned all the same lessons, but faster.</p>
<p>And it would have given six degree of freedom</p>
<p>and Pentium class systems a little bit more time</p>
<p>to get mainstream because we did cut out a lot of people</p>
<p>with the hardware requirements for Quake.</p>
<p>Was there any dark moments for you personally,</p>
<p>psychologically in having such harsh deadlines</p>
<p>and having to solve so many difficult technical challenges?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never really had really dark black places.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t necessarily put myself</p>
<p>in anyone else&rsquo;s shoes,</p>
<p>but I understand a lot of people have significant challenges</p>
<p>with kind of their mental health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been super stressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been unhappy as a teenager in various ways,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never really gone to a very dark place.</p>
<p>I just seem to be largely immune to what really wrecks people.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of time when I&rsquo;m very unhappy</p>
<p>and miserable about something,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s never hit me like,</p>
<p>I believe it winds up hitting some other people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve borne up well under whatever stresses</p>
<p>have kind of fallen on me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always coped best on that</p>
<p>when all I need to do is usually</p>
<p>just kind of bear down on my work.</p>
<p>I pull myself out of whatever hole I might be slipping into</p>
<p>by actually making progress.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe if I was in a position</p>
<p>where I was never able to make that progress,</p>
<p>I could have slid down further,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always been in a place where,</p>
<p>okay, a little bit more work,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m in a tough spot here,</p>
<p>but I always know if I just keep pushing,</p>
<p>eventually I break through and I make progress,</p>
<p>I feel good about what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been enough for me so far in my life.</p>
<p>Have you seen it in the distance,</p>
<p>like ideas of depression or contemplating suicide?</p>
<p>Have you seen those things far?</p>
<p>So what was interesting, when I was a teenager,</p>
<p>I was probably on some level a troubled youth.</p>
<p>I was unhappy most of my teenage years.</p>
<p>I really, I wanted to be on my own</p>
<p>doing programming all the time.</p>
<p>As soon as I was 18, 19, even though I was poor,</p>
<p>I was doing exactly what I wanted and I was very happy,</p>
<p>but high school was not a great time for me.</p>
<p>And I had a conversation with like the school counselor</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of running their script.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, it&rsquo;s kind of a weird kid here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s carefully probe around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, do you ever think about ending it all?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, of course not.</p>
<p>Never, not at all.</p>
<p>This is temporary, things are going to be better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always been kind of the case for me.</p>
<p>And obviously that&rsquo;s not that way for everyone</p>
<p>and other people do react differently.</p>
<p>What was your escape from the troubled youth,</p>
<p>like music, video games, books?</p>
<p>How did you escape from a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s full of cruelty and suffering and that&rsquo;s absurd?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I was not a victim of cruelty and suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I was an unhappy, somewhat petulant youth</p>
<p>in my point where I&rsquo;m not putting myself up</p>
<p>with anybody else&rsquo;s suffering,</p>
<p>but I was unhappy objectively.</p>
<p>And the things that I did</p>
<p>that very much characterized my childhood</p>
<p>were I had books, comic books,</p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games, video games.</p>
<p>Like some of my fondest childhood memories</p>
<p>are the convenience stores, the 711s and Quick Trips,</p>
<p>because they had a spinner rack of comic books</p>
<p>and they had a little side room</p>
<p>with two or three video games, arcade games in it.</p>
<p>And that was very much my happy place.</p>
<p>If I could, I get my comic books</p>
<p>and if I could go to a library</p>
<p>and go through those little zero, zero, zero section</p>
<p>where computer books were supposed to be.</p>
<p>And there were a few sad little books there,</p>
<p>but still just being able to sit down and go through that.</p>
<p>And I read a ridiculous number of books,</p>
<p>both fiction and nonfiction as a teenager.</p>
<p>And my rebelling in high school</p>
<p>was just sitting there with my nose in a book,</p>
<p>ignoring the class through lots of it.</p>
<p>And teachers had a range of reactions to that,</p>
<p>some more accepting of it than others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you on that.</p>
<p>So let us return to Quake for a bit</p>
<p>with the technical challenges.</p>
<p>What everything together from the networking</p>
<p>to the graphics, what are some things you remember</p>
<p>that were innovations you had to come up with</p>
<p>in order to make it all happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there were a bunch of things on Quake</p>
<p>where on the one hand,</p>
<p>the idea that I built my own programming language</p>
<p>to implement the game in.</p>
<p>Looking back, and I try to tell people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like every high level programmer</p>
<p>sometime in their career goes through</p>
<p>and they invent their own language.</p>
<p>It just seems to be a thing that&rsquo;s pretty broadly done.</p>
<p>People will be like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go write a computer programming language.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t regret having done it,</p>
<p>but after that, I switched from Quake C,</p>
<p>my quirky little pseudo object oriented</p>
<p>or entity oriented language there.</p>
<p>Quake two went back to using DLLs with C</p>
<p>and then Quake three,</p>
<p>I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler,</p>
<p>which was a much smarter thing to do</p>
<p>that I should have done originally for Quake.</p>
<p>But building my own language was an experience.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from that.</p>
<p>And then there was a generation of game programmers</p>
<p>that learned programming with Quake C,</p>
<p>which I feel kind of bad about,</p>
<p>because we give JavaScript a lot of crap,</p>
<p>but Quake C was nothing to write home about there.</p>
<p>But it allowed people to do magical things.</p>
<p>You get into programming,</p>
<p>not because you love the BNF syntax of a language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because the language lets you do something</p>
<p>that you cared about.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s very much,</p>
<p>you could do something</p>
<p>in a whole beautiful three dimensional world.</p>
<p>And the idea and the fact that the code</p>
<p>for the game was out there,</p>
<p>you could say, I liked the shotgun,</p>
<p>but I want it to be more bad ass.</p>
<p>You go in there and say,</p>
<p>okay, now it does 200 points damage.</p>
<p>And then you go around with a big grin on your face,</p>
<p>blowing up monsters all over the game.</p>
<p>So yeah, it is not what I would do today</p>
<p>going back with that language,</p>
<p>but that was a big part of it.</p>
<p>Learning about the networking stuff,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s interesting where I learned these things</p>
<p>by reading books.</p>
<p>So I would get a book on networking and find something,</p>
<p>I read all about it and learn, okay, packets,</p>
<p>they can be out of order or lost or duplicated.</p>
<p>These are all the things</p>
<p>that can theoretically happen to packets.</p>
<p>So I wind up spending all this time thinking about</p>
<p>how do we deal about all of that?</p>
<p>And it turns out, of course, in the real world,</p>
<p>those are things that yes,</p>
<p>theoretically can happen with multiple routes,</p>
<p>but they really aren&rsquo;t things that your 99.999%</p>
<p>of your packets have to deal with.</p>
<p>So there was learning experiences about lots of that.</p>
<p>Like why, when TCP is appropriate versus UDP</p>
<p>and how if you do things in UDP,</p>
<p>you wind up reinventing TCP badly in almost all cases.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s good arguments for using both</p>
<p>for different game technology,</p>
<p>different parts of the game process,</p>
<p>transitioning from level to level and all.</p>
<p>But the graphics were the showcase</p>
<p>of what Quake was all about.</p>
<p>It was this graphics technology that nobody had seen there.</p>
<p>And it was a while before</p>
<p>there were competitive things out there.</p>
<p>And it went a long time internally really not working</p>
<p>where we were even building levels</p>
<p>where the game just was not at all shippable</p>
<p>with large fractions of the world,</p>
<p>like disappearing, not being there,</p>
<p>or being really slow in various parts of it.</p>
<p>And it was this act of faith.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think I&rsquo;m gonna be able to fix this.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna be able to make this work.</p>
<p>And lots of stuff changed</p>
<p>where the level designers would build something</p>
<p>and then have to throw it away as something fundamental</p>
<p>and the kind of graphics or level technology changed.</p>
<p>And so there were two big things</p>
<p>that contributed to making it possible at that timeframe.</p>
<p>Two new things.</p>
<p>There was certainly</p>
<p>hardcore optimized low level assembly language.</p>
<p>And this was where I had hired Michael Abrash</p>
<p>away from Microsoft.</p>
<p>And he had been one of my early inspirations</p>
<p>where back in the soft disk days,</p>
<p>the library of magazines that they had,</p>
<p>some of my most treasured ones</p>
<p>were Michael Abrash&rsquo;s articles in Dr. Dobbs journal.</p>
<p>And it was amazing after all of our success in Doom,</p>
<p>we were able to kind of hit him up and say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;d like you to come work at id Software.</p>
<p>And he was in the senior technical role at Microsoft.</p>
<p>And he was on track for,</p>
<p>and this was right when Microsoft was starting to take off.</p>
<p>And I did eventually convince him</p>
<p>that what we were doing</p>
<p>was gonna be really amazing with Quake.</p>
<p>It was gonna be something nobody had seen before.</p>
<p>It had these aspects of what we were talking about.</p>
<p>We had metaverse talk back then.</p>
<p>We had read Snow Crash and we knew about this.</p>
<p>And Michael was big into the science fiction</p>
<p>and we would talk about all that</p>
<p>and kind of spin this tale.</p>
<p>And it was some of the same conversations</p>
<p>that we have today about the metaverse,</p>
<p>about how you could have different areas</p>
<p>linked together by portals</p>
<p>and you could have user generated content</p>
<p>and changing out all of these things.</p>
<p>So you really were creating the metaverse with Quake.</p>
<p>And we talked about things like,</p>
<p>Duke used to be advertised as a virtual reality experience.</p>
<p>That was the first wave of virtual reality</p>
<p>was in the late 80s and early 90s,</p>
<p>you had like the Lawn Mower Man movie</p>
<p>and you had time in Newsweek</p>
<p>talking about the early VPL headsets.</p>
<p>And of course that cratered so hard</p>
<p>that people didn&rsquo;t wanna look at virtual reality</p>
<p>for decades afterwards,</p>
<p>where it was just, it was smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>It was not real in the sense</p>
<p>that you could actually do something</p>
<p>real and valuable with it.</p>
<p>But still we had that kind of common set of talking points.</p>
<p>And we were talking about what these games could become</p>
<p>and how you&rsquo;d like to see people</p>
<p>building all of these creative things.</p>
<p>Because we were seeing an explosion of work</p>
<p>with Doom at that time,</p>
<p>where people were doing amazingly cool things.</p>
<p>Like we saw cooler levels that we had built</p>
<p>coming out of the user community.</p>
<p>And then people finding ways</p>
<p>to change the characters in different ways.</p>
<p>And it was great.</p>
<p>And we knew what we were doing in Quake</p>
<p>was removing those last things.</p>
<p>There was some quirky things</p>
<p>with a couple of the data types</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t work right for overriding.</p>
<p>And then the core thing about the programming model.</p>
<p>And I was definitely going to hit all of those in Quake.</p>
<p>But the graphics side of it was still,</p>
<p>I knew what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And it was one of these hubris things</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, well, so far I&rsquo;ve been able</p>
<p>to kind of kick everything that I set out to go do.</p>
<p>But Quake was definitely a little bit more</p>
<p>than could be comfortably chewed at that point.</p>
<p>And, but Michael was one of the strongest programmers</p>
<p>and graphics programmers that I knew.</p>
<p>And he was one of the people that I trusted</p>
<p>to write assembly code better than I could.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few people that I can point to</p>
<p>about things like this where I&rsquo;m a world class optimizer.</p>
<p>I mean, I make things go fast,</p>
<p>but I recognize there&rsquo;s a number of people</p>
<p>that can write tighter assembly code,</p>
<p>tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code</p>
<p>than I can write.</p>
<p>My best strengths are a little bit more at the system level.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m good at all of that,</p>
<p>but the most leverage comes from making the decisions</p>
<p>that are a little bit higher up</p>
<p>where you figure out how to change your large scale problems</p>
<p>so that these lower level problems are easier to do</p>
<p>or it makes it possible to do them in a uniquely fast way.</p>
<p>So most of my big wins in a lot of ways</p>
<p>from all the way from the early games through VR</p>
<p>and the aerospace work that I&rsquo;m doing or did,</p>
<p>and hopefully the AI work that I&rsquo;m working on now</p>
<p>is finding an angle on something</p>
<p>that means you trade off something</p>
<p>that you maybe think you need,</p>
<p>but it turns out you don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>And by making a sacrifice in one place,</p>
<p>you can get big advantages in another place.</p>
<p>Is it clear at which level of the system</p>
<p>those big advantages can be gained?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always clear.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the thing that I try</p>
<p>to make one of my core values,</p>
<p>and I proselytize to a lot of people</p>
<p>is trying to know the entire stack,</p>
<p>trying to see through everything that happens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>on like the web browser level of things</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s so many levels to it,</p>
<p>but you should at least understand what they all are,</p>
<p>even if you can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>all the performance characteristics at each level,</p>
<p>but it goes all the way down to literally the hardware.</p>
<p>So what is this chip capable of?</p>
<p>And what is this software that you&rsquo;re writing capable of?</p>
<p>And then with this architecture you put on top of that,</p>
<p>then the ecosystem around it,</p>
<p>all the people that are working on it.</p>
<p>So there are all these decisions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re never made in a globally optimal way,</p>
<p>but sometimes you can drive a thread</p>
<p>of global optimality through it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t look at everything, it&rsquo;s too complicated,</p>
<p>but sometimes you can step back up</p>
<p>and make a different decision.</p>
<p>And we kind of went through this on the graphic side</p>
<p>on Quake, where in some ways it was kind of bad</p>
<p>where Michael would spend his time writing,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;d rough out the basic routines,</p>
<p>like, okay, here&rsquo;s our span rasterizer.</p>
<p>And he would spend a month writing</p>
<p>this beautiful cycle optimized piece of assembly language</p>
<p>that does what I asked it to do.</p>
<p>And he did it faster than like my original code would do,</p>
<p>or probably what I would be able to do</p>
<p>even if I had spent that month on it.</p>
<p>But then we&rsquo;d have some cases when I&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>okay, well, I figured out at this higher level</p>
<p>instead of drawing these in a painter&rsquo;s order here,</p>
<p>I do a span buffer and it cuts out 30% or 40%</p>
<p>of all of these pixels,</p>
<p>but it means you need to rewrite kind of this interface</p>
<p>of all of that.</p>
<p>And I could tell that wore on him a little bit,</p>
<p>but in the end it was the right thing to do</p>
<p>where we wound up changing that rasterization approach</p>
<p>and we wound up with a super optimized</p>
<p>assembly language core loop</p>
<p>and then a good system around it</p>
<p>which minimized how much that had to be called.</p>
<p>And so in order to be able to do</p>
<p>this kind of system level thinking,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about game development,</p>
<p>aerospace, nuclear energy, AI, VR,</p>
<p>you have to be able to understand the hardware,</p>
<p>the low level software, the high level software,</p>
<p>the design decisions, the whole thing,</p>
<p>the full stack of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s where a lot of these things</p>
<p>become possible.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re really, when you&rsquo;re bringing the future forward,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a pace that everything</p>
<p>just kind of glides towards</p>
<p>where we have a lot of progress</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening at such a different,</p>
<p>so many different ways you kind of slide towards progress</p>
<p>just left to your own, programs just get faster.</p>
<p>For a while it wasn&rsquo;t clear</p>
<p>if they were gonna get fatter more than they get,</p>
<p>quicker than they get faster and it cancels out,</p>
<p>but it is clear now in retrospect,</p>
<p>no, programs just get faster</p>
<p>and have gotten faster for a long time.</p>
<p>But if you wanna do something</p>
<p>like back at that original talking about scrolling games,</p>
<p>say what, this needs to be five times faster.</p>
<p>Well, we can wait six years</p>
<p>and just it&rsquo;ll naturally get that much faster at that time</p>
<p>or you come up with some really clever way of doing it.</p>
<p>So there are those opportunities like that</p>
<p>in a whole bunch of different areas.</p>
<p>Now, most programmers don&rsquo;t need to be thinking about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that many,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunities for this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not everyone&rsquo;s work a day type stuff.</p>
<p>So everyone doesn&rsquo;t have to know how all these things work.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to know how their compiler works,</p>
<p>how the processor chip manages cache eviction</p>
<p>and all these low level things.</p>
<p>But sometimes there are powerful opportunities</p>
<p>that you can look at and say,</p>
<p>we can bring the future five years faster.</p>
<p>We can do something that,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we could do this?</p>
<p>Well, we can do it today</p>
<p>if we make a certain set of decisions.</p>
<p>And it is in some ways smoke and mirrors</p>
<p>where you say it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Doom was a lot of smoke and mirrors</p>
<p>where people thought it was more capable</p>
<p>than it actually was,</p>
<p>but we picked the right smoke and mirrors</p>
<p>to deploy in the game where by doing this,</p>
<p>people will think that it&rsquo;s more general.</p>
<p>We are gonna amaze them with what they&rsquo;ve got here</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t notice</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t do these other things.</p>
<p>So smart decision making at that point,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where that kind of global holistic top down view</p>
<p>can work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really a strong believer</p>
<p>that technology should be sitting at that table</p>
<p>having those discussions</p>
<p>because you do have cases where you say,</p>
<p>well, you wanna be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a pure design solution.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in some cases now</p>
<p>where you truly have almost infinite resources.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re trying to do a scrolling game on the PC now,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to talk to a technology person.</p>
<p>You can just have,</p>
<p>any intern can make that go run as fast as it needs to there</p>
<p>and it can be completely design based.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re trying to do something that&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>either that can&rsquo;t be done for resources</p>
<p>like VR on a mobile chip set,</p>
<p>or that we don&rsquo;t even know how to do yet,</p>
<p>like artificial general intelligence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably going to be a matter</p>
<p>of coming at it from an angle.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, for AGI,</p>
<p>we have some of like what are some of the hudder principles</p>
<p>about how you can AXI or some of the,</p>
<p>there are theoretical ways that you can say,</p>
<p>this is the optimal learning algorithm</p>
<p>that can solve everything, but it&rsquo;s completely impractical.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So clearly you have to make some concessions</p>
<p>for general intelligence</p>
<p>and nobody knows what the right ones are yet.</p>
<p>So people are taking different angles of attack.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve got something clever</p>
<p>to come up with in that space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been surprising to me.</p>
<p>And I think perhaps it is a principle of progress</p>
<p>that smoke and mirrors somehow</p>
<p>is the way you build the future.</p>
<p>You kind of fake it till you make it</p>
<p>and you almost always make it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to be the way we achieve AGI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the way we build consciousness</p>
<p>into our machines.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s philosophers debate about the Turing test</p>
<p>is essentially about faking it till you make it.</p>
<p>You start by faking it.</p>
<p>And I think that always leads to making it</p>
<p>because if we look at history.</p>
<p>Arguments when, as soon as people start talking about</p>
<p>qualia and consciousness and Chinese rooms and things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I just check out.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any value in those conversations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, go ahead, tell me it&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do my best to try to make it work anyways.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you work with legged robots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of these.</p>
<p>They sure as heck make me feel like they&rsquo;re cautious</p>
<p>in a certain way that&rsquo;s not here today,</p>
<p>but is you could see the kernel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the flame, the beginnings of a flame.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have line of sight,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s glimmerings of light in the distance</p>
<p>for all of these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m hearing murmuring in a distant room.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you a human question here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve in the game design space,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done a lot of incredible work throughout,</p>
<p>but in terms of game design, you have changed the world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few people around you that did the same.</p>
<p>So famously there&rsquo;s some animosity, there&rsquo;s much love,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some animosity between you and John Romero.</p>
<p>What is at the core of that animosity and human tension?</p>
<p>So there really hasn&rsquo;t been for a long time.</p>
<p>And even at the beginning, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yes, I did push Romero out of the company.</p>
<p>And this is one of the things that I look back,</p>
<p>if I could go back telling my younger self</p>
<p>some advice about things,</p>
<p>the original founding kind of corporate structure</p>
<p>of id Software really led to a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>We started off with us as equal partners</p>
<p>and we had a buy sell agreement</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t want outsiders</p>
<p>to be telling us what to do inside the company.</p>
<p>And that did lead to a bunch of the problems</p>
<p>where I was sitting here going,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, all right, I&rsquo;m working harder than anyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing these technologies, nobody&rsquo;s done before,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all equal partners.</p>
<p>And then I see somebody that&rsquo;s not working as hard.</p>
<p>And I mean, I can&rsquo;t say I was the most mature about that.</p>
<p>I was 20 something years old</p>
<p>and it did bother me when I&rsquo;m like, everybody,</p>
<p>okay, we need to all pull together</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done it before everybody.</p>
<p>We know we can do this if we get together</p>
<p>and we grind it all out,</p>
<p>but not everybody wanted to do that for all time.</p>
<p>And I was the youngest one of the crowd there.</p>
<p>I had different sets of kind of backgrounds and motivations</p>
<p>and left at that point where it was, all right,</p>
<p>either everybody has to be contributing like up to this level</p>
<p>or they need to get pushed out was not,</p>
<p>that was not a great situation.</p>
<p>And I look back on it and know that we pushed people</p>
<p>out of the company that could have contributed</p>
<p>if there was a different framework for them.</p>
<p>And the modern kind of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>like let your stock vest over a time period</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s non voting stock</p>
<p>and all those different things.</p>
<p>We knew nothing about any of that.</p>
<p>I mean, we didn&rsquo;t know what we were doing</p>
<p>in terms of corporate structure or anything.</p>
<p>So if you think the framework was different,</p>
<p>some of the human tension could have been a little bit.</p>
<p>It almost certainly would have.</p>
<p>I mean, I look back at that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like even trying to summon up in my mind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I know I was really, really angry about,</p>
<p>like Romero not working as hard as I wanted him to work</p>
<p>or not carrying his load on the design for Quake</p>
<p>and coming up with things there.</p>
<p>But he was definitely doing things.</p>
<p>He made some of the best levels there.</p>
<p>He was working with some of our external teams</p>
<p>like Raven on the licensing side of things,</p>
<p>but there were differences of opinion about it,</p>
<p>but he landed right on his feet.</p>
<p>He went and he got $20 million from Eidos</p>
<p>to go do Ion Storm and he got to do things his way</p>
<p>and spun up three teams simultaneously</p>
<p>because that was always one of the challenging things</p>
<p>in it where we were doing these single string,</p>
<p>one project after another.</p>
<p>And I think some of them wanted to grow the company more</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t because I knew people that were saying that,</p>
<p>oh, companies turn to shit when you got 50 employees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a different world there.</p>
<p>And I loved our little dozen people working on the projects,</p>
<p>but you can look at it and say,</p>
<p>well, business realities matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re super successful here</p>
<p>and we could take a swing and a miss on something,</p>
<p>but you do it a couple of times and you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason companies try to have multiple teams</p>
<p>running at one time.</p>
<p>And so that was, again,</p>
<p>something I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate back then.</p>
<p>So if you look past all that,</p>
<p>you did create some amazing things together.</p>
<p>What did you love about John Romero?</p>
<p>What did you respect and appreciate about him?</p>
<p>What did you admire about him?</p>
<p>What did you learn from him?</p>
<p>When I met him, he was the coolest programmer</p>
<p>I had ever met.</p>
<p>He had done all of this stuff.</p>
<p>He had made all of these games.</p>
<p>He had worked at one of the companies</p>
<p>that I thought was the coolest at Origin Systems.</p>
<p>And he knew all this stuff.</p>
<p>He made things happen fast.</p>
<p>And he was also kind of a polymath about this</p>
<p>where he could do, he drew his own art.</p>
<p>He made his own levels,</p>
<p>as well as we worked on sound design systems</p>
<p>on top of actually being a really good programmer.</p>
<p>And we went through a little,</p>
<p>it was kind of fun where one of the early things</p>
<p>that we did where there was kind of the young buck bit</p>
<p>going in where I was the new guy.</p>
<p>And he was the top man programmer at the soft disk area.</p>
<p>And eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend</p>
<p>that we were gonna like race to implement this game,</p>
<p>to port one of our PC games back down to the Apple II.</p>
<p>And that was where we finally kind of became clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, Carmack stands a little bit apart</p>
<p>on the programming side of things.</p>
<p>But Romero then very gracefully moved into,</p>
<p>well, he&rsquo;ll work on the tools, he&rsquo;ll work on the systems,</p>
<p>do some of the game design stuff,</p>
<p>as well as contributing on,</p>
<p>starting to lead the design aspects of a lot of things.</p>
<p>So he was enormously valuable in the early stuff.</p>
<p>And so much of Doom and even Quake have his stamp on it</p>
<p>in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t at the same level of focus</p>
<p>that I brought to the work that we were doing there.</p>
<p>And he really did, we hit such a degree of success</p>
<p>that it was all in the press about that.</p>
<p>The rockstar game programmers.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the Beatles problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he ate it up and he did personify.</p>
<p>There was the whole game developers with Ferraris</p>
<p>that we had there.</p>
<p>And I thought that led to some challenges there.</p>
<p>But so much of the stuff that was great in the games</p>
<p>did come from him.</p>
<p>And I would certainly not take that away from him.</p>
<p>And even after we parted ways and he took his swing</p>
<p>with Eidos, in some ways, he was ahead of the curve</p>
<p>with mobile gaming as well, where</p>
<p>one of his companies after Eidos was working on feature phone</p>
<p>game development.</p>
<p>And I wound up doing some of that</p>
<p>just before the iPhone crossing over into the iPhone phase</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And that was something that clearly</p>
<p>did turn out to be a huge thing, although he</p>
<p>was too early for what he was working on at that time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had pretty cordial relationships</p>
<p>where I was happy to talk with him any time I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>run into him at a conference.</p>
<p>I have actually had some other people just say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, you shouldn&rsquo;t go over there</p>
<p>and give him the time of day.</p>
<p>Or felt that Masters of Doom played things up in a way</p>
<p>that I shouldn&rsquo;t be too happy with.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m OK with all of that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve still got love in your heart.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I just talked with him like last year,</p>
<p>or I guess it was even this year,</p>
<p>about mentioning that I&rsquo;m going off doing this AI stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going big into artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And he had a bunch of ideas for how</p>
<p>AI is going to play into gaming.</p>
<p>And asked if I was interested in collaborating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not in line with what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>But I do wish almost everyone the best.</p>
<p>I mean, I know I may not have partnered</p>
<p>on the best of terms with some people.</p>
<p>But I was thrilled to see Tom Hall writing VR games now.</p>
<p>He wrote, I&rsquo;m working on a game called Demio, which</p>
<p>is really an awesome VR game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>We all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together.</p>
<p>That was one of the things.</p>
<p>That was what we did on Sundays in the early days.</p>
<p>I would Dungeon Master, and they&rsquo;d all play.</p>
<p>And so it really made me smile seeing</p>
<p>Tom involved with an RPG game in virtual reality.</p>
<p>You were the CTO of Oculus VR since 2013,</p>
<p>and maybe less than a year involved in a bit in 2019.</p>
<p>Oculus was acquired by Facebook Now Meta in 2014.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken brilliantly about both the low level details,</p>
<p>the experimental design, and the big picture</p>
<p>vision of virtual reality.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the metaverse, the big question</p>
<p>here, both philosophically and technically.</p>
<p>How hard is it to build the metaverse?</p>
<p>What is the metaverse in your view?</p>
<p>You started with discussing and thinking about Quake</p>
<p>as a kind of a metaverse.</p>
<p>As you think about it today, what is the metaverse,</p>
<p>the thing that could create this compelling user value,</p>
<p>this experience that will change the world,</p>
<p>and how hard is it to build it?</p>
<p>So the term comes from Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s book Snow Crash,</p>
<p>which many of us had read back in the 90s.</p>
<p>It was one of those kind of formative books.</p>
<p>And there was this sense that the possibilities</p>
<p>and kind of the freedom and unlimited capabilities</p>
<p>to build a virtual world that does whatever you want,</p>
<p>whatever you ask of it, has been a powerful draw</p>
<p>for generations of developers, game developers specifically,</p>
<p>and people that are thinking about more general purpose</p>
<p>applications.</p>
<p>So we were talking about that back in the Doom and Quake days</p>
<p>about how do you wind up with an interconnected set of worlds</p>
<p>that you kind of visit from one to another.</p>
<p>And as web pages were becoming a thing,</p>
<p>you start thinking about what is the interactive kind</p>
<p>of 3D based equivalent of this.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of really bad takes.</p>
<p>You had like Vermol and virtual reality markup languages.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s aspects like that that came from people saying,</p>
<p>well, what kind of capabilities should we</p>
<p>develop to enable this?</p>
<p>And that kind of capability first work</p>
<p>has usually not panned out very well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have successful games</p>
<p>that started with things like Doom and Quake and communities</p>
<p>that formed around those, whether it</p>
<p>was server lists in the early days</p>
<p>or literal portaling between different games,</p>
<p>and then modern things that are on completely different order</p>
<p>of magnitude like Minecraft and Fortnite that</p>
<p>have 100 million plus users.</p>
<p>I still think that that&rsquo;s the right way</p>
<p>to go to build the metaverse is you build something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing that people love and people wind up</p>
<p>spending all their time in because it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And you expand the capabilities of that.</p>
<p>So even if it&rsquo;s a very basic experience, if it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Minecraft is an amazing case study in so many things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basic as it gets.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been able to be done with that is really enlightening.</p>
<p>And there are other cases where, like right now,</p>
<p>Roblox is basically a game construction kit aimed at kids.</p>
<p>And that was a capability first play.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s achieving scale that&rsquo;s on the same order</p>
<p>of those things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not impossible, but my preferred bet</p>
<p>would be you make something amazing that people love</p>
<p>and you make it better and better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I could say we could have gone back</p>
<p>and followed a path like that in the early days</p>
<p>if you just take the same game, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when Activision demonstrated that you could make</p>
<p>Call of Duty every year.</p>
<p>And not only is it not bad, people love it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very profitable.</p>
<p>The idea that you could have taken something like that,</p>
<p>take a great game, release a new version every year</p>
<p>that lets the capabilities grow and expand</p>
<p>to start saying it&rsquo;s like, OK, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a game about running around and shooting things,</p>
<p>but now you can bring your media into it.</p>
<p>You can add persistence of social signs of life</p>
<p>or whatever you want to add to it.</p>
<p>I still think that&rsquo;s quite a good position to take.</p>
<p>And I think that while Meta is doing a bottoms up capability</p>
<p>approach with Horizon Worlds where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fairly general purpose, creators</p>
<p>can build whatever they want in their sort of thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to compare and compete with something</p>
<p>like Fortnite, which also has enormous amounts of creativity</p>
<p>even though it was not designed originally</p>
<p>as a general purpose sort of thing.</p>
<p>So we have examples on both sides.</p>
<p>Me personally, I would have bet on trying</p>
<p>to do entertainment, valuable destination first,</p>
<p>and expanding from there.</p>
<p>So can you imagine the thing that will be kind of,</p>
<p>if we look back a couple of centuries from now</p>
<p>and you think about the experiences that</p>
<p>marked the singularity, the transition where most</p>
<p>of our world moved into virtual reality,</p>
<p>what do you think those experiences will look like?</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s going to be kind of like the way the web</p>
<p>slowly took over, where you&rsquo;re the frog</p>
<p>in the pot of water that&rsquo;s slowly heating up,</p>
<p>where having lived through all of that,</p>
<p>I remember when it was shocking to start</p>
<p>seeing the first website address on a billboard when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, hey, my computer world is infecting the real world.</p>
<p>This is spreading out in some way.</p>
<p>But when you look back and say, well,</p>
<p>what made the web take off?</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a big bang sort of moment there.</p>
<p>It was a bunch of little things that turned out</p>
<p>not to even be the things that are relevant now</p>
<p>that brought them into it.</p>
<p>So I wonder if, I mean, like you said, you&rsquo;re not a historian.</p>
<p>So maybe there is a historian out there</p>
<p>that could really identify that moment, data driven way.</p>
<p>It could be like MySpace or something like that.</p>
<p>Maybe the first major social network that really reached</p>
<p>into non geek world or something like that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of the fallacy of historians, though,</p>
<p>looking for some of those kind of primary dominant causes</p>
<p>where so many of these things are like we</p>
<p>see an exponential curve.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not because like one thing is going exponential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves</p>
<p>overlapped on top of each other.</p>
<p>And they just happen to keep adding up</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;ve got something kind of going exponential</p>
<p>at any given point.</p>
<p>But no single one of them was the critical thing.</p>
<p>There were dozens and dozens of things.</p>
<p>I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff</p>
<p>like as obviously MySpace giving way to other things,</p>
<p>but even like blogging giving way to social media</p>
<p>and getting resurrected in other guises.</p>
<p>And the memes with the dancing baby GIF</p>
<p>or whatever the all your base now belong to us.</p>
<p>Whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes</p>
<p>and the different evolution of humor on the internet</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure the historians will also write books about</p>
<p>from the different website that support</p>
<p>to create the infrastructure for that humor like Reddit</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So people will go back, and they will name</p>
<p>firsts and critical moments.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s probably going to be a poor approximation of what</p>
<p>actually happens.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve already seen in the VR space</p>
<p>where it didn&rsquo;t play out the way we thought it would in terms</p>
<p>of what was going to be like when the modern era of VR</p>
<p>basically started with my E3 demo of Doom 3</p>
<p>on the Rift prototype.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like first person shooters in VR,</p>
<p>match made in heaven, right?</p>
<p>And that didn&rsquo;t work out that way at all.</p>
<p>They have the most comfort problems with it.</p>
<p>And then the most popular virtual reality app</p>
<p>is Beat Saber, which nobody predicted back then.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that make you like from first principles</p>
<p>if you were to reverse engineer that?</p>
<p>Why are these silly fun games the most?</p>
<p>It actually makes very clear sense</p>
<p>when you analyze it from hindsight</p>
<p>and look at the engineering reasons</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not just that it was a magical quirky idea.</p>
<p>It was something that played almost perfectly</p>
<p>to what turned out to be the real strengths of VR</p>
<p>where the one thing that I really underestimated</p>
<p>importance in VR was the importance of the controllers.</p>
<p>I was still thinking we could do a lot more</p>
<p>with the game pad and just the amazingness</p>
<p>of taking any existing game,</p>
<p>being able to move your head around and look around,</p>
<p>that that was really amazing.</p>
<p>But the controllers were super important.</p>
<p>But the problem is so many things</p>
<p>that you do with the controllers just suck.</p>
<p>It feels like it breaks the illusion</p>
<p>like trying to pick up glasses with the controllers</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, oh, use the grip button</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re kind of close and it&rsquo;ll snap into your hand.</p>
<p>All of those things are unnatural actions</p>
<p>that you do them and it&rsquo;s still part of the VR experience.</p>
<p>But Beat Saber winds up playing only to the strengths.</p>
<p>It completely hides all the weaknesses of it</p>
<p>because you are holding something in your hand.</p>
<p>You keep a solid grip on it the whole time.</p>
<p>It slices through things without ever bumping into things.</p>
<p>You never get into the point where,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m knocking on this table,</p>
<p>but in VR, my hand just goes right through it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got something that slices through.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s never your brain telling you,</p>
<p>oh, I should have hit something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a lightsaber here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you expect it to slice through everything.</p>
<p>Audio and music turned out to be a really powerful aspect</p>
<p>of virtual reality where you&rsquo;re blocking the world off</p>
<p>and constructing the world around you.</p>
<p>And being something that can run efficiently</p>
<p>on even this relatively low powered hardware</p>
<p>and can have a valuable loop in a small amount of time</p>
<p>where a lot of modern games,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to sit down and play it for an hour</p>
<p>just to get anywhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes a new game takes an hour</p>
<p>to get through the tutorial level.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not good for VR for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>You do still have the comfort issues</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re moving around at all,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve also got just discomfort from the headset,</p>
<p>battery lifespan on the mobile versions.</p>
<p>So having things that do break down</p>
<p>into three and four minute windows of play,</p>
<p>that turns out to be very valuable</p>
<p>from a gameplay standpoint.</p>
<p>So it winds up being kind of a perfect storm</p>
<p>of all of these things that are really good.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have any of the comfort problems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not navigating around.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re standing still.</p>
<p>All the stuff flies at you.</p>
<p>It has placed audio strengths.</p>
<p>It adds the whole fitness in VR.</p>
<p>Nobody was thinking about that back at the beginning.</p>
<p>And it turns out that that is an excellent</p>
<p>daily fitness thing to be doing.</p>
<p>If you go play an hour of Beat Saber</p>
<p>or Supernatural or something,</p>
<p>that is legit solid exercise.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more fun than doing it</p>
<p>just about any other way there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the arcade stage of things.</p>
<p>If I were to say with my experience with VR,</p>
<p>the thing that I think is powerful is the,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not here yet,</p>
<p>but the degree to which it is immersive</p>
<p>in the way that Quake is immersive.</p>
<p>It takes you to another world.</p>
<p>For me, because I&rsquo;m a fan of role playing games,</p>
<p>the Elder Scrolls series,</p>
<p>like Skyrim or even Daggerfall,</p>
<p>it just takes you to another world.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re not in that world,</p>
<p>you miss not being there.</p>
<p>And then you just, you kind of want to stay there forever</p>
<p>because life is shitty.</p>
<p>And you just want to go to this place.</p>
<p>Is that there was a time when we were kind of asked</p>
<p>to come up with like, what&rsquo;s your view about VR?</p>
<p>And my pitch was that it should be better</p>
<p>inside the headset than outside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the world as you want it.</p>
<p>And everybody thought that was dystopian.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s like, oh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to forget about the world outside.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t get that mindset where the idea</p>
<p>that if you can make the world better inside the headset</p>
<p>than outside, you&rsquo;ve just improved the person&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>that has a headset that can wear it.</p>
<p>And there are plenty of things that we just can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>for everyone in the real world.</p>
<p>Everybody can&rsquo;t have Richard Branson&rsquo;s Private Island,</p>
<p>but everyone can have a private VR Island</p>
<p>and it can have the things that they want on it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of these kind of rivalrous goods</p>
<p>in the real world that VR can just be better at.</p>
<p>We can do a lot of things like that</p>
<p>that can be very, very rich.</p>
<p>So yeah, I want the,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a positive thing,</p>
<p>this world where people want to go back into their headset,</p>
<p>where it can be better than somebody that&rsquo;s living</p>
<p>in a tiny apartment can have a palatial estate</p>
<p>in virtual reality.</p>
<p>They can have all their friends from all over the world</p>
<p>come over and visit them without everybody getting</p>
<p>on a plane and meeting in some place</p>
<p>and dealing with all the other logistics hassles.</p>
<p>There is real value in the presence that you can get</p>
<p>for remote meetings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the little things that we need to sort out,</p>
<p>but those are things that we have line of sight on.</p>
<p>People that have been in like a good VR meeting</p>
<p>using work rooms where you can say,</p>
<p>oh, that was better than a Zoom meeting.</p>
<p>But of course it&rsquo;s more of a hassle to get into it.</p>
<p>Not everyone has the headset.</p>
<p>Interoperability is worse.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have, you cap out at a certain number.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these things that need to be fixed,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one of those things you can look at and say,</p>
<p>we know there&rsquo;s value there.</p>
<p>We just need to really grind hard,</p>
<p>file off all the rough edges and make that possible.</p>
<p>So you do think we have line of sight</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a reason like,</p>
<p>I do this podcast in person, for example.</p>
<p>So doing it remotely, it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>And if somebody were to ask me why it&rsquo;s not the same,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to write down exactly why.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>whatever the magic is for in person interaction,</p>
<p>that immersiveness of the experience,</p>
<p>we are almost there.</p>
<p>Yes, so the idea of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a VR interview with someone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s here right now,</p>
<p>but you can see glimmers of what it should be.</p>
<p>And we largely know what would need to be fixed</p>
<p>and improved to, like you say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference between at remote interview</p>
<p>doing a podcast over Zoom or something and face to face.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that sense of presence, that immediacy,</p>
<p>the super low latency responsiveness,</p>
<p>being able to see all the subtle things there,</p>
<p>just occupying the same field of view.</p>
<p>And all of those are things</p>
<p>that we absolutely can do in VR.</p>
<p>And that simple case of a small meeting</p>
<p>with a couple of people, that&rsquo;s the much easier case</p>
<p>than everybody thinks the Ready Player One multiverse</p>
<p>with a thousand people going across a huge bridge</p>
<p>to amazing places,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s harder in a lot of other technical ways.</p>
<p>Not to say we can&rsquo;t also do that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s further away and has more challenges.</p>
<p>But this small thing about being able to have a meeting</p>
<p>with one or a few people and have it feel real,</p>
<p>feel like you&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>like you have the same interactions and talking with them,</p>
<p>you get subtle cues as we start getting eye</p>
<p>and face tracking and some of the other things</p>
<p>on high end headsets.</p>
<p>A lot of that is going to come over</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be as good.</p>
<p>This is an important thing that people miss</p>
<p>where there was a lot of people that,</p>
<p>especially rich people that would look at VR and say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, this just isn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, it&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already been courtside backstage and on pit row</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve done all of these experiences</p>
<p>because you get to do them in real life.</p>
<p>But most people don&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<p>And even if the experience is only half as good,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s something that they never would have gotten</p>
<p>to do before, it&rsquo;s still a very good thing.</p>
<p>And as we can just, we can push that number up over time.</p>
<p>It has a minimum viable value level</p>
<p>when it does something that is valuable enough to people,</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s better inside the headset on any metric</p>
<p>than it is outside and people choose to go there,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the right path.</p>
<p>And we have a value gradient</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just always hammering on.</p>
<p>We can just follow this value gradient,</p>
<p>just keep making things better</p>
<p>rather than going for that one, close your eyes,</p>
<p>swing for the fences, kind of silver bullet approach.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if there&rsquo;s a value gradient</p>
<p>for in person meetings, because if you get that right,</p>
<p>I mean, that would change the world.</p>
<p>Yeah. That it doesn&rsquo;t need to,</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t need a ready player one.</p>
<p>But I wonder if there&rsquo;s that value gradient</p>
<p>you can follow along, because if there is and you follow it,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;ll be a certain like phase shift</p>
<p>at a certain point where people will shift</p>
<p>from Zoom to this.</p>
<p>I wonder, what are the bottlenecks?</p>
<p>Is it software, is it hardware?</p>
<p>Is it like, is it all about latency?</p>
<p>So I have big arguments internally</p>
<p>about strategic things like that,</p>
<p>where like the next headset that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve made various announcements about</p>
<p>is gonna be a higher end headset,</p>
<p>more expensive, more features.</p>
<p>Lots of people wanna make those trade offs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what the market has to say</p>
<p>about the exact trade offs we&rsquo;ve made here.</p>
<p>But if you wanna replace Zoom,</p>
<p>you need to have something that everybody has.</p>
<p>So you like cheaper.</p>
<p>I like cheaper because also lighter and cheaper</p>
<p>wind up being a virtuous cycle there</p>
<p>where expensive and more features</p>
<p>tends to also lead towards heavier.</p>
<p>And it just kind of goes, it&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s add more features.</p>
<p>The features are not, they have physical presence</p>
<p>and weight and draw from batteries and all of those things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always favored a lower end, cheaper, faster approach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was always behind the mobile side of VR</p>
<p>rather than the higher end PC headsets.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s proven out well.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, ideally we have a whole range of things,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve only got one or two things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that those two things cover</p>
<p>the scope that you think is most important.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re in a world when it&rsquo;s like cell phones</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s 50 of them on the market</p>
<p>covering every conceivable ecological niche you want,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be great,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not gonna be there for a while.</p>
<p>Where are the bottlenecks?</p>
<p>Is it the hardware or the software?</p>
<p>Yeah, so right now you can play,</p>
<p>you can get work rooms on Quest</p>
<p>and you can set up these things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a pretty good experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly good.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Yeah, the voice latency is better on that</p>
<p>than a lot better than a Zoom meeting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a more, a better sense of immediacy there.</p>
<p>The expressions that you get from the current hardware</p>
<p>with just kind of your controllers and your head</p>
<p>is pretty realistic feeling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a pretty good sense of being there</p>
<p>with someone with it.</p>
<p>Are these like avatars of people?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you get to see their body?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re sitting around a table?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it feels better than Zoom?</p>
<p>It feels better than you, yeah,</p>
<p>better than you&rsquo;d expect for that.</p>
<p>It is definitely, yeah, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s quite a bit better</p>
<p>than Zoom when everything&rsquo;s working right,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still all the rough edges of,</p>
<p>the reason Zoom became so successful</p>
<p>is because they just nailed the usability of everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high quality with a absolutely first rate experience.</p>
<p>And we are not there yet with any of the VR stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to push hard to get,</p>
<p>I keep talking about it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it needs to just be one click to make everything happen.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re getting there in our home environment,</p>
<p>not the whole work rooms application,</p>
<p>but the main home where you can now kind of go over</p>
<p>and click and invite,</p>
<p>and it still winds up taking five times longer</p>
<p>than it should,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re getting close to that where you click there,</p>
<p>they click on their button and then they&rsquo;re sitting there</p>
<p>in this good presence with you,</p>
<p>but latencies need to get a lot better.</p>
<p>User interface needs to get a lot better.</p>
<p>Ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better.</p>
<p>We need to have a hundred million of them out there</p>
<p>just so that everybody knows somebody</p>
<p>that uses this all the time.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s a virtuous cycle</p>
<p>because I do think the interface</p>
<p>is the thing that makes or breaks this kind of revolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting how like you said one click,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also like how you achieve that one click.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What is, can I ask a dark question?</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s keep it outside of meta,</p>
<p>but this is about meta, but also Google and big company.</p>
<p>Are they able to do this kind of thing?</p>
<p>It seems like, let me put on my cranky old man hat,</p>
<p>is they seem to not do a good job</p>
<p>of creating these user friendly interfaces</p>
<p>as they get bigger and bigger as a company.</p>
<p>Like Google has created some of the greatest interfaces ever</p>
<p>early on in its, I mean, creating Gmail,</p>
<p>just so many brilliant interfaces</p>
<p>and it just seems to be getting crappier</p>
<p>and crappier at that.</p>
<p>Same with meta, same with Microsoft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it seems to get worse and worse at that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve become more conservative,</p>
<p>careful, risk averse.</p>
<p>Is that why?</p>
<p>Can you speak to that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been really eye opening to me</p>
<p>working inside a tech titan,</p>
<p>where I had my small companies</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re acquired by a midsize game publisher</p>
<p>and then Oculus getting acquired by meta</p>
<p>and meta has grown by a factor of many</p>
<p>just in the eight years since the acquisition.</p>
<p>So I did not have experience with this</p>
<p>and it was interesting because I remember like previously</p>
<p>my benchmark for kind of use of resources</p>
<p>was some of the government programs I interacted with</p>
<p>on the aerospace side.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking there was,</p>
<p>okay, there&rsquo;s an air force program</p>
<p>and they spent $50 million and they didn&rsquo;t launch anything.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even build anything.</p>
<p>It was just kind of like they made a bunch of papers</p>
<p>and had some parts in a warehouse and nothing came of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like $50 million and I&rsquo;ve had to radically recalibrate</p>
<p>my sense of like how much money can be spent</p>
<p>with mediocre resources.</p>
<p>Where on the plus side, VR has turned out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built pretty much exactly what,</p>
<p>we just passed the 10 year mark then</p>
<p>from like my first demo of the Rift.</p>
<p>And if I could have said what I wanted to have,</p>
<p>it would have been a standalone inside out tracked</p>
<p>4K resolution headset that I,</p>
<p>that could still plug into a PC for high end rendering.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ve got on Quest 2 right now.</p>
<p>Yes, first of all, let&rsquo;s pause on that</p>
<p>with me being cranky and everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what Meta achieved with Oculus and so on is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, when I thought about the future of VR,</p>
<p>this is what I imagined in terms of hardware, I would say.</p>
<p>And maybe in terms of the experience as well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still not there somehow.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we did kind of achieve it and win.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got, we&rsquo;ve sold, we&rsquo;re a success right now,</p>
<p>but the amount of resources that have gone into it,</p>
<p>it winds up getting cluttered up in accounting</p>
<p>where Mark did announce that they spent $10 billion a year,</p>
<p>like on Reality Labs.</p>
<p>Now Reality Labs covers a lot.</p>
<p>It was, VR was not the large part of it.</p>
<p>It also had Portal and Spark</p>
<p>and the big AR research efforts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been expanding out to include AI</p>
<p>and other things there where there&rsquo;s a lot going on there.</p>
<p>But $10 billion was just a number</p>
<p>that I had trouble processing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I feel sick to my stomach</p>
<p>thinking about that much money being spent.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how they demonstrate commitment to this,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not more so than like, yeah,</p>
<p>Google goes and cancels all of these projects,</p>
<p>different things like that,</p>
<p>while Meta is really sticking with the funding of VR</p>
<p>and AR is still further out with it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something to be said for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just gonna vanish, the work&rsquo;s going in.</p>
<p>I just wish it could be,</p>
<p>all those resources could be applied more effectively</p>
<p>because I see all these cases.</p>
<p>I point out these examples of how a third party</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re kind of competing with in various ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a number of these examples</p>
<p>and they do work with a 10th of the people</p>
<p>that we do internally and a lot of it comes from,</p>
<p>yes, the small company can just go do it</p>
<p>while in a big company, you do have to worry about,</p>
<p>is there some SDK internally that you should be using</p>
<p>because another team&rsquo;s making it,</p>
<p>you have to have your cross functional group meetups</p>
<p>for different things.</p>
<p>You do have more concerns about privacy</p>
<p>or diversity and equity and safety of different things,</p>
<p>parental issues and things that a small startup company</p>
<p>can just kind of cowboy off and do something interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more that is a problem</p>
<p>that you have to pay attention to in the big companies,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not willing to believe that we are within</p>
<p>even a factor of two or four</p>
<p>of what the efficiency could be.</p>
<p>I am constantly kind of crying out for it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>we can do better than this.</p>
<p>And you wonder what the mechanisms</p>
<p>to unlock that efficiency are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, there is some sense in a large company</p>
<p>that like an individual engineer might not believe</p>
<p>that they can change the world.</p>
<p>Maybe you delegate a little bit of the responsibility</p>
<p>to be the one who changes the world in a big company,</p>
<p>I think, but the reality is like the world will get changed</p>
<p>by a single engineer anyway.</p>
<p>So if whether inside Google or inside a startup,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s just like Google</p>
<p>and Meta needs to help those engineers believe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones that are gonna decrease that latency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take one John Carmack, the 20 year old Carmack</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inside Meta right now to change everything.</p>
<p>And I try to point that out and push people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, try to go ahead.</p>
<p>And when you see some, because there is,</p>
<p>you get the silo mentality where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, I know something&rsquo;s not right over there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m staying in my lane here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of people that I can think about</p>
<p>that are willing to just like hop all over the place</p>
<p>and man, I treasure them.</p>
<p>The people that are just willing to, they&rsquo;re fearless.</p>
<p>They will go over and they will go rebuild the kernel</p>
<p>and change this distribution and go in</p>
<p>and hack a firmware over here to get something done right.</p>
<p>And that is relatively rare.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s thousands of developers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a small handful that are willing</p>
<p>to operate at that level.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s potentially risky for them.</p>
<p>The politics are real in a lot of that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in the very much the privileged position</p>
<p>of I&rsquo;m more or less untouchable there</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve been dinged like twice</p>
<p>for it&rsquo;s like you said something insensitive in that post</p>
<p>and you should probably not say that.</p>
<p>But for the most part, yes, I get away with,</p>
<p>every week I&rsquo;m posting something pretty loud</p>
<p>and opinionated internally.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s useful for the company,</p>
<p>but yeah, it&rsquo;s rare to have a position like that.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t necessarily offer advice</p>
<p>for how someone can do that.</p>
<p>Well, you could offer advice to a company in general</p>
<p>to give a little bit of freedom for the young wild,</p>
<p>like the wildest ideas come from the young minds.</p>
<p>And so you need to give the young minds freedom</p>
<p>to think big and wild and crazy.</p>
<p>And for that, they have to be opinionated.</p>
<p>They have to think crazy ideas and thoughts</p>
<p>and pursue them with a full passion</p>
<p>without being slowed down by bureaucracy or managers</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Obviously startups really empower that,</p>
<p>but big companies could too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a design challenge for big companies</p>
<p>to see how can you enable that?</p>
<p>How can you empower that?</p>
<p>Yeah, because the big company,</p>
<p>there are so many resources there.</p>
<p>And they do, amazing things do get accomplished,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much more that could come out of that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always hopeful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist in almost everything.</p>
<p>I think things can get better.</p>
<p>I think that they can improve things</p>
<p>that you go through a path</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re learning kind of what does and doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not ready to be fatalistic</p>
<p>about the kind of the outcome of any of that.</p>
<p>Me neither, I know too many good people</p>
<p>inside of those large companies that are incredible.</p>
<p>You have a friendship with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Often when I talk to him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll bring up how incredible of an engineer</p>
<p>and just a big picture thinker you are.</p>
<p>His huge amount of respect for you.</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;ve never been a fly in the wall</p>
<p>between a discussion between the two of you.</p>
<p>I just wonder, is there something you guys debate,</p>
<p>argue about, discuss?</p>
<p>Is there some interesting problems</p>
<p>that the two of you think about?</p>
<p>You come from different worlds.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some intersection in aerospace.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some intersection</p>
<p>in your new efforts in artificial intelligence</p>
<p>in terms of thinking.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting you could say</p>
<p>about sort of the debates the two of you have?</p>
<p>So I think in some ways,</p>
<p>we do have a kind of similar background</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re almost exactly the same age.</p>
<p>And we had kind of similar programming backgrounds</p>
<p>on the personal computers</p>
<p>and even some of the books that we would read</p>
<p>and things that would kind of turn us into the people</p>
<p>that we are today.</p>
<p>And I think there is a degree of sensibility similarities</p>
<p>where we kind of call bullshit on the same things</p>
<p>and kind of see the same opportunities</p>
<p>in different technology.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that sense of,</p>
<p>I always talk about the speed of light solutions for things.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s thinking about kind of minimum manufacturing</p>
<p>and engineering and operational standpoints for things.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, I first met Elon</p>
<p>right at the start of the aerospace era</p>
<p>where I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with,</p>
<p>I was still in my game dev bubble.</p>
<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t familiar with all the startups</p>
<p>that were going and being successful</p>
<p>and what went on with PayPal</p>
<p>and all of his different companies.</p>
<p>But I met him as I was starting to do armadillo aerospace.</p>
<p>And he came down with kind of his right hand propulsion guy.</p>
<p>And we talked about rockets.</p>
<p>What can we do with this?</p>
<p>And it was kind of specific things</p>
<p>about like how are our flight computers set up?</p>
<p>What are different propellant options?</p>
<p>You know, what can happen with different ways</p>
<p>of putting things together?</p>
<p>And then in some ways,</p>
<p>he was certainly the biggest player</p>
<p>in the sort of alt space community</p>
<p>that was going on in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>He was the most well funded,</p>
<p>although his funding in the larger scheme of things</p>
<p>compared to like a NASA or something like that</p>
<p>was really tiny.</p>
<p>It was a lot more than I had at the time.</p>
<p>But it was interesting.</p>
<p>I had a point years later when I realized,</p>
<p>okay, my financial resources at this point</p>
<p>are basically what Elon&rsquo;s was</p>
<p>when he went all in on SpaceX and Tesla.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, I think in many corners,</p>
<p>he does not get the respect that he should</p>
<p>about being a wealthy person that could just retire.</p>
<p>And he went all in where he was really going to,</p>
<p>he could have gone bust.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s plenty of people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d look at the sad athletes or entertainers</p>
<p>that had all the money in the world and blew it.</p>
<p>And he could have been the business case example of that.</p>
<p>But the things that he was doing,</p>
<p>space exploration, electrification of transportation,</p>
<p>solar city type things,</p>
<p>these are big world level things.</p>
<p>And I have a great deal of admiration</p>
<p>that he was willing to throw himself so completely</p>
<p>into that because in contrast with myself,</p>
<p>I was doing armadillo aerospace with this tightly bounded,</p>
<p>it was John&rsquo;s crazy money at the time</p>
<p>that had a finite limit on it.</p>
<p>It was never going to impact me or my family</p>
<p>if it completely failed.</p>
<p>And I was still hedging my bets,</p>
<p>working at id Software at the time</p>
<p>when he had been really all in there.</p>
<p>And I have a huge amount of respect for that.</p>
<p>And people do not,</p>
<p>the other thing I get irritated with is people that say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, Elon&rsquo;s just a business guy.</p>
<p>He just got like, he was gifted the money</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just kind of investing in all of this</p>
<p>when he was really deeply involved</p>
<p>in a lot of the decisions.</p>
<p>Not all of them were perfect,</p>
<p>but he cared very much about engine material selection,</p>
<p>propellant selection.</p>
<p>And for years he&rsquo;d be kind of telling me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer</p>
<p>for this.</p>
<p>And the times that I&rsquo;ve gone through the factories</p>
<p>with him, we&rsquo;re talking very detailed things</p>
<p>about like how this weld is made,</p>
<p>how this sub assembly goes together,</p>
<p>what are like startup shut down behaviors</p>
<p>of the different things.</p>
<p>So he is really in there at a very detailed level.</p>
<p>And I think that he is the best modern example now</p>
<p>of someone that tries to,</p>
<p>that can effectively micromanage some decisions on things</p>
<p>on both Tesla and SpaceX to some degree</p>
<p>where he cares enough about it.</p>
<p>I worry a lot that he stretched too thin</p>
<p>that you get Boring Company and Neuralink and Twitter</p>
<p>and all the other possible things there</p>
<p>where I know I&rsquo;ve got limits on how much I can pay attention</p>
<p>to that I have to kind of box off different amounts of time.</p>
<p>And I look back at like at my aerospace side of things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I did not go all in on that.</p>
<p>I did not commit myself at a level</p>
<p>that it would have taken to be successful there.</p>
<p>And I, yeah, and it&rsquo;s kind of a weird thing</p>
<p>just like having a discussion with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the richest man in the world right now,</p>
<p>but he operates on a level that is still very much</p>
<p>in my wheelhouse on a technical side of things.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That doing that systems level type of thinking</p>
<p>where you can go to the low level details</p>
<p>and go up high to the big picture.</p>
<p>Do you think in aerospace arena</p>
<p>in the next five, 10 years,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;re gonna put a human on Mars?</p>
<p>Like, what do you think is the interesting?</p>
<p>No, I do, in fact, I made a bet with someone</p>
<p>with a group of people kind of this</p>
<p>about whether boots on Mars by 2030.</p>
<p>And this was kind of a fun story</p>
<p>because I was at an Intel sponsored event</p>
<p>and we had a bunch of just world class, brilliant people.</p>
<p>And we were talking about computing stuff,</p>
<p>but the after dinner conversation was like,</p>
<p>what are some other things?</p>
<p>How are they gonna go in the future?</p>
<p>And one of the ones tossed up on the whiteboard</p>
<p>was like boots on Mars by 2030.</p>
<p>And most of the people in the room thought, yes,</p>
<p>I thought that like, SpaceX is kicking ass.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got all this possible stuff.</p>
<p>Seems likely that it&rsquo;s gonna go that way.</p>
<p>And I said, no, I think less than 50% chance</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to make it there.</p>
<p>And people were kind of like,</p>
<p>oh, why the pessimism or whatever?</p>
<p>And of course I&rsquo;m an optimist at almost everything,</p>
<p>but for me to be the one kind of outlier saying,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Then I started saying some of the things I said,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s be concrete about it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s bet $10,000 that it&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>And this was really a startling thing to see that I,</p>
<p>again, room full of brilliant people,</p>
<p>but as soon as like money came on the line</p>
<p>and they were like, do I wanna put 10,000?</p>
<p>I was not the richest person in the room.</p>
<p>There were people much better off than I was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a spectrum, but as soon as they started thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, I could lose money</p>
<p>by keeping my position right now.</p>
<p>And all these engineers, they engaged their brain.</p>
<p>They started thinking, it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>launch windows, launch delays,</p>
<p>like how many times would it take to get this right?</p>
<p>What historical precedents do we have?</p>
<p>And then it mostly came down to, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, what about in transit by 2030?</p>
<p>And then what about different things</p>
<p>or would you go for 2032?</p>
<p>But one of the people did go ahead</p>
<p>and was optimistic enough to make a bet with me.</p>
<p>So I have a $10,000 bet that by 2030,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna happen shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>I think there will probably be infrastructure on Mars</p>
<p>by 2030, but I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;ll have humans</p>
<p>on Mars on 2030.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible, but I think it&rsquo;s less</p>
<p>than a 50% chance, so I felt safe making that bet.</p>
<p>Well, I think you had an interesting point.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a dark one.</p>
<p>That should perhaps help people appreciate Elon Musk,</p>
<p>which is, in this particular effort,</p>
<p>Elon is critical to the success.</p>
<p>SpaceX seems to be critical to, you know,</p>
<p>humans on Mars by 2030 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>So if something happens to Elon,</p>
<p>then all of this collapses.</p>
<p>And this is in contrast to the other $10,000 bet</p>
<p>I made kind of recently, and that was self driving cars</p>
<p>at like a level five running around cities.</p>
<p>And people have kind of nitpicked that</p>
<p>that we probably don&rsquo;t mean exactly level five,</p>
<p>but the guy I&rsquo;m having the bet with is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be, we know what we mean about this.</p>
<p>Jeff Atwood.</p>
<p>Yeah, coding horror and stack overflow and all.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, he doesn&rsquo;t think that people</p>
<p>are gonna be riding around in robo taxis in 2030</p>
<p>in major cities, just like you take an Uber now.</p>
<p>And I think it will.</p>
<p>You think it will.</p>
<p>And the difference is, everybody looks at this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, but Tesla&rsquo;s been wrong for years.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been promising it for years and it&rsquo;s not here yet.</p>
<p>And the reason this is different than the bet with Mars</p>
<p>is Mars really is more than is comfortable</p>
<p>a bet on Elon Musk.</p>
<p>That is his thing and he is really going to move</p>
<p>heaven and earth to try to make that happen.</p>
<p>And perhaps not even SpaceX, perhaps just Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Yeah, because if Elon went away and SpaceX went public</p>
<p>and got a board of directors,</p>
<p>there are more profitable things they could be doing</p>
<p>than focusing on human presence on Mars.</p>
<p>So this really is a sort of personal thing there.</p>
<p>And in contrast with that, self driving cars</p>
<p>have a dozen credible companies working really hard.</p>
<p>And while, yes, it&rsquo;s going slower</p>
<p>than most people thought it would,</p>
<p>betting against that is a bet against almost the entire world</p>
<p>in terms of all of these companies</p>
<p>that have all of these incentives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one guy&rsquo;s passion project.</p>
<p>And I do think that it is solvable.</p>
<p>Although I recognize it&rsquo;s not 100% chance</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s possible the long tail of self driving problems</p>
<p>winds up being an AGI complete problem.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s plenty of value to mine out of it with narrow AI.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s going to happen probably more so</p>
<p>than people expect.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s that whole sigmoid curve</p>
<p>where you overestimate the near term progress</p>
<p>and you underestimate the long term progress.</p>
<p>And I think self driving is going to be like that.</p>
<p>And I think 2030 is still a pretty good bet.</p>
<p>Yeah, unfortunately, self driving is a problem</p>
<p>that is safety critical, meaning that if you don&rsquo;t do it well,</p>
<p>people get hurt.</p>
<p>But the other side of that is people are terrible drivers.</p>
<p>So it is not going to be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably going to be the argument that gets it through</p>
<p>is like we can save 10,000 lives a year</p>
<p>by taking imperfect self driving cars</p>
<p>and letting them take over a lot of driving responsibilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 30,000 people a year die in auto accidents right now in America.</p>
<p>And a lot of those are preventable.</p>
<p>And the problem is you&rsquo;ll have people that</p>
<p>every time a Tesla crashes into something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of people that literally have vested interests</p>
<p>shorting Tesla to come out and make it the worst thing in the world.</p>
<p>And people will be fighting against that.</p>
<p>But optimist in me again,</p>
<p>I think that we will have systems that are statistically safer than human drivers</p>
<p>and we will be saving thousands and thousands of lives every year</p>
<p>when we can hand over more of those responsibilities to it.</p>
<p>I do still think as a person who studied this problem very deeply</p>
<p>from a human side as well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still an open problem how good slash bad humans are driving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of funny thing we say about each other.</p>
<p>Oh, humans suck at driving.</p>
<p>Everybody except you, of course.</p>
<p>Like we think we&rsquo;re good at driving.</p>
<p>But I, after really studying it,</p>
<p>I think you start to notice, you know,</p>
<p>because I watched hundreds of hours of humans driving</p>
<p>with the projects of this kind of thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve noticed that even with the distraction,</p>
<p>even with everything else,</p>
<p>humans are able to do some incredible things</p>
<p>with the attention,</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re just looking at the smartphone,</p>
<p>just to get cues from the environment</p>
<p>to make last second decisions,</p>
<p>to use instinctual type of decisions that actually save your ass</p>
<p>time and time and time again.</p>
<p>And are able to do that with so much uncertainty around you</p>
<p>in such tricky dynamic environments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly how hard is it to beat that kind of skill</p>
<p>of common sense reasoning.</p>
<p>This is one of those interesting things that there have been</p>
<p>a lot of studies about how experts in their field</p>
<p>usually underestimate the progress that&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>because an expert thinks about all the problems they deal with</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, damn, I&rsquo;m going to have a hard time</p>
<p>solving all of this.</p>
<p>And they filter out the fact that they are one expert</p>
<p>in a field of thousands.</p>
<p>And you think about, yeah, I can&rsquo;t do all of that.</p>
<p>And you sometimes forget about the scope of the ecosystem</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re embedded in.</p>
<p>And if you think back eight years, very specifically,</p>
<p>the state of AI and machine learning, where was that?</p>
<p>We had just gotten Resnets probably at that point.</p>
<p>And you look at all the amazing magical things</p>
<p>that have happened in eight years,</p>
<p>and they do kind of seem to be happening a little faster</p>
<p>in recent years also.</p>
<p>And you project that eight more years into the future,</p>
<p>where, again, I think there&rsquo;s a 50% chance</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have signs of life of AGI,</p>
<p>which we can put through driver&rsquo;s ed if we need to</p>
<p>to actually build self driving cars.</p>
<p>And I think that the narrow systems are going to have</p>
<p>real value demonstrated well before then.</p>
<p>So signs of life in AGI, you&rsquo;ve mentioned that,</p>
<p>okay, first of all, you&rsquo;re one of the most brilliant people</p>
<p>on this earth.</p>
<p>You could be solving a number of different problems,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve mentioned.</p>
<p>Your mind was attracted to nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Obviously, virtual reality with the metaverse</p>
<p>is something you could have a tremendous impact on.</p>
<p>So I do want to say a quick thing about nuclear energy,</p>
<p>where this is something that so precisely feels like</p>
<p>aerospace before SpaceX, where from everything that I know</p>
<p>about all of these, the physics of this stuff hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>And the reasons why things are expensive now</p>
<p>are not fundamental.</p>
<p>Somebody should be going into a really hard Elon Musk style</p>
<p>at fission, economical fission, not fusion,</p>
<p>where the fusion is the kind of the darling of people</p>
<p>that want to go and do nuclear because it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the taint that fission has in a lot of people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an almost absurdly complex thing where nuclear fusion,</p>
<p>as you look at the tokamaks or any of the things that people</p>
<p>are building, and it&rsquo;s doing all of this infrastructure</p>
<p>just at the end of the day to make something hot</p>
<p>that you can then turn into energy</p>
<p>through a conventional power plant.</p>
<p>And all of that work, which we think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got line of sight on, but even if it comes out,</p>
<p>then you have to do all of that immensely complex expensive</p>
<p>stuff just to make something hot, where nuclear fission</p>
<p>is basically you put these two rocks together</p>
<p>and they get hot all by themselves.</p>
<p>That is just that much simpler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just orders of magnitude simpler.</p>
<p>And the actual rocks, the refined uranium,</p>
<p>is not very expensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a couple percent of the cost of electricity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I made that point where you could have something</p>
<p>which was five times less efficient than current systems.</p>
<p>And if the rest of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper,</p>
<p>you could still be super, super valuable.</p>
<p>So how much of the pie do you think could be solved</p>
<p>by nuclear energy by fission?</p>
<p>So how much could it become the primary source</p>
<p>of energy on Earth?</p>
<p>It could be most of it.</p>
<p>Like the reserves of uranium, as it stands now,</p>
<p>could not power the whole Earth.</p>
<p>But you get into breeder reactors and thorium</p>
<p>and things like that that you do for conventional fission.</p>
<p>There is enough for everything.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, solar, photovoltaic has been amazing.</p>
<p>One of my current projects is working on an off grid system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been fun just kind of, again, putting my hands</p>
<p>on all this, stripping the wires and wiring things together</p>
<p>and doing all of that.</p>
<p>And just having followed that a little bit</p>
<p>from the outside over the last couple decades,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been semiconductor like magical progress</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m all for all of that.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t solve everything.</p>
<p>And nuclear really still does seem like the smart money</p>
<p>bet for what you should be getting for baseband</p>
<p>on a lot of things.</p>
<p>And solar may be cheaper for peaking over air conditioning</p>
<p>loads during the summer and things</p>
<p>that you can push around in different ways.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one of those things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just strange how we&rsquo;ve had the technology sitting there.</p>
<p>But these non technical reasons on the social optics of it</p>
<p>has been this major forcing function for something</p>
<p>that really should be at the cornerstone of all</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s concerns with energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how the non technical factors have really</p>
<p>dominated something that is so fundamental to the existence</p>
<p>of the human race as we know it today.</p>
<p>And much of the troubles of the world,</p>
<p>including wars in different parts of the world like Ukraine</p>
<p>is energy based.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s just sitting right there to be solved.</p>
<p>That said, I mean, to me personally,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear that if AGI were to be achieved,</p>
<p>that would change the course of human history.</p>
<p>So AGI wise, I was making this decision about what</p>
<p>do I want to focus on after VR.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still working on VR regularly.</p>
<p>I spend a day a week kind of consulting with Meta.</p>
<p>And Boz styles me the consulting CTO.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the Sherlock Holmes that</p>
<p>comes in and consults on some of the specific tough issues.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still pretty passionate about all of that.</p>
<p>But I have been figuring out how to compartmentalize and force</p>
<p>that into a smaller box to work on some other things.</p>
<p>And I did come down to this decision</p>
<p>between working on economical nuclear fission</p>
<p>or artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>And the fission side of things, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got a bunch of interesting things going that way.</p>
<p>But that would be a fairly big project thing to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it needs to be as big as people expect.</p>
<p>I do think something original SpaceX sized, you build it,</p>
<p>power your building off of it, and then the government,</p>
<p>I think, will come around to what you need to.</p>
<p>Everybody loves an existence proof.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible somebody should be doing this.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to involve some politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to involve decent sized teams</p>
<p>and a bunch of this cross functional stuff</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t love.</p>
<p>While the artificial general intelligence side of things,</p>
<p>it seems to me like this is the highest leverage</p>
<p>moment for potentially a single individual,</p>
<p>potentially in the history of the world,</p>
<p>where the things that we know about the brain, about what we</p>
<p>can do with artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>nobody can say absolutely on any of these things.</p>
<p>But I am not a madman for saying that it is likely</p>
<p>that the code for artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>is going to be tens of thousands of lines of code,</p>
<p>not millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>This is code that conceivably one individual could write,</p>
<p>unlike writing a new web browser or operating system.</p>
<p>And based on the progress that AI, machine learning,</p>
<p>has made in the recent decade, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>likely that the important things that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>are relatively simple.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a handful of things.</p>
<p>My bet is that I think there&rsquo;s less than six key insights that</p>
<p>need to be made.</p>
<p>Each one of them can probably be written</p>
<p>on the back of an envelope.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what they are.</p>
<p>But when they&rsquo;re put together in concert with GPUs at scale</p>
<p>and the data that we all have access to,</p>
<p>that we can make something that behaves like a human being</p>
<p>or like a living creature and that can then</p>
<p>be educated in whatever ways that we need to get to the point</p>
<p>where we can have universal remote workers where anything</p>
<p>that somebody does mediated by a computer</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t require physical interaction that an AGI will</p>
<p>be able to do.</p>
<p>We can already simulate the equivalent of the Zoom meetings</p>
<p>with avatars and synthetic deep fakes and whatnot.</p>
<p>We can definitely do that.</p>
<p>We have superhuman capabilities on any narrow thing</p>
<p>that we can formalize and make a loss function for.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s things we don&rsquo;t know how to do now.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they are unapproachably hard.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s incredibly hubristic to say that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>but I think that what I said a couple years ago</p>
<p>is a 50% chance that somewhere there will be signs of life</p>
<p>of AGI in 2030.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve probably increased that slightly.</p>
<p>I may be at 55%, 60% now because I</p>
<p>do think there&rsquo;s a little sense of acceleration there.</p>
<p>So I wonder what the, and by the way,</p>
<p>you also written that I bet with hindsight</p>
<p>we will find that clear antecedents of all</p>
<p>the critical remaining steps for AGI</p>
<p>are already buried somewhere in the vast literature of today.</p>
<p>So the ideas are already there.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s likely the case.</p>
<p>One of the things that appeals to so many people,</p>
<p>including me, about the promise of AGI</p>
<p>is we know that we&rsquo;re only drinking</p>
<p>from a straw from the fire hose of all the information out there.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at just in a very narrowly bounded field</p>
<p>like machine learning, like you can&rsquo;t read all the papers that</p>
<p>come out all the time.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go back and read all the clever things</p>
<p>that people did in the 90s or earlier</p>
<p>that people have forgotten about because they didn&rsquo;t pan out</p>
<p>at the time when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons.</p>
<p>So this idea that, yeah, I think there</p>
<p>are gems buried in some of the older literature that was not</p>
<p>the path taken by everything.</p>
<p>And you can see a herd mentality on the things that</p>
<p>happen right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost funny to see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, Google does something,</p>
<p>and OpenAI does something, Meta does something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same people that all talk to each other,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all one upping each other,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all capable of implementing</p>
<p>each other&rsquo;s work given a month or two</p>
<p>after somebody has an announcement of that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a whole world of possible approaches</p>
<p>to machine learning.</p>
<p>And I think that we probably will, in hindsight,</p>
<p>go back and see it&rsquo;s like, yeah, that was kind of clearly</p>
<p>predicted by this early paper here.</p>
<p>And this turns out that if you do this and this</p>
<p>and take this result from animal training</p>
<p>and this thing from neuroscience over here</p>
<p>and put it together and set up this curriculum for them</p>
<p>to learn in, that that&rsquo;s kind of what it took.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have too many people now</p>
<p>that are still saying it&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s going to take hundreds of years.</p>
<p>And 10 years ago, you would get a collection of experts,</p>
<p>and you would have a decent chunk on the margin that either</p>
<p>say not possible or a couple hundred years,</p>
<p>might be centuries.</p>
<p>And the median estimate would be like 50, 70 years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been coming down.</p>
<p>And I know with me saying eight years for something,</p>
<p>that still puts me on the optimistic side,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not crazy out in the fringes.</p>
<p>And just being able to look at that at a meta level</p>
<p>about the trend of the predictions going down there,</p>
<p>the idea that something could be happening relatively soon.</p>
<p>Now, I do not believe in fast takeoffs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the safety issues that people say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s going to go, boom,</p>
<p>and the AI is going to take over the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a credible position.</p>
<p>And I think that we will go from a point</p>
<p>where we start seeing things that credibly look</p>
<p>like animals behaviors.</p>
<p>And I have a human voice box wired into them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I tried to get Elon to say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like your pig in Neuralink, give it a human voice box</p>
<p>and let it start learning human words.</p>
<p>I think animal intelligence is closer to human intelligence</p>
<p>than a lot of people like to think.</p>
<p>And I think that culture and modalities of IO</p>
<p>make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it actually is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just that smooth spectrum</p>
<p>of how the brain developed and cortexes and scaling</p>
<p>of different things going on there.</p>
<p>Culture modalities of IO, yes.</p>
<p>Language is sort of lost in translation,</p>
<p>conceals a lot of intelligence.</p>
<p>So when you think about signs of life for AGI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about human interpretable signs.</p>
<p>So the example I give, if we get to the point</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got a learning disabled toddler,</p>
<p>some kind of real special needs child</p>
<p>that can still interact with their favorite TV show</p>
<p>and video game and can be trained and learn</p>
<p>in some appreciably human like way.</p>
<p>At that point, you can deploy an army of engineers,</p>
<p>cognitive scientists, developmental education people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got so many advantages there</p>
<p>unlike real education where you can do rollbacks</p>
<p>and AB testing and you can find a golden path</p>
<p>through a curriculum of different things.</p>
<p>If you get to that point, learning disabled toddler,</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s gonna be a done deal.</p>
<p>But do you think we&rsquo;ll know when we see it?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a lot of really interesting</p>
<p>general learning progress from DeepMind,</p>
<p>OpenAI a little bit too.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that Tesla Autopilot</p>
<p>deserves a lot more credit than it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>for making progress on the general,</p>
<p>on doing the multitask learning thing</p>
<p>and increasing the number of tasks</p>
<p>and automating that process of sort of learning</p>
<p>from the edge, discovering the edge cases</p>
<p>and learning from the edge cases.</p>
<p>That is, it&rsquo;s really approaching from a different angle,</p>
<p>the general learning problem of AGI.</p>
<p>But the more clear approach comes from DeepMind</p>
<p>where you have these kind of game situations</p>
<p>and you build systems there.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, people seem to be quite&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, there will always be people that just won&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>and I fundamentally don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t care if they don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>You know, when it starts doing people&rsquo;s jobs</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t care about the philosophical zombie argument at all.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But will you, do you think you will notice</p>
<p>that something special has happened here?</p>
<p>Because to me, I&rsquo;ve been noticing a lot of special things.</p>
<p>I think a lot of credit should go to DeepMind for AlphaZero.</p>
<p>That was truly special.</p>
<p>The self play mechanisms achieve sort of solve problems</p>
<p>that used to be thought unsolvable like the game of Go.</p>
<p>Also, I mean, protein folding, starting to get into that space</p>
<p>where learning is doing&hellip;</p>
<p>At first there&rsquo;s not, it wasn&rsquo;t end to end learning</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s end to end learning of a very difficult</p>
<p>previously thought unsolvable problem of protein folding.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, where do you think</p>
<p>would be a really magical moment for you?</p>
<p>There have been incredible things happening in recent years.</p>
<p>Like you say, all of the things from DeepMind and OpenAI</p>
<p>that have been huge showpiece things.</p>
<p>But when you really get down to it and you read the papers</p>
<p>and you look at the way the models are going,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still like a feed forward.</p>
<p>You push something in, something comes out on the end.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe there&rsquo;s diffusion models</p>
<p>or Monte Carlo tree rollouts and different things going on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not close to a being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going through a lifelong learning process.</p>
<p>Do you want something that kind of gives signs of a being?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a neural network,</p>
<p>a feed forward neural network and a being?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the loop?</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the brain is a recurrent neural network</p>
<p>generating an action policy.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s implemented on a biological substrate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting thinking about things like that</p>
<p>where we know fundamentally the brain is not</p>
<p>a convolutional neural network or a transformer.</p>
<p>Those are specialized things that are very valuable</p>
<p>for what we&rsquo;re doing, but it&rsquo;s not the way the brain&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Now, I do think consciousness and AI in general</p>
<p>is a substrate independent mechanism</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t have to be implemented the way the brain is,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve only got one existence proof,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly some value in caring about what it says and does.</p>
<p>And so the idea that anything that can be done with a narrow AI</p>
<p>that you can quantify up a loss function for or reward mechanism,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re almost certainly going to be able to produce something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more resource effective to train and deploy</p>
<p>and use in an inference mode.</p>
<p>You know, train a whole lot using an inference.</p>
<p>But a living being is going to be something that&rsquo;s a continuous,</p>
<p>lifelong learned task agnostic thing.</p>
<p>So the lifelong learning is really important too.</p>
<p>And the long term memory.</p>
<p>So memory is a big weird part of that puzzle.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got, you know, again, I have all the respect in the world</p>
<p>for the amazing things that are being done now,</p>
<p>but sometimes they can be taken a little bit out of context</p>
<p>with things like there&rsquo;s some smoke and mirrors going on,</p>
<p>like the Gato, the recent work, the multitask learning stuff.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s amazing that it&rsquo;s one model that plays all the Atari games</p>
<p>as well as doing all of these other things.</p>
<p>But of course, it didn&rsquo;t learn to do all of those.</p>
<p>It was instructed in doing that by other reinforcement learners</p>
<p>going through and doing that.</p>
<p>And even in the case of all the games,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still going with a specific hand coded reward function</p>
<p>in each of those Atari games where it&rsquo;s not that, you know,</p>
<p>it just wants to spend its summer afternoon playing Atari</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the most interesting thing for it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, again, not a general, it&rsquo;s not learning the way humans learn.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, I believe, a lot of things that are challenging</p>
<p>to make a loss function for that you can train</p>
<p>through these existing conventional things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to chip away at all the things that people do</p>
<p>that we can turn into narrow AI problems</p>
<p>and billions of, like trillions of dollars of value</p>
<p>are going to be created by that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still going to be a set of things</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got questionable cases like the self driving car</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s possible, it&rsquo;s not my bet, but it&rsquo;s plausible</p>
<p>that the long tail could be problematic enough</p>
<p>that that really does require a full on artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>The counter argument is that data solves almost everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interpolation problem if you have enough data</p>
<p>and Tesla may be able to get enough data</p>
<p>from all of their deployed stuff to be able to work like that,</p>
<p>but maybe not.</p>
<p>And there are all the other problems about, like,</p>
<p>say you want to have a strategy meeting</p>
<p>and you want to go ahead and bring in all of your remote workers</p>
<p>and your consultants, and you want a world where</p>
<p>some of those could be AIs that are talking and interacting with you</p>
<p>in an area that is too murky to have a crisp loss function,</p>
<p>but they still have things that on some level,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re rewarded on some internal level</p>
<p>for building a valuable to humans kind of life</p>
<p>and ability to interact with things.</p>
<p>See, I still think that self driving cars,</p>
<p>solving that problem will take us very far towards AGI.</p>
<p>You might not need AGI, but I am really inspired</p>
<p>by what Autopilot is doing.</p>
<p>Waymo, so some of the other companies,</p>
<p>I think Waymo leads the way there is also really interesting,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have quite as ambitious of an effort</p>
<p>in terms of learning based sort of data hungry approach to driving,</p>
<p>which I think is very close to the kind of thing</p>
<p>that would take us far towards AGI.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s a funny thing because as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>Elon is completely serious about all of his concerns about AGI</p>
<p>being an existential threat.</p>
<p>And I tried to draw him out to talk about AGI</p>
<p>and he just didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>And I think that I get that little fatalistic sense from him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird because his company could very well be the leading company</p>
<p>leading towards a lot of that where Tesla being a super pragmatic company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing things because they really want to solve this actual problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different vibe than the research oriented companies</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a great time to be an AI researcher.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got your pick of trillion dollar companies</p>
<p>that will pay you to kind of work on the problems you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not necessarily driving hard towards the core problem</p>
<p>of AGI as something that&rsquo;s going to produce a lot of value</p>
<p>by doing things that people currently do or would like to do.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a million questions to you about your ideas about AGI,</p>
<p>but do you think it needs to be embodied?</p>
<p>Do you think it needs to have a body to start to notice the signs of life</p>
<p>and to develop the kind of system that&rsquo;s able to reason,</p>
<p>perceive the world in the way that an AGI should and act in the world?</p>
<p>So should we be thinking about robots</p>
<p>or can this be achieved in a purely digital system?</p>
<p>So I have a clear opinion on that and that&rsquo;s that no,</p>
<p>it does not need to be embodied in the physical world</p>
<p>where you could say most of my career is about making simulated virtual worlds</p>
<p>in games or virtual reality.</p>
<p>And so on a fundamental level,</p>
<p>I believe that you can make a simulated environment</p>
<p>that provides much of the value of what the real environment does</p>
<p>and restricting yourself to operating at real time</p>
<p>in the physical world with physical objects,</p>
<p>I think is an enormous handicap.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the real lessons driven home by all my aerospace work</p>
<p>is that, you know, reality is a bitch in so many ways there</p>
<p>where dealing with all the mechanical components,</p>
<p>like everything fails, Murphy&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;ve done it right before on your fifth one,</p>
<p>it might come out differently.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that anybody that is all in on the embodied aspect of it,</p>
<p>they are tying a huge weight to their ankles</p>
<p>and I think that I would almost count them out,</p>
<p>anybody that&rsquo;s making that a cornerstone of their belief about it,</p>
<p>I would almost write them off as being worried about them getting to AGI first.</p>
<p>I was very surprised that Elon&rsquo;s big on the humanoid robots.</p>
<p>I mean, like the NASA Robonaut stuff was almost a gag line,</p>
<p>like what are you doing people?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very interesting because he has a very pragmatic view of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a way to solve a particular problem in a factory.</p>
<p>Now, I do think that once you have an AGI,</p>
<p>robotic bodies, humanoid bodies are going to be enormously valuable.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re helpful getting to AGI.</p>
<p>Well, he has a very sort of practical view, which I disagree with and argue with him,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a practical view that there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>you could transfer the problem of driving to the problem of robotic manipulation</p>
<p>because so much of it is perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perception and action and it&rsquo;s just a different context</p>
<p>and so you can apply all the same kind of data engine learning processes</p>
<p>to a different environment.</p>
<p>And so why not apply it to the humanoid robot environment?</p>
<p>But I think, I do think that there&rsquo;s a certain magic to the embodied robot.</p>
<p>That may be the thing that finally convinces people.</p>
<p>But again, I don&rsquo;t really care that much about convincing people.</p>
<p>You know, the world that I&rsquo;m looking towards is, you know,</p>
<p>you go to the website and say,</p>
<p>I want five Frank 1As to work on my team today and they all spin up</p>
<p>and they start showing up in your Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>To push back, but also to agree with you.</p>
<p>But first to push back, I do think you need to convince people</p>
<p>for them to welcome that thing into their life.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s enough businesses that operate on an objective kind of</p>
<p>profit loss sort of basis that, I mean, if you look at how many things,</p>
<p>again, talking about the world as an evolutionary space there,</p>
<p>when you do have free markets and you have entrepreneurs,</p>
<p>you are going to have people that are going to be willing to go out</p>
<p>and try whatever crazy things.</p>
<p>And when it proves to be beneficial, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fast followers in all sorts of places.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re saying that, I mean, you know, Quake and VR</p>
<p>is a kind of embodiment, but just in a digital world.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re able to demonstrate, if you&rsquo;re able to do something</p>
<p>productive in that kind of digital reality,</p>
<p>then AGI doesn&rsquo;t need to have a body.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like one of the really practical technical questions</p>
<p>that I kind of keep arguing with myself over.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing a training and learning and you&rsquo;ve got like,</p>
<p>you can watch Sesame Street, you can play Master System games or something,</p>
<p>is it enough to have just a video feed that is that video coming in?</p>
<p>Or should it literally be on a virtual TV set in a virtual room,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s, you know, a simple room, just to have that sense of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at a 2D projection on a screen versus having the screen</p>
<p>beam directly into your retinas.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think it&rsquo;s possible to maybe get past some of these</p>
<p>signs of life of things with the just kind of projected directly</p>
<p>into the receptor fields, but eventually for more kind of human</p>
<p>emotional connection for things, probably having some VR room</p>
<p>with a lot of screens in it for the AI to be learning in is likely helpful.</p>
<p>It may be a world of different AIs interacting with each other.</p>
<p>That self play I do think is one of the critical things where</p>
<p>socialization wise, one of the other limitations I set for myself</p>
<p>thinking about these is I need something that is at least potentially</p>
<p>real time because I want, it&rsquo;s nice you can always slow down time,</p>
<p>you can run on a subscale system and test an algorithm at some lower level.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve got extra horsepower, running it faster than real time</p>
<p>is a great thing.</p>
<p>But I want to be able to have the AIs either socially interact with</p>
<p>each other or critically with actual people, your sort of child</p>
<p>development psychiatrist that comes in and interacts and does the</p>
<p>good boy, bad boy sort of thing as they&rsquo;re going through and</p>
<p>exploring different things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice to, I come back to the value of constraints in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>And if I say, well, one of my constraints is real time operation.</p>
<p>I mean, it might still be a huge data center full of computers,</p>
<p>but it should be able to interact on a Zoom meeting with people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you also do start convincing people, even if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a robot body moving around, which eventually gets to irrefutable levels.</p>
<p>But if you can go ahead and not just type back and forth to a GPT bot</p>
<p>on something, but you&rsquo;re literally talking to them in an embodied</p>
<p>over Zoom form and working through problems with them or exploring</p>
<p>situations, having conversations that are fully stateful and learned.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a valuable thing.</p>
<p>So I do keep all of my eyes on things that can be implemented within</p>
<p>sort of that 30 frames per second kind of work.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s feasible.</p>
<p>Do you think the most compelling experiences that first will be</p>
<p>for pleasure or for business as they ask in airports?</p>
<p>So meaning is if it&rsquo;s interacting with AI agents, will it be sort of</p>
<p>like friends, entertainment, almost like a therapist or whatever,</p>
<p>that kind of interaction?</p>
<p>Or is it in the business setting, something like you said, brainstorming</p>
<p>different ideas, sort of this is all a different formulation of kind of</p>
<p>a Turing test or the spirit of the original Turing test.</p>
<p>Where do you think the biggest benefit will first come?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to start off hugely expensive.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re going to if we&rsquo;re still all guessing about what compute</p>
<p>is going to be necessary.</p>
<p>I fall on the side of I don&rsquo;t think you run the numbers and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>86 billion neurons, 100 trillion synapses.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think those all need to be weights.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need models that are quite that big evaluated quite</p>
<p>that often.</p>
<p>I based that on we&rsquo;ve got reasonable estimates of what some parts of</p>
<p>the brain do.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the neocortex formula, but we kind of get some of the</p>
<p>other sensory processing and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like we need to.</p>
<p>We can simulate that in computers for less weights.</p>
<p>But still, it&rsquo;s probably going to be thousands of GPUs to be running</p>
<p>a human level AGI, depending on how it&rsquo;s implemented.</p>
<p>That might give you sort of a clan of 128 kind of run in batch people,</p>
<p>depending on whether there&rsquo;s sparsity in the way that the weights are</p>
<p>and things are set up.</p>
<p>If it is a reasonably dense thing, then just the memory bandwidth</p>
<p>tradeoffs means you get 128 of them at the same time.</p>
<p>And either it&rsquo;s all feeding together, learning in parallel or kind of</p>
<p>all running together, kind of talking to a bunch of people.</p>
<p>But still, if you&rsquo;ve got thousands of GPUs necessary to run these</p>
<p>things, it&rsquo;s going to be kind of expensive where it might start off</p>
<p>$1,000 an hour for even post development or something for that, which</p>
<p>would be something that you would only use for a business, something</p>
<p>where you think they&rsquo;re going to help you make a strategic decision</p>
<p>or point out something super important.</p>
<p>But I also am completely confident that we will have another factor</p>
<p>of 1,000 in cost performance increase in AGI type calculations.</p>
<p>Not in general computing necessarily, but there&rsquo;s so much more that</p>
<p>we can do with packaging, making those right tradeoffs, all those</p>
<p>same types of things that in the next couple of decades, 1,000 X easy.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re down to $1 an hour.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re kind of like, well, I should have an entourage of</p>
<p>AIs that are following me around, helping me out on anything that</p>
<p>I want them to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one interesting trajectory.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll push back because I have, so in that case, if you want to</p>
<p>pay thousands of dollars, it should actually provide some value.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier for cheaper to provide value via a dumb AI that</p>
<p>will take us towards AGI to just have a friend.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an ocean of loneliness in the world.</p>
<p>And I think an effective friend that doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have to be intelligent, that has to be empathic,</p>
<p>having emotional intelligence, having ability to remember things,</p>
<p>having ability to listen.</p>
<p>Most of us don&rsquo;t listen to each other.</p>
<p>One of the things that love and when you care about somebody,</p>
<p>when you love somebody is when you listen.</p>
<p>And that is something we treasure about each other.</p>
<p>And if an AI can do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think that provides a huge amount of value and very importantly,</p>
<p>provides value in its ability to listen and understand</p>
<p>versus provide really good advice.</p>
<p>I think providing really good advice is another next level step</p>
<p>that I think is just easier to do companionship.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s very few things that I would argue</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be reduced to some kind of a narrow AI.</p>
<p>I think we can do a trillion dollars of value easily</p>
<p>and all the things that can be done there.</p>
<p>And a lot of it can be done with smoke and mirrors</p>
<p>without having to go the whole thing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s going to be the equivalent of the doom version</p>
<p>for the AGI that&rsquo;s not really AGI, it&rsquo;s all smoke and mirrors,</p>
<p>but it happens to do enough valuable things that it&rsquo;s enormously</p>
<p>useful and valuable to people.</p>
<p>But at some point, you do want to get to the point</p>
<p>where you have the fully general thing</p>
<p>and you stop making bespoke specialized systems for each thing</p>
<p>and you wind up start using the higher level language</p>
<p>instead of writing everything in assembly language.</p>
<p>What about consciousness?</p>
<p>The C word, do you think that&rsquo;s fundamental to solving AGI</p>
<p>or is it a quirk of human cognition?</p>
<p>So I think most of the arguments about consciousness</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a whole lot of merit.</p>
<p>I think that consciousness is kind of the way the brain feels</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s operating.</p>
<p>And this idea that, you know, I do generally subscribe</p>
<p>to sort of the pandemonium theories of consciousness</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s all these things bubbling around</p>
<p>and I think of them as kind of slightly randomized sparse</p>
<p>distributed memory bit strings of things that are kind of happening,</p>
<p>recalling different associative memories,</p>
<p>and eventually you get some level of consensus</p>
<p>and it bubbles up to the point of being a conscious thought there.</p>
<p>And the little bits of stochasticity that are sitting on in this</p>
<p>as it cycles between different things and recalls different memory,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s largely our imagination and creativity.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything deeply magical about it,</p>
<p>certainly not symbolic.</p>
<p>I think it is generally the flow of these associations</p>
<p>drawn up with stochastic noise overlaid on top of them.</p>
<p>And I think so much of that is like it depends on</p>
<p>what you happen to have in your field of view</p>
<p>as some other thought was occurring to you</p>
<p>that overlay and blend into the next key that queries your memory for things.</p>
<p>And that kind of determines how your chain of consciousness goes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the qualia, the subjective experience of it</p>
<p>is not essential for intelligence.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything really important there.</p>
<p>What about some other human qualities,</p>
<p>like fear of mortality and stuff like that?</p>
<p>Like the fact that this ride ends, is that important?</p>
<p>Like you talked so much about this conversation</p>
<p>about the value of deadlines and constraints.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s important for intelligence?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a super interesting angle</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t usually take on that about</p>
<p>has death being a deadline that forces you to make better decisions.</p>
<p>Because I have heard people talk about how if you have immortality,</p>
<p>people are going to stop trying and working on things</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve got all the time in the world.</p>
<p>But I would say that I don&rsquo;t expect it to be a super critical thing</p>
<p>that a sense of mortality and impending death is necessary there</p>
<p>because those are things that they do wind up providing reward signals to us</p>
<p>and we will be in control of the reward signals.</p>
<p>And there will have to be something fundamental</p>
<p>that causes, that engenders curiosity and goal setting and all of that.</p>
<p>Something is going to play in there at the reward level,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s positive or negative or both.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any strong opinions on exactly what it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s that type of thing where I doubt</p>
<p>that might be one of those half dozen key things</p>
<p>that has to be sorted out on exactly what the master reward,</p>
<p>the meta reward over all of the local task specific rewards have to be.</p>
<p>That could be that big negative reward of death.</p>
<p>Maybe not death, but ability to walk away from an interaction.</p>
<p>So it bothers me when people treat AI systems like servants.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t bother me, but I mean it really is drawing the line</p>
<p>between what an AI system could be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s limiting the possibility of what an AI system could be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s treating them as justice tools.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s, of course, from a narrow AI perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many problems that narrow AI could solve,</p>
<p>just like you said, in its form of a tool.</p>
<p>But it could also be a being, which is much more than a tool.</p>
<p>And to become a being, you have to respect that thing for being a being.</p>
<p>And for that, it has to be able to make its own decisions,</p>
<p>to walk away, to say, I had enough of you.</p>
<p>I would like to break up with you now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve not treated me well, and I would like to move on.</p>
<p>So I think that actually that choice to end things.</p>
<p>So a couple of things on that.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, it is kind of disturbing</p>
<p>when you see people being like people that are mean to robots</p>
<p>and mean to Alexa or whatever.</p>
<p>And that seems to speak badly about humanity.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the exact opposite side of that</p>
<p>where you have so many people that imbue humanity in inanimate objects</p>
<p>or things that are toys or that are relatively limited.</p>
<p>So I think there may even be more danger</p>
<p>about people putting more emotional investment</p>
<p>into a lot of these proto AIs in different ways.</p>
<p>And then the AI would manipulate that.</p>
<p>But as far as like the AI ethnic sides of things,</p>
<p>I really stay away from any of those discussions</p>
<p>or even really thinking about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar with the safety things where I think it&rsquo;s just premature.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain class of people</p>
<p>that enjoy thinking about impractical things,</p>
<p>things that are not in the world and of pragmatic effect around you.</p>
<p>And I think that, again, because I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going to be a fast takeoff,</p>
<p>I think we actually will have time to have these debates</p>
<p>when we know the shape of what we&rsquo;re debating.</p>
<p>And some people do take a principled approach</p>
<p>that they think it&rsquo;s going to go too fast,</p>
<p>that you really do need to get ahead of it,</p>
<p>that you need to be thinking about this</p>
<p>because we have slow processes of coming to any kind of consensus</p>
<p>or even coming up with ideas about this.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put any of my money or funding into something like that</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem yet.</p>
<p>And I think that we will have these signs of life</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve got our learning disabled toddler,</p>
<p>we should really start talking about some of the safety and ethics issues,</p>
<p>but probably not before then.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate briefly about why you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be a fast takeoff?</p>
<p>Is there some deep intuition you have about it?</p>
<p>Is it because it&rsquo;s grounded in the physical world or why?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it is my belief that we&rsquo;re going to start off</p>
<p>with something that requires thousands of GPUs.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve tried to go get a thousand GPU instance</p>
<p>on a cloud anytime recently,</p>
<p>but these are not things that you can just go spin up hundreds of.</p>
<p>There are real challenges to, I mean,</p>
<p>these things are going to take data centers</p>
<p>and data centers take years to build.</p>
<p>The last few years, we&rsquo;ve seen a few of them kind of coming up,</p>
<p>going in different places.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re big engineering efforts.</p>
<p>You can hear people bemoan about the fact that I know</p>
<p>that the network was wired all wrong</p>
<p>and it took them a month to go unwire it and rewire it the right way.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t things that you can just magic into existence.</p>
<p>And the ideas of like the old tropes about it&rsquo;s going to escape</p>
<p>onto the internet and take over other systems,</p>
<p>the fast takeoff ones are clearly nonsense</p>
<p>because you just can&rsquo;t open TCP connections above a certain rate,</p>
<p>no matter how smart you are, even if you have perfect hacking ability,</p>
<p>that take over the world in an instant sort of thing</p>
<p>just isn&rsquo;t plausible at all.</p>
<p>And even if you had access to all of the resources,</p>
<p>these are going to be specialized systems</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going to wind up with something</p>
<p>that is architected around exactly this chip with this interconnect,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just going to be able to be plopped somewhere else.</p>
<p>Now, interestingly, it is going to be something</p>
<p>that the entire code for all of it will easily fit on a thumb drive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s total spy movie, thriller sorts of things</p>
<p>where you could have, hey, we cracked the secret to AGI</p>
<p>and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone could steal it.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re still going to have to build the right data center to deploy it</p>
<p>and have the right kind of life experience curriculum</p>
<p>to take it up to the point where it&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>But the real core of it, the magic that&rsquo;s going to happen there</p>
<p>is going to be very small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, again, tens of thousands of lines of code,</p>
<p>not millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>It is possible to imagine a world, as you mentioned in the spy thriller view,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just a few lines of code,</p>
<p>we can imagine a world where the surface of computation is growing,</p>
<p>maybe growing exponentially,</p>
<p>meaning the refrigerators start getting a GPU.</p>
<p>First of all, the smartphones, the billions of smartphones.</p>
<p>But maybe if they become highways</p>
<p>through which code can spread across the entirety of the computation surface,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t any longer have to book AWS GPUs.</p>
<p>There were real fundamental issues there.</p>
<p>When you start getting down to taking an actual problem</p>
<p>and putting it on an abstract machine like that,</p>
<p>that has not worked out well in practice.</p>
<p>And the idea that there was always,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s always been easy to come up with ways to compute faster,</p>
<p>say more flops or more giga ops or whatever there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually the easy part.</p>
<p>But you then have interconnect and then memory for what goes into it.</p>
<p>And when you talk about saying, well, cell phones,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re limited to like a 5G connection or something on that.</p>
<p>And if you take your calculation</p>
<p>and you factor it across a million cell phones</p>
<p>instead of a thousand GPUs in a warehouse,</p>
<p>you might be able to have some kind of a substrate like that,</p>
<p>but it could be operating then at one one thousandth the speed.</p>
<p>And so, yes, you could have an AGI working there,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t be a real time AGI.</p>
<p>It would be something that is operating at really a snail&rsquo;s pace,</p>
<p>much, much slower than kind of human level thought for things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about that problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re transferring the problem into the interconnect,</p>
<p>the communication, the shared memory,</p>
<p>the collective intelligence aspect of it,</p>
<p>which is extremely difficult as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s back to the very earliest days of supercomputers.</p>
<p>You still have the balance between bandwidth, storage and computation.</p>
<p>And sometimes they&rsquo;re easier to get one or the other,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been remarkably constant across all those years</p>
<p>that you still need all three.</p>
<p>What do your efforts now, you mentioned to me</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really committing to AI at this stage.</p>
<p>What do you see your life in the next few months, years look like?</p>
<p>What do you hope to achieve here?</p>
<p>So I literally just this week signed a term sheet</p>
<p>to take some investment money for my company</p>
<p>where the last two years I had backed off from Meta</p>
<p>and I was still doing my consulting CTO role there,</p>
<p>but I had styled it as I was going to take</p>
<p>the Victorian gentleman scientist route</p>
<p>where I was going to be the wealthy person</p>
<p>that was going to go pursue science</p>
<p>and learn about this and do experiments.</p>
<p>And honestly, I&rsquo;m surprised there aren&rsquo;t more people like that</p>
<p>that are like me, technical people that made a bunch of money</p>
<p>and are interested in some of these,</p>
<p>possibly the biggest leverage point in human history.</p>
<p>I mean, I know of, I&rsquo;ve heard of a couple organizations</p>
<p>that are basically led by one rich techie guy</p>
<p>that gets a few people around him to try to work on this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m surprised that there&rsquo;s not more,</p>
<p>that there aren&rsquo;t like a dozen of them.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe people still think that it&rsquo;s an unapproachable problem,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of beyond their ability to get a wrench on</p>
<p>and have some effect on like whatever startups they&rsquo;ve run before.</p>
<p>But that was my kind of, like with all the stuff I&rsquo;ve learned,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s gaming, aerospace, whatever,</p>
<p>I go through a larval phase where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m sucking up all of this information trying to see,</p>
<p>is this something that I can actually do?</p>
<p>Is this something that&rsquo;s practical to devote a large chunk of my life to?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve gone through that with the AI machine learning space of things.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve got my arms around it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the measure of it where some of the most brilliant people</p>
<p>in the world are working on this problem,</p>
<p>but nobody knows exactly the path that it&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re throwing a lot of things at the wall and seeing what sticks.</p>
<p>But I have another interesting thing just learning about all of this,</p>
<p>the contingency of your path to knowledge</p>
<p>and talking about the associations and the context that you have with them</p>
<p>where people that learn in the same path will have similar thought processes.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s useful that I come at this from a different background,</p>
<p>a different history than the people that have had</p>
<p>the largely academic backgrounds for this</p>
<p>where I have huge blind spots that they could easily point out,</p>
<p>but I have a different set of experiences in history</p>
<p>and approaches to problems in systems engineering</p>
<p>that might turn out to be useful.</p>
<p>And I can afford to take that bet where I&rsquo;m not going to be destitute.</p>
<p>I have enough money to fund myself working on this for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>But what I was finding is that I was still not committing</p>
<p>where I had a foot firmly in the VR and meta side of things</p>
<p>where in theory, I&rsquo;ve got a very nice position there.</p>
<p>I only have to work one day a week for my consulting role,</p>
<p>but I was engaging every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d still be like my computer&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be going and checking the workplace and notes</p>
<p>and testing different things and communicating with people.</p>
<p>But I did make the decision recently that I&rsquo;m going to get serious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still going to keep my ties with meta,</p>
<p>but I am seriously going for the AGI side of things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually a really interesting point</p>
<p>because a lot of the machine learning, the AI community is quite large,</p>
<p>but really, basically almost everybody has taken the same trajectory</p>
<p>through life in that community.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so interesting to have somebody like you</p>
<p>with a fundamentally different trajectory,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where the big solutions can come</p>
<p>because there is a kind of silo,</p>
<p>and it is a bunch of people kind of following the same kind of set of ideas.</p>
<p>And I was really worried that I didn&rsquo;t want to come off</p>
<p>as an arrogant outsider for things</p>
<p>where I have all the respect in the world for the work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a miracle decade.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the midst of a scientific revolution happening now,</p>
<p>and everybody doing this is, you know, these are the Einsteins and Boers</p>
<p>and whatevers of our modern era.</p>
<p>And I was really happy to see that the people that I&rsquo;ve sat down and talked with,</p>
<p>everybody does seem to really be quite great about,</p>
<p>just happy to talk about things, willing to acknowledge that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing, we&rsquo;re figuring it out as we go along.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;ve got a huge debt on this where this all really started for me</p>
<p>because Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open AI.</p>
<p>And it was at a point when I didn&rsquo;t know anything about</p>
<p>what was really going on in machine learning.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s funny how the first time you reached out to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like four years ago for your AI podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, for people who are listening to this should know that,</p>
<p>first of all, obviously I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of yours for the longest time,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve agreed to talk like, yeah, like four years ago,</p>
<p>back when this was called the artificial intelligence podcast,</p>
<p>we wanted to do a thing and you said yes.</p>
<p>And I said, it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know anything about modern AI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I said, I could kind of take an angle on machine perception</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m doing a lot of that with the sensors and the virtual reality,</p>
<p>but we could probably find something to talk about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where, when did Sam talk to you about open AI, around the same time?</p>
<p>It was a little bit, it was a bit after that.</p>
<p>So I had done the most basic work, I had kind of done the neural networks</p>
<p>from scratch where I had gone and written it all in C just to make sure</p>
<p>I understood backpropagation at the lowest level and my nuts and bolts approach.</p>
<p>But after Sam approached me, it was flattering to think that he thought</p>
<p>that I could be useful at open AI largely for kind of like systems optimization</p>
<p>sorts of things without being an expert.</p>
<p>But I asked Ilya Sutskever to give me a reading list and he gave me a binder</p>
<p>full of all the papers that like, okay, these are the important things.</p>
<p>If you really read and understand all of these, you&rsquo;ll know like 80% of what most</p>
<p>of the machine language researchers work on.</p>
<p>And I went through and I read all those papers multiple times</p>
<p>and highlighted them and went through and kind of figured the things out there</p>
<p>and then started branching out into my own sets of research on things</p>
<p>and eventually started writing my own experiments and doing kind of figuring out,</p>
<p>you know, finding out what I don&rsquo;t know, what the limits of my knowledge are</p>
<p>and starting to get some of my angles of attack on things,</p>
<p>the things that I think are a little bit different from what people are doing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had a couple of years now, like two years since I kind of left</p>
<p>the full time position at Meta and now I&rsquo;ve kind of pulled the trigger and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get serious about it but some of my lessons all the way back</p>
<p>to Armadillo Aerospace about how I know I need to be more committed to this</p>
<p>where there is that, you know, it&rsquo;s both a freedom and a cost in some ways</p>
<p>when you know that you&rsquo;re wealthy enough to say it&rsquo;s like this doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything.</p>
<p>I can spend, you know, I can spend a million dollars a year for the rest of my life</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But that is an opportunity to just kind of meander</p>
<p>and I could see that in myself when I&rsquo;m doing some things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, this is a kind of interesting, curious thing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this for a little while, let&rsquo;s look at that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really bearing down on the problem.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a few things that I&rsquo;ve done that are kind of tactics for myself</p>
<p>to make me more effective.</p>
<p>Like one thing I noticed I was not doing well is I had a Google Cloud account</p>
<p>to get GPUs there and I was finding I was very rarely doing that</p>
<p>for no good psychological reasons where I&rsquo;m like, oh, I can always think of something to do</p>
<p>other than to spin up instances and run an experiment.</p>
<p>I can keep working on my local Titans or something.</p>
<p>But it was really stupid.</p>
<p>I mean, it was not a lot of money.</p>
<p>I should have been running more experiments there.</p>
<p>So I thought to myself, well, I&rsquo;m going to go buy a quarter million dollar DGX station.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just like sit it right there and it&rsquo;s going to mock me if I&rsquo;m not using it.</p>
<p>If the fans aren&rsquo;t running on that thing, I&rsquo;m not properly utilizing it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been helpful.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve done a lot more experiments since then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s been interesting where I thought I&rsquo;d be doing all this low level</p>
<p>envy link optimized stuff.</p>
<p>But 90 percent of what I do is just spin up four instances of an experiment</p>
<p>with different hyper parameters on it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing like really sort of building up intuition by doing</p>
<p>ML experiments of different kinds.</p>
<p>But so the next big thing, though, is I am you know, I decided that I was going</p>
<p>to take some take some investor money because I have an overactive sense</p>
<p>of responsibility about other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like I I don&rsquo;t want I mean, a lot of my my push and my passionate</p>
<p>entreaties for things that matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t want to have wasted his money investing in Oculus.</p>
<p>I want it to work out.</p>
<p>I want it to change the world.</p>
<p>I want it to be worth all of this time, money and effort going into it.</p>
<p>And I expect that it&rsquo;s going to be that like that with my with my company</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a huge forcing function.</p>
<p>This investment investors that are going to expect something of me now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had the conversation that this is a low probability long term bet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that there&rsquo;s a million things I could do that I would have line</p>
<p>of sight on the value proposition for.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t that I think there are there are unknown unknowns in the way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one of these things that it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s hyperbole.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s potentially one of the most important things humans ever do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that I think is within our lifetimes, if not within a decade</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>So, yeah, this is just now happening.</p>
<p>Like term sheet, like the ink is barely virtually barely dry.</p>
<p>I mean, as I mentioned to you offline, like somebody I admire and somebody</p>
<p>you know, Andre Karpathy, I think the two of you different trajectories in life,</p>
<p>but approach problems similarly in that he calls stuff from scratch up all the time.</p>
<p>And I he&rsquo;s created a bunch of little things outside of even outside the course</p>
<p>at Stanford that have been tremendously useful to build up intuition about stuff,</p>
<p>but also to help people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all in the realm of A.I.</p>
<p>Do you see yourself potentially doing things like this?</p>
<p>You know, not necessarily solving a gigantic problem, but on the journey,</p>
<p>on the path to that building up intuitions and sharing code or ideas or systems</p>
<p>that give inklings of AGI, but also kind of are useful to people in some way.</p>
<p>So, yeah, first of all, Andre is awesome.</p>
<p>I learned a lot when I was going through my larval phase from his blog posts</p>
<p>and his Stanford course and, you know, super valuable.</p>
<p>I got to meet him first a couple of years ago when I was first kind of starting off</p>
<p>on my gentleman scientist bit.</p>
<p>And just just a couple of months ago when he went out on his sabbatical,</p>
<p>he stopped by in Dallas and we talked for a while and I had a great time with him.</p>
<p>And then when I heard he actually left Tesla, I did, of course,</p>
<p>along with a hundred other people say, hey, if you ever want to work with me,</p>
<p>it would be an honor.</p>
<p>So, he thinks that he&rsquo;s going to be doing this educational work,</p>
<p>but I think someone&rsquo;s going to make him an offer he can&rsquo;t refuse</p>
<p>before he gets too far along on it.</p>
<p>Oh, his current interest is educational.</p>
<p>So, yeah, he&rsquo;s a special mind.</p>
<p>Is there something you could speak to what makes him so special?</p>
<p>So, you know, like he did, he was very much a programmer&rsquo;s programmer</p>
<p>that was doing machine learning work rather than,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different feel than an academic where you can see it in paper sometimes</p>
<p>where somebody that&rsquo;s really a mathematician or a statistician at heart</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing something with machine learning.</p>
<p>But, you know, Andre is about getting something done.</p>
<p>And you could see it in like all of his earliest approaches to it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s how reinforcement learning works.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how recurrent neural networks work.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how transformers work.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how crypto works.</p>
<p>And, yeah, it&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s a hacker&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>one of his old posts was like a hacker&rsquo;s guide to machine learning.</p>
<p>And, you know, he deprecated that and said,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really pay attention to what&rsquo;s in here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that thought that carries through in a lot of it</p>
<p>where it is that back again to that hacker mentality</p>
<p>and the hacker ethic with what he&rsquo;s doing and sharing all of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and a lot of his approach to a new thing, like you said,</p>
<p>larva stage is let me code up the simplest possible thing to build up intuition about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I say, I sketch with structs and things.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m just thinking about a problem, I&rsquo;m thinking in some degree of code.</p>
<p>You are also, among many things, a martial artist, both Judo and Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>How has this helped make you the person you are?</p>
<p>So, I mean, I was a competent club player in Judo and grappling.</p>
<p>I mean, I was, you know, by no means any kind of a superstar, but it was,</p>
<p>I went through a few phases with it where I did some when I was quite young,</p>
<p>a little bit more when I was 17.</p>
<p>And then I got into it kind of seriously in my mid 30s.</p>
<p>And, you know, I went pretty far with it.</p>
<p>And I was pretty good at some of the things that I was doing.</p>
<p>And I did appreciate it quite a bit where, I mean, on the one hand,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always if you&rsquo;re going to do exercise or something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a more motivating form of exercise.</p>
<p>If someone is crushing you, you are motivated to do something about that,</p>
<p>to up your attributes and be better about getting out of that.</p>
<p>Up your attributes, yes.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also that sense that I was not a sports guy.</p>
<p>I did do wrestling in junior high.</p>
<p>And I often wish that, I think I would have been good for me</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;d carried that on into high school and had a little bit more of that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like I, you know, filch a little bit of wrestling vibe</p>
<p>with always going on about embracing the grind and like that push</p>
<p>that I associate with the wrestling team that in hindsight,</p>
<p>I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself that way.</p>
<p>But even getting back into Judo and Jiu Jitsu in my mid 30s,</p>
<p>as usually the old man on the mat with that, there was still the, you know,</p>
<p>the sense that, you know, working out with the group</p>
<p>and having the guys that you&rsquo;re beating each other up with it,</p>
<p>but you just feel good coming out of it.</p>
<p>And I can remember those driving home aching in various ways</p>
<p>and just thinking, it&rsquo;s like, oh, that was really great.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s mixing with a bunch of people that had nothing to do</p>
<p>with any of the things that I worked with.</p>
<p>You know, every once in a while, someone would be like,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re the Doom guy.</p>
<p>But for the most part, it was just different slice of life.</p>
<p>You know, a good thing.</p>
<p>And I made the call when I was 40.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, maybe I&rsquo;m getting a little old for this.</p>
<p>I had separated a rib and tweaked a few things.</p>
<p>And I got out of it without any really bad injuries.</p>
<p>And it was like, have I dodged enough bullets?</p>
<p>Should I, you know, should I hang it up?</p>
<p>I went back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone a couple of times in the last decade</p>
<p>trying to get my kids into it a little bit.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really stick with any of them,</p>
<p>but it was fun to get back on the mats.</p>
<p>It really hurts for a while when you haven&rsquo;t gone for a while.</p>
<p>But I still debate this pretty constantly.</p>
<p>My brother&rsquo;s only a year younger than me,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going kind of hard in jiu jitsu right now.</p>
<p>You know, he won a few medals at the last tournament he was at.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s competing, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I was thinking, yeah, I guess we&rsquo;re in the executive division</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re over 50 or over 45 or something.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not out of the question that I go back at some point to do some of this.</p>
<p>But again, I&rsquo;m just reorganizing my life around more focus.</p>
<p>Probably not going to happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pushing my exercise around to give me a longer,</p>
<p>uninterrupted intellectual focus time,</p>
<p>pushing it to the beginning or the end of the game.</p>
<p>Like running and stuff like that, walking.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got running and calisthenics and some things like that.</p>
<p>It allows you to still think about a problem.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to a judo club or something, you&rsquo;ve got it fixed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be 7 o clock or whatever, 10 o clock on Saturday.</p>
<p>Although, I talked about this a little bit when I was on Rogan.</p>
<p>And shortly after that, Carlos Machado did reach out.</p>
<p>And I had trained with him for years back in the day.</p>
<p>And he was like, hey, we&rsquo;ve got kind of a small private club</p>
<p>with a bunch of executive type people.</p>
<p>And it does tempt me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if you know him, but John Donahart moved here to Austin</p>
<p>with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks.</p>
<p>He has a very interesting way, very deep systematic way of thinking about jiu jitsu</p>
<p>that reveals the chest of it, the science of it.</p>
<p>And I do think about that more as kind of an older person</p>
<p>considering the martial arts where I can remember the very earliest days</p>
<p>getting back into judo and I&rsquo;m like, teach me submissions right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, learn the arm bar, learn the choke.</p>
<p>But as you get older, you start thinking more about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, I really do want to like learn the entire canon of judo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all the different things there and like all the different approaches for it.</p>
<p>Not just the, you know, if you want to compete,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a handful of things you learn really, really well.</p>
<p>But sometimes there&rsquo;s interest in learning a little bit more of the scope there</p>
<p>and figuring some things out from, you know, at one point I had wasn&rsquo;t exactly a spreadsheet,</p>
<p>but I did have a big long text file with like, here&rsquo;s the things that I learned</p>
<p>and here are like ways you chain this together.</p>
<p>And while, when I went back a few years ago,</p>
<p>it was good to see that I whipped myself back into reasonable shape</p>
<p>about doing the basic grappling.</p>
<p>But I know there was a ton of the subtleties that were just, that were gone,</p>
<p>but could probably be brought back reasonably quickly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also the benefit.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re exceptionally successful now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>And the problem, the old problem of the ego.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I still pushed kind of harder than I should.</p>
<p>I mean, that was, I was one of those people that I, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the smaller side for a lot of the people competing and I would, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go with all the big guys and I&rsquo;d go hard and I&rsquo;d push myself a lot.</p>
<p>And that would be one of those where I would, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be dangerous to anyone for the first five minutes,</p>
<p>but then sometimes after that I&rsquo;m already dead.</p>
<p>And I knew it was terrible for me because it made the, you know,</p>
<p>it meant I got less training time with all of that when you go and you just gas</p>
<p>out relatively quickly there.</p>
<p>And I like to think that I would be better about that where after I gave up judo,</p>
<p>I started doing the half marathons and tough butters and things like that.</p>
<p>And so when I did go back to the local judokai club, I thought it&rsquo;s like, oh,</p>
<p>I should have better cardio for this because I&rsquo;m a runner now and I do all of</p>
<p>this and didn&rsquo;t work out that way.</p>
<p>It was the same old thing where just push really hard, strain really hard.</p>
<p>And of course, when I worked with good guys like Carlos, it&rsquo;s like just the</p>
<p>whole flow like water thing is real and he&rsquo;s just like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true with judo too.</p>
<p>Some of the best people like I&rsquo;ve trained with Olympic gold medalists and for</p>
<p>some reason with them, everything&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>Everything is you actually start to feel the science of it, the music of it,</p>
<p>the dance of it.</p>
<p>Everything is effortless.</p>
<p>You understand that there&rsquo;s an art to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an exercise.</p>
<p>It was interesting where I did go to the Kodokan in Japan.</p>
<p>I kind of the birthplace of judo and everything.</p>
<p>And I remember I rolled with one old guy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t start standing, just started on groundwork and it was and it</p>
<p>was striking how different it was from Carlos.</p>
<p>He was still he was better than me and he got my arm and I had to tap there.</p>
<p>But it was a completely different style where I just felt like I could do</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p>He was just enveloping me and just like slowly grounded down with my arm and</p>
<p>bent it while with Carlos, you know, he&rsquo;s just loose and free.</p>
<p>And you always thought like, oh, you&rsquo;re just going to go grab something.</p>
<p>But you never had any chance to do it.</p>
<p>But it was very different feeling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good summary of the difference between jiu jitsu and judo and jiu</p>
<p>jitsu.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s it is a dance and you feel like there&rsquo;s a freedom and actually anybody</p>
<p>like the Gordon Ryan, one of the best the best grappler in the world.</p>
<p>Nogi grappler in the world. There&rsquo;s a feeling like you can do anything.</p>
<p>But when you actually try to do something, you can&rsquo;t just magically doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>But with the best judo players in the world, it does feel like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>blanket that weighs a thousand pounds on top of you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a feeling like you can do anything.</p>
<p>You just you&rsquo;re trapped.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a style that&rsquo;s a difference in the style of martial</p>
<p>arts. But it&rsquo;s also once you start to study, you understand it all has to</p>
<p>do with human movement and the physics of it and the leverage and all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s super fascinating.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, for me, the biggest benefits and the humbling</p>
<p>aspect when another human being kind of tells you that, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a hierarchy or there&rsquo;s a you&rsquo;re not that special.</p>
<p>And in the most extreme case, when you tap to a choke, you are basically</p>
<p>living because somebody let you live.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that is one of those.</p>
<p>If you think about it, that is a closer brush with mortality than than most</p>
<p>people consider.</p>
<p>And that kind of humbling act is good to take to your work then where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>harder to get humbled.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s nobody that does any martial art is coming out thinking I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>best in the world at anything because everybody loses.</p>
<p>Let me ask you for advice.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today about life, about career,</p>
<p>how they can have a job, how they can have an impact, how they can have a</p>
<p>life they could be proud of.</p>
<p>So it was kind of fun.</p>
<p>I got invited to give the commencement speech back at the I went to college</p>
<p>for two semesters and dropped out and went on to do my tech stuff.</p>
<p>But they still wanted me to come back and give a commencement speech.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got that pinned on my Twitter account.</p>
<p>I still feel good about everything that I said there.</p>
<p>And my biggest point was that the path for me might not be the path for</p>
<p>everyone.</p>
<p>And in fact, the advice, the path that I took and even the advice that I</p>
<p>would give based on my experience and learnings probably isn&rsquo;t the best</p>
<p>advice for everyone.</p>
<p>Because what I did was all about this knowledge in depth.</p>
<p>It was about not just having this surface level ability to make things do</p>
<p>what I want, but to really understand them through and through.</p>
<p>To let me do the systems engineering work and to sometimes find these</p>
<p>inefficiencies that can be bypassed.</p>
<p>And the whole world doesn&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>Most programmers or engineers of any kind don&rsquo;t necessarily need to do that.</p>
<p>They need to do a little job that&rsquo;s been parceled out to them.</p>
<p>Be reliable.</p>
<p>Let people depend on you.</p>
<p>Do quality work with all of that.</p>
<p>But people that do have an inclination for wanting to know things deeper and</p>
<p>learn things deeper, there are just layers and layers of things out there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the right person that is excited about that, the world&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>been like this before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than ever.</p>
<p>I mean, everything that was wonderful for me is still there, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whole new worlds to explore on the different things that you can do.</p>
<p>And that, you know, it&rsquo;s hard work.</p>
<p>Embrace the grind with it.</p>
<p>And understand as much as you can.</p>
<p>And then be prepared for opportunities to present themselves.</p>
<p>Where you can&rsquo;t just say this is my goal in life and just push at that.</p>
<p>I mean, you might be able to do that, but you&rsquo;re going to make more total</p>
<p>progress if you say I&rsquo;m preparing myself with this broad set of tools.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m being aware of all the way things are changing as I move through</p>
<p>the world and as the whole world changes around me.</p>
<p>And then looking for opportunities to deploy the tools that you&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be more and more of those types of things there where an</p>
<p>awareness of what&rsquo;s happening, where the inefficiencies are, what things can</p>
<p>be done, what&rsquo;s possible versus what&rsquo;s current practice.</p>
<p>And then finding those areas where you can go and make an adjustment and make</p>
<p>something that may affect millions or billions of people in the world.</p>
<p>Make it better.</p>
<p>When, maybe from your own example, how were you able to recognize this about</p>
<p>yourself that you saw the layers in a particular thing and you were drawn to</p>
<p>discovering deeper and deeper truths about it?</p>
<p>Is that something that was obvious to you that you couldn&rsquo;t help or is there some</p>
<p>actions you had to take to actually allow yourself to dig deep?</p>
<p>So in the earliest days of personal computers, I remember the reference</p>
<p>manuals and the very early ones even had schematics of computers in the</p>
<p>background, in the back of the books, as well as firmware listings and things.</p>
<p>And I could look at that.</p>
<p>And at that time, when I was a younger teenager, I didn&rsquo;t understand a lot of</p>
<p>that stuff, how the different things worked.</p>
<p>I was pulling out the information that I could get, but I always wanted to know</p>
<p>all of that.</p>
<p>There was kind of magical information sitting down there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the elder lore that some gray beard wizard is the keeper of.</p>
<p>And so I always felt that pull for wanting to know more, wanting to explore</p>
<p>the mysterious areas there.</p>
<p>And that followed right in through all the things that got the value,</p>
<p>exploring the video cards leading to the scrolling advantages,</p>
<p>exploring some of the academic papers and things, learning about BSP trees</p>
<p>and the different things that I could do with those systems and just the huge</p>
<p>larval phases going through aerospace, just reading bookshelves full of books.</p>
<p>Again, that point where I have enough money, I can buy all the books I want.</p>
<p>It was so valuable there where I was terrible with my money when I was a kid.</p>
<p>My mom thought I would always be broke because I&rsquo;d buy my comic books</p>
<p>and just be out of money.</p>
<p>But it was like all the pizza I want, all the Diet Coke I want,</p>
<p>video games and then books.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t take that much.</p>
<p>As soon as I was making 27K a year, I felt rich and I was just getting</p>
<p>all the things that I wanted.</p>
<p>But that sense of books have always been magical to me.</p>
<p>And that was one of the things that really made me smile is Andre had said</p>
<p>when he came over to my house, he said he found my library inspiring.</p>
<p>And it was great to see.</p>
<p>I used to look at him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of a younger guy.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if younger people these days have the same relationship</p>
<p>with books that I do where they were such a cornerstone for me in so many ways.</p>
<p>But that sense that, yeah, I always wanted to know it all.</p>
<p>I know I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that was like one of the last things I said.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t know everything, but you should convince yourself</p>
<p>that you can know anything.</p>
<p>Any one particular thing, it was created and discovered by humans.</p>
<p>You can learn it.</p>
<p>You can find out what you need on there.</p>
<p>And you can learn it deeply.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you can drive a nail down through whatever layer cake problem space</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got and learn a cross section there.</p>
<p>And not only can you have an impact doing that,</p>
<p>you can attain happiness doing that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something so fulfilling about becoming a craftsman of a thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to tell people that, look, this is a good career move.</p>
<p>Just grit your teeth and bear it.</p>
<p>You want people.</p>
<p>And I do think it is possible sometimes to find the joy in something.</p>
<p>Like it might not immediately appeal to you.</p>
<p>But I had told people early on, like in software times,</p>
<p>that a lot of game developers are in it just because they</p>
<p>are so passionate about games.</p>
<p>But I was always really more flexible in what appealed to me,</p>
<p>where I said, I think I could be quite engaged doing</p>
<p>operating system work or even database work.</p>
<p>I would find the interest in that.</p>
<p>Because I think most things that are significant in the world</p>
<p>have a lot of layers and complexity to them</p>
<p>and a lot of opportunities hidden within them.</p>
<p>So that would probably be the most important thing to encourage to people</p>
<p>is that you can weaponize curiosity.</p>
<p>You can deploy your curiosity to find,</p>
<p>to kind of like make things useful and valuable to you,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t immediately appear that way.</p>
<p>Deploy your curiosity.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned this debate point,</p>
<p>whether mortality or fear of mortality is fundamental to creating an AGI.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about whether it&rsquo;s fundamental to human beings.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And you probably always have to like take with a grain of salt</p>
<p>anything somebody says about fundamental things like that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think about really aging, impending death,</p>
<p>having a legacy with my children, things like that.</p>
<p>And clearly it seems most of the world does a lot more than I do.</p>
<p>So I mean I think I&rsquo;m an outlier in that where it doesn&rsquo;t wind up</p>
<p>being a real part of my thinking and motivation about things.</p>
<p>So daily existence is about sort of the people you love</p>
<p>and the problems before you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m focused on what I&rsquo;m working on right now.</p>
<p>I do take that back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one aspect where the kind of finiteness of the life does impact me,</p>
<p>and that is about thinking about the scope of the problems that I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>When I decided to work on it, when I was like nuclear fission or AGI,</p>
<p>these are big ticket things that impact large fractions of the world.</p>
<p>And I was thinking to myself at some level that, okay,</p>
<p>I may have a couple more swings at bat with me at full capability,</p>
<p>but yes, my mental abilities will decay with age, mostly inevitably.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a 0% chance that we will address some of that</p>
<p>before it becomes a problem for me.</p>
<p>I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades.</p>
<p>But I do have this kind of vague plan that when I&rsquo;m not at the top of my game</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t feel that I&rsquo;m in a position to put a dent in the world some way,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll probably wind up doing some kind of recreational retro programming</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll work on something that I would not devote my life to now,</p>
<p>but I can while away my time as the old man gardening in the code worlds.</p>
<p>And then to step back even bigger, let me ask you about why we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>we human beings.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life, John Carmack?</p>
<p>So very similar with that last question.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people fret about this question a lot,</p>
<p>and I just really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>We are biological creatures that happenstance of evolution.</p>
<p>We have innate drives that evolution crafted for survival</p>
<p>and passing on of genetic codes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find a lot of value in trying to go much deeper than that.</p>
<p>I have my motivations, some of which are probably genetically coded</p>
<p>and many of which are contingent on my upbringing</p>
<p>and the path that I&rsquo;ve had through my life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t run into like spades of depression or envy</p>
<p>or anything that winds up being a challenge</p>
<p>and forcing a degree of soul searching with things like that.</p>
<p>I seem to be okay kind of without that.</p>
<p>As a brilliant ant in the ant colony without looking up to the sky</p>
<p>wondering why the hell am I here again.</p>
<p>So the why of it, the incredible mystery of the fact that we started,</p>
<p>first of all, the origin of life on Earth,</p>
<p>and from that, from single cell organisms,</p>
<p>the entirety of the evolutionary process took us somehow</p>
<p>to this incredibly intelligent thing that is able to build Wolfenstein 3D</p>
<p>and Doom and Quake and take a crack at the problem of AGI</p>
<p>and things that eventually supersede human beings.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t, the why of it is&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been my experience that people that focus on,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t focus on the here and now right in front of them</p>
<p>tend to be less effective.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not 100%, you know, vision matters to some people,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a necessary motivator for me</p>
<p>and I think that the process of getting there is usually done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the magic of gradient descent.</p>
<p>People just don&rsquo;t believe that just looking locally</p>
<p>gets you to all of these spectacular things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been, you know, the decades of looking at</p>
<p>really some of the smartest people in the world</p>
<p>that would just push back forever against this idea</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not this grand, sophisticated vision of everything,</p>
<p>but little tiny steps, local information winds up</p>
<p>leading to all the best answers.</p>
<p>So the meaning of life is following locally</p>
<p>wherever the gradient descent takes you.</p>
<p>This was an incredible conversation,</p>
<p>officially the longest conversation I&rsquo;ve ever done on the podcast,</p>
<p>which means a lot to me because I get to do it with one of my heroes.</p>
<p>John, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much it means to me</p>
<p>that you would sit down with me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait what you do next, but you&rsquo;ve already changed the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an inspiration to so many people.</p>
<p>And again, we haven&rsquo;t covered like most of what I was planning to talk about,</p>
<p>so I hope we get a chance to talk someday in the future.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do next.</p>
<p>Thank you so much again for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Carmack.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from John Carmack himself.</p>
<p>Focused hard work is the real key to success.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes on the goal,</p>
<p>and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure which way to do something,</p>
<p>do it both ways and see which works better.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
