    <p>Our card this week is Donna Tattersall, the Queen of Spades from Rhode Island.</p>
<p>In 1979, 24-year-old Donna was found dead behind a bar,</p>
<p>a bar that she was seen alone at just hours earlier.</p>
<p>Thanks to eyewitnesses, police quickly zeroed in on a promising suspect.</p>
<p>But when the case went to trial, they learned things weren&rsquo;t as straightforward as they</p>
<p>seemed.</p>
<p>For more than 40 years, the sexual assault and murder of Donna Tattersall has haunted</p>
<p>the people of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, as they wait for the monster who committed such</p>
<p>a heinous crime to be held accountable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On April 22, 1979, before Sunday&rsquo;s service began, a reverend in Pawtucket, Rhode Island</p>
<p>was taking a stroll in the alleyway beside his church.</p>
<p>As he approached the back of the building, something caught his eye in the grassy lawn</p>
<p>behind the Firehouse Lounge, which was a popular bar that sat right behind the church.</p>
<p>It was a woman.</p>
<p>She looked like she had passed out after a long night of drinking, sprawled out on the</p>
<p>ground, so the reverend called police.</p>
<p>But when the responding officer arrived at around 10 a.m., it was clear that the situation</p>
<p>was actually much more serious than that.</p>
<p>The woman on the ground was only half-clothed, and she wasn&rsquo;t passed out.</p>
<p>She was dead.</p>
<p>Because she was only partially clothed and had some bruising, it was clear right away</p>
<p>that foul play was involved.</p>
<p>Within minutes, the area was closed off and was swarming with detectives, patrol officers,</p>
<p>and the medical examiner.</p>
<p>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, one of the patrol officers piped up and said that he knew the</p>
<p>woman.</p>
<p>In fact, he&rsquo;d just seen her the previous night when he was working patrol at the Firehouse</p>
<p>Lounge.</p>
<p>He knew her name was Donna, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure of her last name.</p>
<p>He said Donna had been sitting at the bar by herself for the majority of the evening,</p>
<p>and the last time he recalled seeing her was around 12.45 a.m., when she was standing by</p>
<p>the cigarette machine, still alone.</p>
<p>Two more officers said they&rsquo;d seen Donna at the bar that night, too, but none of them</p>
<p>seemed to recall seeing anything suspicious or even anything useful.</p>
<p>Donna wasn&rsquo;t with anyone, she wasn&rsquo;t getting harassed by anyone, or getting into</p>
<p>any fights.</p>
<p>Nothing that would have led to her ending up dead just a few feet away from where she</p>
<p>was enjoying a night out just hours earlier.</p>
<p>So police went to the public, seeking tips.</p>
<p>They were hoping to find someone who could help them piece together what had happened</p>
<p>to Donna between the last sighting of her inside the bar, seemingly having a good time,</p>
<p>and then her ending up dead behind the building.</p>
<p>And a tipster actually came forward right away, giving them exactly what they were looking</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>26-year-old Pawtucket resident Frank Hallworth was listening to the radio on April 22nd when</p>
<p>he heard reports of what police had discovered.</p>
<p>He heard authorities please for anyone with information to come forward, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when it clicked.</p>
<p>What he was hearing on the radio must have been directly related to that disturbing thing</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d seen the night before.</p>
<p>Frank called police and told them that on the evening of April 21st, he was at the firehouse</p>
<p>lounge having a good time, sipping a drink, and just kind of mingling, when a large man</p>
<p>bumped into him and made him spill his drink all over himself.</p>
<p>Now this wasn&rsquo;t enough to make Frank like super angry or anything, or maybe he was just</p>
<p>intimidated by this guy because of his size, but it was certainly annoying.</p>
<p>And memorable.</p>
<p>Frank told police that the guy who bumped him was no stranger.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Sue Cormier.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s with the Pawtucket Police Department, and she&rsquo;s working the case today.</p>
<p>He said that he recognized the person from the area and from the bar.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know his full name, but he said his nickname was something like Buzz or Buzzy.</p>
<p>After the spill incident, the night continued on rather uneventfully, and Frank said that</p>
<p>he left the bar at around 1.15 a.m.</p>
<p>He told police that he hopped in his car, and as he was heading home, he drove back</p>
<p>past the bar, and that&rsquo;s when he saw the man who had bumped into him earlier.</p>
<p>Buzz was walking out of the firehouse lounge and into the alley beside the bar, and he</p>
<p>was carrying something.</p>
<p>Frank called out to him something like, hey man, and when he did, Buzz started walking</p>
<p>much faster toward the alley.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when Frank realized Buzz wasn&rsquo;t carrying something, he was carrying someone.</p>
<p>It was a woman that he was holding in like a bear hug.</p>
<p>But Frank said that he honestly didn&rsquo;t think too much of it at the time.</p>
<p>Now, you might have the same reaction I did when I first heard this, like how do you not</p>
<p>immediately know something is wrong when you see a man carrying a woman down a dark alley?</p>
<p>But Frank said that he just assumed that the woman was drunk.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;d seen Buzz at the bar earlier that night, so he assumed the woman had been</p>
<p>there as well, maybe had a bit too much to drink, and she needed help getting home.</p>
<p>Frank also noted that the woman wasn&rsquo;t screaming or making any kind of commotion, so he just</p>
<p>thought that Buzz knew her and was trying to be a nice guy.</p>
<p>But Frank&rsquo;s rather innocent justification melted away when he heard the report on the</p>
<p>radio of a woman being found behind the bar.</p>
<p>Now while police were trying to figure out what Buzz&rsquo;s real name was so they could</p>
<p>interview him, the medical examiner&rsquo;s office was finishing up Donna&rsquo;s autopsy.</p>
<p>The ME found that she&rsquo;d been strangled, likely by hand, and sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Her toxicology showed that she had a lot of alcohol in her system, which I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>was no surprise to anyone since she&rsquo;d just spent the entire evening at a bar.</p>
<p>As news of Donna&rsquo;s murder spread, more and more witnesses started calling in.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Cormier again.</p>
<p>She was seen by several people that night.</p>
<p>It appears that she was in there for several hours and was drinking quite a bit.</p>
<p>Some people who saw her in the bar that night said she was drunk, but not to the point that</p>
<p>she wouldn&rsquo;t know who she was with.</p>
<p>Once police had spoken with the family, friends, and people who&rsquo;d seen her at the bar, they</p>
<p>nailed down a timeline of Donna&rsquo;s movements the night before her body was found.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d arrived at the Firehouse Lounge sometime before 8 p.m., and she sat at the bar drinking</p>
<p>by herself for a few hours.</p>
<p>There was a live band that night, and Donna seemed to be enjoying the music.</p>
<p>And by the way, the Firehouse Lounge wasn&rsquo;t some little dive bar, it&rsquo;s this huge place</p>
<p>with multiple levels and a big dance floor and stages for bands.</p>
<p>At some point during the evening, Donna was seen talking with a group of people.</p>
<p>Then later that night was when the officer saw her standing by the cigarette machine alone.</p>
<p>And around 1.15 a.m. is when she was seen leaving the bar, but not alone, and not of</p>
<p>her own volition.</p>
<p>Just like Frank had told police, other patrons reported seeing Donna leave with a big, tall</p>
<p>man being carried by him, in fact.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the officers who were there at the bar on duty that night witnessed</p>
<p>this, which surprised me, but maybe they were making rounds through the crowds when Donna</p>
<p>was taken out of the doors, maybe they weren&rsquo;t paying attention, who knows?</p>
<p>Either way, now that several other people had confirmed Frank&rsquo;s initial statement,</p>
<p>investigators were sure that this mystery man existed and likely had something to do</p>
<p>with Donna&rsquo;s murder, but they still needed to figure out his identity.</p>
<p>So they called up their initial tipster, Frank, and asked him to come down to the station</p>
<p>and look at a photo lineup to see if he could ID the man that he saw carrying Donna that</p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>And sure enough, he could.</p>
<p>Frank confidently pointed to a photo of the man that he saw that night who he knew as</p>
<p>Buzz.</p>
<p>It was 20-year-old David Bland.</p>
<p>Within a few days, police had tracked down David, or Buzz as he was known, but there</p>
<p>was one small problem.</p>
<p>Even though he was their prime suspect, he had an alibi.</p>
<p>Buzz told investigators that he couldn&rsquo;t have been the guy seen carrying Donna out</p>
<p>of the bar in the wee hours of the morning on April 22nd because he wasn&rsquo;t even in</p>
<p>town that night.</p>
<p>He told police that he was in Providence, about a 10-minute drive away at a bar called</p>
<p>Lupo&rsquo;s Heartbreak Hotel.</p>
<p>Buzz also said that he&rsquo;d never even seen Donna or interacted with her before in his</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>But investigators weren&rsquo;t buying his story, partially because his body was covered in</p>
<p>marks consistent with someone trying to fight him off.</p>
<p>There were noticeable scratches and cuts on his legs, but Buzz had an easy explanation</p>
<p>for those scrapes.</p>
<p>He said that while he was at Lupo&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;d gotten into a fight with some guy.</p>
<p>As suspicious as they were of Buzz, police let him go since they didn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>probable cause to arrest him.</p>
<p>That is, until police set out to try and confirm his alibi.</p>
<p>They interviewed 22-year-old Manuel Pimentel, a good friend of Buzz&rsquo;s, and Manuel claimed</p>
<p>that he was out with Buzz that night, but the story he told police completely contradicted</p>
<p>the tale Buzz had told.</p>
<p>Manuel said that he was taking a taxi cab from Providence to Pawtucket when he spotted</p>
<p>a friend of his, Buzz, and Buzz was standing on the side of the road, appearing to be having</p>
<p>car trouble.</p>
<p>Wanting to help a friend, Manuel had the taxi driver pull up to the broken-down car and</p>
<p>pick up his friend.</p>
<p>Buzz hopped in, and then he and Manuel took the cab to Pawtucket, specifically to a restaurant</p>
<p>called Howard Johnson&rsquo;s, where they got milkshakes and french fries.</p>
<p>Once they finished at the restaurant, the night was still young, so they agreed to go</p>
<p>to a popular nearby bar, the Firehouse Lounge.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s more, Manuel confirmed that they actually saw Donna at the bar.</p>
<p>Now Manuel says that he wasn&rsquo;t at the bar too long because he decided to go to another</p>
<p>pub with his other friend.</p>
<p>They invited Buzz to join them, but Manuel said he declined.</p>
<p>Manuel estimated that he and his other friend left the Firehouse Lounge at around 1245 in</p>
<p>the morning, and that&rsquo;s the last that he saw of Buzz that night.</p>
<p>Police showed Manuel a photo array to see if he could identify his friend Buzz, who</p>
<p>he picked up in the taxi that evening.</p>
<p>And sure enough, he pointed to the picture of David Beland.</p>
<p>Police also reached out to Lupo&rsquo;s Heartbreak Hotel to see if they could talk to the doorman</p>
<p>who was working the evening of April 21st.</p>
<p>And just as they suspected, when police located the employee and showed him a picture of Buzz,</p>
<p>he said that he&rsquo;d never seen that guy before in his life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the doorman said that on the night in question, there was only one fight</p>
<p>that he knew of that went down at Lupo&rsquo;s, and it certainly didn&rsquo;t involve the guy in</p>
<p>the photo.</p>
<p>So now, armed with Frank&rsquo;s statement, along with Manuel&rsquo;s story and the doorman&rsquo;s account,</p>
<p>investigators were more confident than ever that Buzz was their guy.</p>
<p>I mean, police didn&rsquo;t really have any other viable suspects or even persons of interest.</p>
<p>All signs were pointing toward Buzz.</p>
<p>And Donna wasn&rsquo;t the kind of person who had a long list of enemies.</p>
<p>By all accounts, it seems she was very well liked.</p>
<p>You know, nobody has a bad word to say about her.</p>
<p>Just kind of your average 20-something-year-old kid, and I say kid because that just seems</p>
<p>so young to me.</p>
<p>And, you know, to have her life taken from her like that, she was just out to have a</p>
<p>fun time, you know, at a local bar with friends or even just by herself.</p>
<p>She obviously felt comfortable enough being there, whether she was by herself or ran into</p>
<p>other people from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Everybody seemed to kind of know each other a lot back then, you know, from the city and</p>
<p>neighboring towns.</p>
<p>In order to avoid getting tunnel vision for Buzz, police did all the routine interviews</p>
<p>with Donna&rsquo;s friends and family members to make sure she hadn&rsquo;t been targeted by someone</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>Investigators learned that Donna lived most of her life in Lincoln, a smaller town just</p>
<p>five miles outside of Pawtucket.</p>
<p>She then moved to Pawtucket in 1978, just one year before her death.</p>
<p>She was between jobs and shared an apartment with a random roommate who didn&rsquo;t know Donna</p>
<p>very well.</p>
<p>But Detective Cormier said that Donna&rsquo;s family was well-known and well-liked within the Providence</p>
<p>County area.</p>
<p>The more police learned about Donna, the less likely it seemed that anyone had it out for</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>And the more likely it seemed that the only scenario that made sense was that she was</p>
<p>killed by their prime suspect, Buzz.</p>
<p>Authorities knew that they could place Buzz at the firehouse lounge at around the time</p>
<p>Donna was killed, and they also had a witness who actually saw Buzz carrying Donna down</p>
<p>the alley.</p>
<p>So you might imagine they were pretty confident that they&rsquo;d win in a jury trial.</p>
<p>That is, if Buzz didn&rsquo;t just confess or plead guilty first.</p>
<p>But Buzz wasn&rsquo;t flipping.</p>
<p>So not long after that, he was formally charged with first-degree murder, and Rhode Island</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Maureen McKenna prepared to bring the state&rsquo;s case against</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Buzz&rsquo;s trial was held in Providence at the Superior Court with a jury of seven women</p>
<p>and five men.</p>
<p>The state presented their case first with a solid lineup of witnesses, Manuel, Frank,</p>
<p>the ME, and others.</p>
<p>Manuel was called to the stand first, and he told the court the same story that he told</p>
<p>police when he was initially interviewed.</p>
<p>He was taking a taxi, he spotted Buzz on the side of the road, and asked the taxi driver</p>
<p>to pick him up.</p>
<p>Manuel testified that Buzz didn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;d been in a fight, which the prosecutor</p>
<p>used as a way to prove that Buzz&rsquo;s injuries must have occurred later, perhaps while he</p>
<p>was assaulting Donna.</p>
<p>Manuel went on to say that after he picked him up, they went to the popular restaurant</p>
<p>and then ended up at Firehouse Lounge to, quote, pick up a couple of broads, end quote.</p>
<p>Manuel noted that Buzz reeked of liquor and was having trouble walking straight.</p>
<p>According to local coverage of the trial, Manuel described Buzz as, quote-unquote, bombed.</p>
<p>Now remember, Buzz initially completely denied ever even being at the bar the evening that</p>
<p>Donna was killed.</p>
<p>And it was important for the prosecution to prove that Buzz&rsquo;s initial story was a lie,</p>
<p>that he was at the Firehouse Lounge that night, not at Lupo&rsquo;s, as he had claimed.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s the thing, if he was flat out lying about that, what else was he hiding?</p>
<p>As a mudslinging tactic, Buzz&rsquo;s attorney, Joseph Caponieri, made sure that the jury</p>
<p>knew that Manuel had a criminal record.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d previously been convicted of breaking and entering and larceny.</p>
<p>The judge told the jury that just because someone has a criminal record doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not telling the truth.</p>
<p>But he did let them know that it was something that they could take into consideration when</p>
<p>evaluating the credibility of a witness.</p>
<p>Now to further prove that Buzz was lying, the prosecution called the doorman at Lupo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to the stand.</p>
<p>He told the jury then exactly what he told police, he&rsquo;d never seen Buzz at Lupo&rsquo;s before.</p>
<p>And Buzz certainly didn&rsquo;t get into a fight at the bar that night, as he had claimed.</p>
<p>The prosecution had done their best to prove that Buzz was lying about where he&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>that night.</p>
<p>But they still needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Buzz was the one who strangled</p>
<p>Donna.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where Frank came in.</p>
<p>Frank got on the stand and recounted to the jury what he&rsquo;d seen that evening, Buzz carrying</p>
<p>Donna down the alleyway in what he described as a bear hug, and then picking up his pace</p>
<p>when Frank called out to him.</p>
<p>Finally, the prosecution called to the stand the M.E., Dr. Anthony Burns.</p>
<p>He testified to the findings of the autopsy and the fact that there was evidence to support</p>
<p>that Donna had the pressure of hands on her neck.</p>
<p>He was asked if the neck injuries could have been from an impact such as a fall, perhaps</p>
<p>meaning that Donna&rsquo;s death was an accident, but Dr. Burns said there was no way her injuries</p>
<p>were sustained from a fall.</p>
<p>When it was the defense&rsquo;s turn to call witnesses, the first person Buzz&rsquo;s attorney called to</p>
<p>the stand was actually a bit surprising.</p>
<p>It was Buzz himself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common for attorneys to discourage their clients from testifying at their own hearing</p>
<p>for fear that they might say something incriminating on the stand or melt under the pressure of</p>
<p>cross-examination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear if Joseph Kapaneri discouraged Buzz from testifying or not, but whatever</p>
<p>the case, Buzz was now taking the stand in his own defense, and it&rsquo;s obvious from the</p>
<p>headlines in 1980 that local newspapers were eating it up.</p>
<p>Some reports from the Providence Journal stated that, just like he had months prior when police</p>
<p>were questioning him, Buzz recounted to the court his whereabouts on the evening of April</p>
<p>21st through the early morning hours of the 22nd.</p>
<p>Only this time, his story was different.</p>
<p>According to those same local newspaper reports, Buzz told the jury that he was not drunk that</p>
<p>night as Manuel had suggested.</p>
<p>And despite the testimony of the doorman, Buzz said that he was at Lupo&rsquo;s that evening.</p>
<p>He said he had one or two beers and then left after getting in a scuffle, again contradicting</p>
<p>what the doorman who was working that night said.</p>
<p>After leaving Lupo&rsquo;s, Buzz said that his car stalled on Interstate 95, where he was</p>
<p>picked up by his friend Manuel in the taxi cab.</p>
<p>Buzz now said that the two of them went to a local restaurant for a shake and fries and</p>
<p>then dropped by the Firehouse Lounge.</p>
<p>But where his story diverges from Manuel&rsquo;s is that Buzz says after he was at the bar</p>
<p>for just a few minutes, he decided to walk home.</p>
<p>He flat out denied ever seeing Frank at the bar that evening or bumping into him, and</p>
<p>he swore up and down that he didn&rsquo;t know Donna at all and didn&rsquo;t so much as see her</p>
<p>that night, let alone kill her.</p>
<p>But Buzz didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>He said that he couldn&rsquo;t have sexually assaulted Donna because he was unable to have sex due</p>
<p>to a sexually transmitted disease that he was battling.</p>
<p>After Buzz testified, the next witness he called to the stand was a woman named Denise.</p>
<p>She says that she was upstairs at Lupo&rsquo;s Heartbreak Hotel in Providence on the evening of the</p>
<p>21st when she saw Buzz walking in.</p>
<p>Once again, this conflicted with the doorman&rsquo;s testimony that he&rsquo;d never seen Buzz in his</p>
<p>life and that he wasn&rsquo;t at the establishment that night.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, Denise didn&rsquo;t just tell the jury that she&rsquo;d seen Buzz.</p>
<p>She actually said she went up and talked to him for about five minutes.</p>
<p>She said that Buzz showed no signs of being inebriated, which, again, contradicted Manuel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>testimony that Buzz was completely wasted.</p>
<p>After this, the defense pretty much rested their case, and it was time for closing arguments.</p>
<p>Mr. McKenna was up first, and she reminded the jury of Buzz&rsquo;s pattern of lies, his</p>
<p>changing story of where he was the night that Donna was killed.</p>
<p>And she also argued that Buzz&rsquo;s sexual condition wouldn&rsquo;t have prevented him from forcing</p>
<p>himself on Donna as Buzz had insinuated on the stand.</p>
<p>She agreed that sexually assaulting Donna might have been painful for Buzz, but not</p>
<p>impossible, especially if he was drunk like Manuel had testified.</p>
<p>In Joseph Caponeri&rsquo;s closing arguments, he focused on chipping away at the state&rsquo;s</p>
<p>witnesses&rsquo; credibility.</p>
<p>He called Frank, the man who saw Buzz carrying Donna out of the bar that night of the murder,</p>
<p>a quote, wise guy.</p>
<p>And he reiterated that another key witness, Manuel, had a criminal record and wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>telling the truth about Buzz being wasted that night.</p>
<p>Joseph implied that Frank and Manuel were likely getting a sweet deal from police in</p>
<p>exchange for their stories about Buzz.</p>
<p>Once the closing arguments were finished, the judge sent the jury off for deliberation.</p>
<p>He reminded them that should they find Buzz guilty, they could bring a verdict of first-degree</p>
<p>murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter.</p>
<p>According to reporting by the Providence Journal, after 12 hours of deliberation, the jury had</p>
<p>reached a verdict.</p>
<p>With everything from manslaughter to first-degree murder on the table, they found the defendant</p>
<p>not guilty.</p>
<p>Across the board.</p>
<p>Buzz was a free man.</p>
<p>But even though he was found not guilty in the court of law, the community of Pawtucket</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t so quick to acquit.</p>
<p>Most of the locals that are still around from this case are still adamant when you talk</p>
<p>to them today that he was responsible.</p>
<p>By the time Buzz&rsquo;s trial was over in November of 1980, the investigation into Donna&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>I mean, going into the trial, police were confident that they had their guy.</p>
<p>So when the trial was over, they didn&rsquo;t even have any other leads to follow, let alone</p>
<p>any other viable suspects to look into.</p>
<p>So with that, not even a year after her murder, Donna&rsquo;s case went cold.</p>
<p>And it would stay that way for decades.</p>
<p>In 2019, Detective Cormier inherited the case.</p>
<p>And even though Donna&rsquo;s murder was one of the coldest cases Pawtucket had at this point,</p>
<p>she wanted to take a shot at warming it up.</p>
<p>She revisited several witnesses who were interviewed all those decades ago to hear their stories</p>
<p>firsthand.</p>
<p>I have talked to some people that were named back then, including Frank, that still stand</p>
<p>by their story and still are adamant that that was the truth and that they did see him</p>
<p>with her.</p>
<p>They saw him with her in the alley.</p>
<p>Detective Cormier told us that she managed to get the samples from Donna&rsquo;s sexual assault</p>
<p>examination.</p>
<p>Even though the slides were four decades old at that point, she was hopeful that they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>preserve the DNA.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, some parts of the samples were degraded, making it impossible to do</p>
<p>testing.</p>
<p>Detective Cormier says that she&rsquo;s still working on the possibility of sending the slides to</p>
<p>a private lab that has newer technology available.</p>
<p>But like all DNA testing, it comes with a pretty big price tag.</p>
<p>And securing the funds is no quick or easy task.</p>
<p>Donna&rsquo;s died in 2005, and it&rsquo;s possible that the truth of what happened in the early morning</p>
<p>hours of April 22nd, 1979, died with him.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean Detective Cormier is giving up.</p>
<p>She said that despite Donna&rsquo;s case being decades old, the young woman whose life was snuffed</p>
<p>out far too soon hasn&rsquo;t been forgotten by the community.</p>
<p>On my Facebook page, I get a lot of private messages.</p>
<p>So I post things and people will comment, you know, they remembered her, oh, you know,</p>
<p>she babysat me or whatever years ago.</p>
<p>But then I get a lot of private messages from people.</p>
<p>Detective Cormier says she looks into every message about Donna that lands in her inbox.</p>
<p>Because you never know when the person holding the key to the truth will come forward.</p>
<p>Sometimes people sit with these things, and whether they were young at the time, and their</p>
<p>families told them, you know, don&rsquo;t get involved, or, and sometimes people were in fear of the</p>
<p>suspects, so they didn&rsquo;t come forward.</p>
<p>And now, you know, 20, 30 years later, they&rsquo;re not afraid of these people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even live in the same state.</p>
<p>So sometimes people come forward or call my tip line and say to me, listen, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if this helps or not, but this is what I remember from then.</p>
<p>So, you know, I like to hear from everybody.</p>
<p>And I do like to hear from people who knew the victim, because I want to know just as</p>
<p>much about how they lived as I do about how they died.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just as important to me, because you can&rsquo;t figure out who killed them if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what their lifestyle was.</p>
<p>Just recently, Detective Cormier received a message from someone who wanted to be a</p>
<p>confidential informant.</p>
<p>They said that they were just a teenager when Donna was killed, but they had information</p>
<p>that they wanted to share with her.</p>
<p>Detective Cormier wouldn&rsquo;t share with us what the informant said, since the lead is</p>
<p>still being actively investigated.</p>
<p>But she said that the person has provided quite a bit of new information about Buzz.</p>
<p>Information that could prove useful to the investigation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked before why I work on cases where the suspect is dead.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not for the sense of prosecution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I can go and tell a family, put a face to it, that this is who took your loved</p>
<p>one from you.</p>
<p>And sometimes I can&rsquo;t give them the why, because a lot of people want to know why.</p>
<p>Why my sister?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great to be able to provide that, but you can&rsquo;t always.</p>
<p>But if I can at least say who, that would help.</p>
<p>The fact that somebody got away with it and was still walking around while the victim</p>
<p>lost their life.</p>
<p>And the other part of it for me is, if that were my mom, my sister, my child, I would</p>
<p>want to know that somebody was still working on that case and not just letting it go because</p>
<p>new cases come in.</p>
<p>That victim and that family deserve justice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what motivates me.</p>
<p>Donna&rsquo;s life was just beginning when it was snatched away from her more than 40 years</p>
<p>ago.</p>
<p>She still deserves justice, whether her killer is roaming free or not, her family deserves</p>
<p>answers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad to think that someone got away with sexually assaulting and killing her,</p>
<p>let alone just steps away from a crowded bar.</p>
