    <p>When we&rsquo;re beyond good and evil, you know,</p>
<p>and all that&rsquo;s left is the will to power,</p>
<p>then why are we surprised at the powerful rise</p>
<p>and that they use the powerless for their purposes?</p>
<p>When we forget ideas like equality and rights,</p>
<p>which are grounded in God,</p>
<p>why are we surprised that death camps follow?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Bishop Robert Barron,</p>
<p>founder of Word on Fire and one of the greatest educators</p>
<p>in the world on the beauty and wisdom within Catholicism,</p>
<p>Christianity, and religious faith in general.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Bishop Robert Barron.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the big question.</p>
<p>Who is God?</p>
<p>According to Christianity, according to Catholicism,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;s definition.</p>
<p>God is ipsum, essay, subsistence.</p>
<p>God is the subsistent act of to be itself.</p>
<p>Another way to state that in Aquinas</p>
<p>is God is that reality, unique, absolutely unique,</p>
<p>in which essence and existence coincide.</p>
<p>To be God is to be to be.</p>
<p>Those are all ways of talking about what we mean by God.</p>
<p>They are kind of nomic, and that&rsquo;s on purpose.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost a Zen koan kind of quality</p>
<p>about the way we talk about God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying something that&rsquo;s substantive,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more in like a via negativa mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like what God is not,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nothing in the world</p>
<p>that would correspond to those descriptions.</p>
<p>So anything in the world would be a being of some type</p>
<p>or an event of some type,</p>
<p>some particular mode of existence.</p>
<p>And God is not an entity in the world.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s the fundamental mistake</p>
<p>that atheists old and new make all the time,</p>
<p>is they think of God as a big being.</p>
<p>When Aquinas says that God is not in any genus,</p>
<p>even the genus of being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the strangest remarks in the whole tradition,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So you say, well, at the very least,</p>
<p>God must be a being, right?</p>
<p>And Aquinas&rsquo;s answer is no, he&rsquo;s not in the genus of being.</p>
<p>So we talk about God being beyond being and so on.</p>
<p>To say in God essence and existence coincide</p>
<p>is to say God&rsquo;s very nature is to be,</p>
<p>and that can&rsquo;t be true of any contingent thing in the world.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m doing there is I&rsquo;m gesturing</p>
<p>the way the tradition does toward God,</p>
<p>using language that&rsquo;s at the same time</p>
<p>philosophically precise and gnomic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both accurate, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>God, essence and existence coincide.</p>
<p>What God is is the same as God&rsquo;s active to be.</p>
<p>But now what does that mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure,</p>
<p>because nothing in our ordinary experience</p>
<p>corresponds to that.</p>
<p>Everything in our experience is a being of some type.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s existence received according to the mode</p>
<p>of some essence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true of God,</p>
<p>which is why he can&rsquo;t be found in the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, as I say, the fundamental mistake is,</p>
<p>oh, I guess theists are those that believe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this being alongside the other beings</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>And then atheists say, oh no, there is no such being.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a category error.</p>
<p>Dawkins, I think, cites Bertrand Russell.</p>
<p>To the effect that proving the nonexistence of God</p>
<p>is a bit like proving the nonexistence of a China teapot</p>
<p>orbiting between Earth and Mars.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s precisely what God is not,</p>
<p>some entity that&rsquo;s sort of hidden</p>
<p>among the other entities of the universe.</p>
<p>God is the reason why there&rsquo;s a contingent realm at all,</p>
<p>is the way to put it.</p>
<p>In more theological language,</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s the creator of all things.</p>
<p>So if God is outside of our world,</p>
<p>is it possible for us to visualize,</p>
<p>to comprehend, to know God?</p>
<p>Not utterly, of course.</p>
<p>And I would say our knowledge begins always in this world,</p>
<p>begins in ordinary experience.</p>
<p>But I think we can, through metaphysical analysis,</p>
<p>through philosophical reasoning,</p>
<p>can come to some knowledge of a reality</p>
<p>which is transcendent to our experience.</p>
<p>So we gesture toward it.</p>
<p>I always like Aquinas who says the language about God</p>
<p>that we use is analogical.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not univocal, meaning what I say about that can</p>
<p>or about this bottle, I can say about God.</p>
<p>No, that makes God an entity.</p>
<p>At the same time, it&rsquo;s not simply equivocal.</p>
<p>So if I say, well, that thing is and God is,</p>
<p>I mean totally different things.</p>
<p>No, no, I mean something analogous.</p>
<p>So to be God is to be, to be.</p>
<p>So the real meaning of being is the being of God.</p>
<p>The being of that thing or this thing,</p>
<p>or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles</p>
<p>would be analogous to God&rsquo;s manner of being.</p>
<p>So on that basis, I can make some statements.</p>
<p>I can, I can theorize.</p>
<p>And even at the limit, as you suggest, I can visualize.</p>
<p>So we have metaphors for God,</p>
<p>and the Bible is replete with those, right?</p>
<p>So God is a rock.</p>
<p>You know, God&rsquo;s like a lion.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s like this and that.</p>
<p>Or the Bible will sometimes imagine God</p>
<p>as a human being walking around, you know.</p>
<p>Now, only the crudest fundamentalism would say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a univocal, accurate description of God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an image that&rsquo;s catching something</p>
<p>of God&rsquo;s manner of being.</p>
<p>Then what does it mean to believe in God?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a word, and we have to limit ourselves</p>
<p>to human interpretable words today.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word called faith.</p>
<p>What does faith mean?</p>
<p>So if we can&rsquo;t really directly know God,</p>
<p>you kind of sneak up to the idea of God with metaphors.</p>
<p>Better he sneaks up on us.</p>
<p>Because I like the language of grace.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s action comes first.</p>
<p>So if I stay perfectly within the realm of I&rsquo;m seeking</p>
<p>with my kind of eagle eyes and my inquiring mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna find God that way.</p>
<p>I might find a path that opens up.</p>
<p>But I would say finally God finds me,</p>
<p>and I think then the language of faith</p>
<p>begins to make more sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Paul Tillich, though, the Protestant theologian,</p>
<p>said the most misunderstood word</p>
<p>in the religious vocabulary is faith.</p>
<p>Because he said the way we take it usually</p>
<p>is something subrational.</p>
<p>You know, I have proof of this.</p>
<p>I really know this, and I only kind of believe that.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s just a personal opinion or impression.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s to identify faith with the kind of infrarational.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not it.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t want something infrarational.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want superstition or childish credulity.</p>
<p>So authentic faith is the darkness beyond reason</p>
<p>and on the far side of reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super irrational, not infrarational.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very important move.</p>
<p>At the limit of what I can know,</p>
<p>at the limit of my striving and my vision,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this horizon that opens up.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true even in ordinary ways of knowing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of a horizon</p>
<p>that lures us beyond what I&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>Faith has to do more with that kind of darkness</p>
<p>rather than a darkness prior to reason.</p>
<p>The darkness beyond the horizon prior to reason,</p>
<p>first of all, the poetry of your language is incredible.</p>
<p>To be, to be, I have a million questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>I do too on this.</p>
<p>So first of all, let me just jump around.</p>
<p>You mentioned to be, to be a few times.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, to be me is to be a human being, right?</p>
<p>To be this is to be a table,</p>
<p>to be this is to be a microphone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll use Aquinas&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the act of being poured, if you want,</p>
<p>into the receptacle of some essential principle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got an ontological structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an existent, it&rsquo;s a thing that exists,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s existing in a limited way</p>
<p>according to an essential principle.</p>
<p>So God, so what&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>What kind of being is he?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go back to Moses now.</p>
<p>When the Israelites asked me, you know, what&rsquo;s your name?</p>
<p>What should I tell them?</p>
<p>And he says, you know, famously, I am who I am.</p>
<p>But see, Aquinas reads that as a very accurate remark.</p>
<p>So Moses is wondering, okay, there&rsquo;s a lot of gods</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of things, a lot of entities.</p>
<p>Well, which one are you?</p>
<p>You gotta be one of them.</p>
<p>So tell me your name.</p>
<p>In philosophical language, give me the essence</p>
<p>that receives your act of existing, right?</p>
<p>And God&rsquo;s answer blows the mind of Moses</p>
<p>and the whole tradition.</p>
<p>I am who I am.</p>
<p>To be God is to be.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not this or that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not up or down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here or there.</p>
<p>God is that whose center is everywhere</p>
<p>and whose circumference is nowhere, as the mystics put it.</p>
<p>Now, can I get a clear and distinct idea of that?</p>
<p>No, and in a way, that&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>If I could, I&rsquo;d be talking about a being of some kind.</p>
<p>So to be God is to be.</p>
<p>To be is to, and that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>Moses, take off your sandals, you&rsquo;re on holy ground.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna go over confidently</p>
<p>and find out what this thing is, this burning bush.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna find out.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Take off your shoes, you&rsquo;re on holy ground</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not in charge here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not in command.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;ve got shoes on,</p>
<p>you can walk wherever you want.</p>
<p>You can walk with confidence.</p>
<p>But you take your shoes off, you&rsquo;re much more vulnerable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s appropriate when you&rsquo;re talking about God.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s another interesting thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think about the burning bush</p>
<p>in this connection before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a bush that&rsquo;s on fire but not consumed.</p>
<p>Beings are competitive with each other.</p>
<p>And so these can&rsquo;t be in the same place at the same time,</p>
<p>these two beings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mutually exclusive if you want.</p>
<p>But as God comes close to a creature,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t destroy it or consume it.</p>
<p>But the creature becomes more beautiful</p>
<p>and more radiant, right?</p>
<p>And see, compare it to the classical gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>When they come bursting into life and experience,</p>
<p>things are incinerated and people give way</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s this biblical idea of God comes close</p>
<p>and sets things on fire but doesn&rsquo;t burn them up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s not a competitive being</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>If he were a big being, then he&rsquo;d be competing for space,</p>
<p>so to speak, on the same ontological grid.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>So God can come close and we come more fully alive.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re starting to gesture toward the incarnation,</p>
<p>I mean, the central Christian doctrine,</p>
<p>that God can actually become a human</p>
<p>without overwhelming the human he becomes, right?</p>
<p>So I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of the next step.</p>
<p>But the basic idea of God is noncompetitively</p>
<p>transcendent to the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another way to get at it.</p>
<p>Noncompetitively transcendent to the world</p>
<p>so as beyond being as the source of being.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let me make it maybe more imagistic.</p>
<p>I think a really good analogy would be author to book.</p>
<p>Right, so like Tolkien or someone that writes</p>
<p>one of these big sprawling novels.</p>
<p>And Tolkien&rsquo;s good too because he creates a whole world.</p>
<p>He creates a new nature, a new language, new history,</p>
<p>all that, think of the thousands of characters</p>
<p>and the plots and subplots and all of it.</p>
<p>Tolkien is utterly responsible</p>
<p>for every bit of that story, right?</p>
<p>Every character, every plot, every subplot,</p>
<p>every description, he&rsquo;s completely responsible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s involved in every nook and cranny of it.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s not in the story, he&rsquo;s not in the book.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna find him as a character in the book.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the category mistake of the atheist in a way</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m looking for God, he&rsquo;s a character</p>
<p>in this story somewhere.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s the author of the story.</p>
<p>Mysteriously present to every aspect of the story,</p>
<p>but not a character in it.</p>
<p>Right, he is deeply in the story somehow.</p>
<p>Right. He&rsquo;s present,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not, even if he is a character,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not really, the full embodiment is not a character.</p>
<p>And people inside the book</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really know about the author.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, right. Well, see, Augustine says,</p>
<p>God is simultaneously intime or intimo meo</p>
<p>et superior sumo meo.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s closer to me than I am to myself,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s higher than anything I could possibly imagine</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>But see, once you get the insight</p>
<p>that God is the sheer act of to be,</p>
<p>well, of course that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So right now, God is sustaining us in existence.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Aquinas says, God is in all things by essence,</p>
<p>presence, and power, and most intimately so.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s nowhere in this room.</p>
<p>Okay, well, where&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s nowhere in this room.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s totaliter aliter, we say.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s totally other.</p>
<p>Same time.</p>
<p>But once you crack that code, though,</p>
<p>I think you see it of why that would be true.</p>
<p>And see, now I&rsquo;m getting from more philosophical language</p>
<p>to more mystical language,</p>
<p>because all the mystics talk that way</p>
<p>in these high paradoxes about God&rsquo;s availability</p>
<p>and unavailability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought in the Bible, story after story,</p>
<p>God can neither be grasped nor hidden from.</p>
<p>So the first sinful instinct is to grasp at God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got him, I understand him, I can manipulate him.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Story after story is told, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Well, then the other extreme of the sinner,</p>
<p>all right, then I&rsquo;m gonna run from God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna avoid God.</p>
<p>Jonah and the whale, so he has the call from God,</p>
<p>and he said, no, no, I&rsquo;m gonna refuse that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna run as far away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to Tarshish, which meant Timbuktu for them,</p>
<p>at the end of the world.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s got the whale, swallows him up,</p>
<p>and brings him right back where God wants him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a poetic way of saying</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t escape the press of God.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tower of Babel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna build a tower up to God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna grab hold of God.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So, live in the space in between those two things,</p>
<p>which would be the space of friendship with God,</p>
<p>falling in love with God</p>
<p>is neither grasping nor hiding from God.</p>
<p>You mentioned, again, a lot of beautiful poetic things.</p>
<p>You mentioned grace.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You mentioned sin.</p>
<p>You mentioned incarnation.</p>
<p>Is there a philosophical, pragmatic way</p>
<p>to start talking about the pillars of Christianity?</p>
<p>What are the defining things that make Christianity to you,</p>
<p>and broadly speaking, to those that follow the religion?</p>
<p>In a way, what we&rsquo;re doing so far</p>
<p>is a necessary propaedeutic,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about God.</p>
<p>What makes Christianity distinctive, of course,</p>
<p>is the claim of the incarnation.</p>
<p>So, we come up out of Judaism.</p>
<p>We come up out of this great monotheistic tradition.</p>
<p>And the Bible itself and all the great commentaries</p>
<p>within Judaism, I think, would agree</p>
<p>with this basic theistic stuff that I&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>Take Moses Maimonides, for example.</p>
<p>Now, what makes Christianity distinct,</p>
<p>this supremely weird claim that God becomes one of us,</p>
<p>God becomes a creature, but without ceasing to be God</p>
<p>and without overwhelming the integrity</p>
<p>of the creature he becomes.</p>
<p>What we see in the burning bush,</p>
<p>that principle which obtains across the board,</p>
<p>so the closer God comes to me,</p>
<p>the more radiant I become, right?</p>
<p>But take that now to the nth degree,</p>
<p>would be what we mean by the incarnation,</p>
<p>the incarnation of the Son of God becoming a creature</p>
<p>in such a way as to make humanity radiant and beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the pillar of Christianity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the incarnation.</p>
<p>And what follows from that is the redemption</p>
<p>of all of reality, so not just of human beings,</p>
<p>but in becoming a creature, God divinizes the world.</p>
<p>The Greek fathers always said God became human,</p>
<p>that humans might become God.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good way to sum up, I think,</p>
<p>the essence of Christianity.</p>
<p>Why is this such an important thing?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a distinctive thing,</p>
<p>but why is it so important philosophically</p>
<p>to what it means to be a Christian?</p>
<p>What impact did that have on our world,</p>
<p>on human civilization, on human nature,</p>
<p>on our morals of why live, what to live for,</p>
<p>and the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>Why is incarnation so important?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s massively important</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the divinization principle</p>
<p>that God wants to divinize his creation</p>
<p>and sort of in this concentrated point</p>
<p>of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>But then we talk about the mystical body of Jesus,</p>
<p>so that goes right back to Paul.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re grafted onto Christ,</p>
<p>we talk about that as the church,</p>
<p>we become like cells and molecules in an organism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the church, it&rsquo;s not an organization,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a deformation of ecclesiology.</p>
<p>The church is this organism that begins with Jesus</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s drawing all of humanity,</p>
<p>but ultimately all of nature,</p>
<p>all of creation to himself.</p>
<p>When the Son of Man is lifted up,</p>
<p>he will draw all things to himself,</p>
<p>that idea of the gathering in of a scattered creation.</p>
<p>So in that way, it&rsquo;s at the heart of it.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s all kinds of things.</p>
<p>If God becomes human,</p>
<p>that means there&rsquo;s a dignity to humanity,</p>
<p>which goes beyond anything any humanist</p>
<p>of any stripe has ever said, right?</p>
<p>Ancient, medieval, modern, contemporary.</p>
<p>Christianity is the greatest humanism imaginable.</p>
<p>God became one of us in order to divinize us.</p>
<p>The goal of my life is not just to be a good person,</p>
<p>not just to be materially successful,</p>
<p>not just to be a member of society.</p>
<p>The goal of my life is to become</p>
<p>a participant in the divine nature.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think there is a humanism greater than that,</p>
<p>even conceivably.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I think humanism</p>
<p>is profoundly influenced by the incarnation.</p>
<p>And just our notion of God is noncompetitive to us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so important, because I think in so many systems</p>
<p>from mythology onward,</p>
<p>you have these competitive understandings of God.</p>
<p>When Jesus says to his disciples the night before he dies,</p>
<p>I no longer call you servants but friends,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an extraordinary moment.</p>
<p>Because every God who&rsquo;s ever been served,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s the best we can hope for</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ll be as the servant of God.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll try to obey you, Lord.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to do what you want.</p>
<p>But when Jesus says, I no longer call you servants</p>
<p>or slaves, he would have said in the Greek there, you know.</p>
<p>But friends, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine anything greater than that,</p>
<p>becoming God&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a call to become one with God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to become one with God.</p>
<p>Now I should mention,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the greatest religious communicators</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>A huge number of people are fans of yours.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a lot of great conversations.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done Reddit AMAs,</p>
<p>which is a very unique, bold, brave thing.</p>
<p>And on one of them, somebody asked,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most challenging of the seven deadly sins?</p>
<p>So first, what are the seven deadly sins?</p>
<p>What do they have to do with Christianity?</p>
<p>How essential, how crucial they are to the religion?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the most challenging in our modern day?</p>
<p>Yeah, to name them, pride, envy, anger,</p>
<p>sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust</p>
<p>are the seven deadly sins.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re called capital sins sometimes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the head sins from which things tend to flow.</p>
<p>The most fundamental is pride.</p>
<p>Probably most people today, if you talk about like vice,</p>
<p>or you talk about a deadly sin,</p>
<p>they would think about lust.</p>
<p>But the classical authors, including Dante,</p>
<p>who does this pictorially,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the least of the deadly sins is lust,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s most sort of dependent</p>
<p>upon the body and its passions and so on.</p>
<p>The most important is pride.</p>
<p>Pride is the deadliest of deadly sins.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very simple to see why.</p>
<p>Pride is, Augustine calls it incurvatus in se.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m caved in around myself.</p>
<p>Like a black hole, right, to get into the scientific.</p>
<p>But the black hole to me is a great symbol,</p>
<p>you know, that it&rsquo;s so heavy</p>
<p>that it draws everything, including light.</p>
<p>Nothing can escape from it.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s the sinner.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all sinners.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like black holes,</p>
<p>that we draw everything into ourselves.</p>
<p>So as a sinner, and I&rsquo;ll confess I&rsquo;m a sinner,</p>
<p>the temptation is, okay, this is the Bishop Barron moment,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m drawing you now into my world and so on.</p>
<p>What that does is it kills us off,</p>
<p>and it darkens life, and it makes it small,</p>
<p>and heavy, and awful, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, but see, compared to the contrasting thing,</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re lost in a moment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not concerned about the impression I&rsquo;m making.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not concerned about drawing the world into yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not concerned about this monkey on my back</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always telling me, you know,</p>
<p>look good and sound right.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re lost in something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just talking, you know, to a friend,</p>
<p>and the two of you together</p>
<p>are discovering something true or beautiful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lost in a movie, or you&rsquo;re lost in a book.</p>
<p>Those are the best moments in life.</p>
<p>Those are the best,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the least prideful moments, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the light comes out.</p>
<p>I become radiant, because I&rsquo;m overcoming this tendency</p>
<p>to fall in on myself.</p>
<p>Dante is so good, because the way he pictures Satan</p>
<p>in Divine Comedy, and you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s at the center of the Earth.</p>
<p>So like a black hole that way,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s at the center of gravity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at the heaviest place.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not fire where he is, but ice,</p>
<p>which is a much, much better image,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re frozen in place, and you&rsquo;re stuck.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got wings, right?</p>
<p>And they used to be angel wings, because he&rsquo;s an angel,</p>
<p>but now they&rsquo;re like bat wings for Dante,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re flapping.</p>
<p>And all they&rsquo;re doing is making the world around him colder,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s ice, he&rsquo;s stuck in his own iciness,</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s beating his wings over the ice,</p>
<p>making everyone else colder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great image.</p>
<p>And then he has, this is cool too,</p>
<p>he has three faces, Satan,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s the simulacrum of the Trinity.</p>
<p>So every sinner thinks he&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>So I pretend I&rsquo;m God.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got the three faces.</p>
<p>And from all six eyes, he weeps.</p>
<p>Also from all three mouths, he&rsquo;s chewing a sinner.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got Cassius, Brutus, and Judas in the three mouths,</p>
<p>you know, the three traitors.</p>
<p>But I thought, it&rsquo;s just a great image</p>
<p>of all of us sinners, is we&rsquo;re stuck,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s heavy, it&rsquo;s cold,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re chewing on our past resentments,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re weeping in our sadness,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re making the world around us colder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pride.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s an image of pride,</p>
<p>because Satan, that&rsquo;s his great sin, pride,</p>
<p>which is why he needed Michael, right, Mikael,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like God, so that the great challenge to him,</p>
<p>which we need all the time,</p>
<p>is someone to say, wait a minute, wait a minute,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not God.</p>
<p>But the minute we say, I&rsquo;m God,</p>
<p>whew, black hole, I now cave in on myself,</p>
<p>I suck everything into myself,</p>
<p>and I turn into Dante Satan.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great image, that&rsquo;s pride.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most fundamental.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the uber capital sin.</p>
<p>All the other ones flow from that, in a way.</p>
<p>So in general, empathy, humility, compassion,</p>
<p>love thy neighbor, is the way to fight the sin of pride.</p>
<p>Right, which is why the masters tend to say,</p>
<p>this was Bernard, St. Bernard was asked,</p>
<p>what are the three most important virtues?</p>
<p>And he said, humilitas, humilitas, and humilitas,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the opposite of pride.</p>
<p>So, but you know, they&rsquo;re bringing Aquinas in again,</p>
<p>because we think, oh, humility, I&rsquo;m no good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what it means at all.</p>
<p>It means what I was describing before,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just lost in something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just lost in it.</p>
<p>My image, I live out in Santa Barbara,</p>
<p>and I like to walk on the beach out there,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a section of the beach</p>
<p>where they let the dogs run free without leashes.</p>
<p>And when you see a dog, and he&rsquo;s well cared for,</p>
<p>and his master&rsquo;s right there,</p>
<p>and the master&rsquo;s throwing the tennis ball out into the surf,</p>
<p>and the dog goes galloping out into the surf,</p>
<p>and he gets it with a big smile, and comes running back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s humility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an image of heaven,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s just lost in that moment.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care about impressing anybody.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care about what people think of him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just lost in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s heaven, right?</p>
<p>And those moments in our life, when we get that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little hint of paradise.</p>
<p>But the trouble is most of us live, frankly, most of the time</p>
<p>in various levels of hell,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re dealing with these deadly sins.</p>
<p>Like envy flows from pride, because if I&rsquo;m prideful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a black hole, I&rsquo;m in Curvatus In Se, I&rsquo;m collapsed in,</p>
<p>what am I really gonna be concerned about?</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s getting more attention than I am.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s richer than I am.</p>
<p>That lady, she&rsquo;s got a bigger reputation than I do,</p>
<p>and why don&rsquo;t I have that, right?</p>
<p>So envy is a very close daughter of pride.</p>
<p>Anger flows from it.</p>
<p>Why do I get angry?</p>
<p>The dog isn&rsquo;t getting angry on the beach</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s running after the tennis ball.</p>
<p>But I get angry all the time,</p>
<p>I sputter with anger when things aren&rsquo;t going my way,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re insulting me, and you&rsquo;re not doing what I want,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m being hurt, my reputation.</p>
<p>So anger flows from pride, you know?</p>
<p>All of them do, all of the deadly sins do.</p>
<p>So you said, I&rsquo;m a sinner.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all sinners.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you mentioned Satan.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the, so there&rsquo;s heaven and hell,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s God and Satan.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the line between what it means to be good</p>
<p>and not good enough?</p>
<p>Or I hesitate to use the word sort of evil,</p>
<p>but maybe overwhelmingly sinful.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the line between hell and heaven?</p>
<p>Think of them as limit concepts, maybe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like heuristic devices.</p>
<p>So heaven would name this ultimate friendship with God.</p>
<p>So think of the dog on the beach,</p>
<p>who is just, he&rsquo;s fallen in love with his environment,</p>
<p>with his master, with the surf.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just lost in it, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s forgotten himself, he&rsquo;s transcended himself,</p>
<p>and is now lost in the wonder of the beauty of that place.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the limit of that</p>
<p>is the friendship with God that we talked about,</p>
<p>that I become the friend of God.</p>
<p>I become so forgetful of myself,</p>
<p>so lost in the beauty and truth and goodness of God</p>
<p>that I found beatitude, right?</p>
<p>I found joy, the beatific vision, we call it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the limit case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re tending.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where God wants us to go.</p>
<p>Think of hell as the limit case in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s curvatus in se.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the black hole.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all sinners,</p>
<p>meaning we&rsquo;re somewhere on that spectrum.</p>
<p>We have good days and bad days,</p>
<p>and we have good moments and bad moments,</p>
<p>and I can be drawn toward sin.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s purpose on Christianity&rsquo;s reading</p>
<p>is to bring us out of that.</p>
<p>Now, where did he go?</p>
<p>He went all the way into it to get us out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pulling a sock back out.</p>
<p>The sock&rsquo;s inside out, you have to go all the way in</p>
<p>and pull it back out.</p>
<p>And so God had to go all the way down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the trajectory of the incarnation.</p>
<p>Though he was in the form of God,</p>
<p>and this is St. Paul,</p>
<p>Jesus did not deem equality with God</p>
<p>a thing to be grasped at,</p>
<p>but rather emptied himself and took the form of a slave,</p>
<p>being born in the likeness of men.</p>
<p>But then he was known to be of human estate,</p>
<p>and he accepted even death, death on a cross.</p>
<p>And so Paul imagines the incarnation as this downward journey</p>
<p>in order to get all of us, right?</p>
<p>All of us who were stuck, were stuck in our sin.</p>
<p>And so again, Paul says he became sin on the cross.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really, really powerful idea.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t a sinner, because then he&rsquo;d need to be saved too.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a sinner, but he entered into our dysfunction</p>
<p>in order to pull us back out of it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really powerful message, an embodiment,</p>
<p>sort of educating the world about sin.</p>
<p>That said, day to day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s oscillations in terms of how much each human sins,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a struggle against that.</p>
<p>So that dog that loses himself on the beach</p>
<p>may have had a lot of sex with other dogs leading up to that.</p>
<p>That was, may have been not the best dog</p>
<p>he could be leading up to that.</p>
<p>So how, if it&rsquo;s a math equation,</p>
<p>what does the final calculation look like</p>
<p>in terms of ending up in heaven?</p>
<p>What does it mean to live a good life in the end?</p>
<p>Is it the average amount of sin you do is low?</p>
<p>Are you allowed to make mistakes?</p>
<p>Yeah, the metric is love, right?</p>
<p>And love is not a feeling, it&rsquo;s an act of the will.</p>
<p>To will the good of the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Aquinas again.</p>
<p>To will the good of the other as other.</p>
<p>You see, that&rsquo;s the anti black hole principle.</p>
<p>When I, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Will the good of the other.</p>
<p>As other.</p>
<p>See, because if I&rsquo;m willing your good,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for me.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s good for you that I&rsquo;m on this program,</p>
<p>I guess, I&rsquo;m willing your good,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s gonna be down to my benefit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just an indirect egotism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I see love is really rare and strange,</p>
<p>that I really want what&rsquo;s good for you as other.</p>
<p>So not connected to the black hole tendency</p>
<p>of my own prideful ego.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;ve broken that, I&rsquo;ve forgotten self</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve moved into the space of your own good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what love is.</p>
<p>Now, God wants us to be,</p>
<p>by this they will know that you&rsquo;re my disciples,</p>
<p>that you love one another, Jesus says.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, life is ups and downs and back and forth</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re better or worse at that.</p>
<p>The point of a church is to graft us onto Christ</p>
<p>that we might become more and more conformed to love.</p>
<p>But you know, the final calculus, I&rsquo;ll leave that to God.</p>
<p>I mean, but use love as the metric.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when you examine your conscience,</p>
<p>did I will the good of the other today?</p>
<p>How effective was I at that?</p>
<p>And be, just like Ignatius of Loyola, be brutally honest.</p>
<p>Or was I just willing someone&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because it was good for me?</p>
<p>Where were those moments where I was like the dog</p>
<p>on the beach, see?</p>
<p>And then see, play it the way,</p>
<p>not so much God the law giver surveying</p>
<p>and you did three of those and four.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s God wants us to be fully alive.</p>
<p>Saint Irenaeus is one of my great heroes,</p>
<p>ancient, you know, patristic figure.</p>
<p>And his famous line is gloria de homo vivens, right?</p>
<p>The glory of God is a human being fully alive.</p>
<p>See, and that gets us over this sort of obsession</p>
<p>with the illegalism and did I do enough?</p>
<p>And is that, that&rsquo;s a big enough sin.</p>
<p>God wants us fully alive.</p>
<p>The key to that is willing the good of the other.</p>
<p>He died that we might come to a richer</p>
<p>appropriation of that.</p>
<p>So to be fully alive is to be in love with the world</p>
<p>or to love the world deeply.</p>
<p>And what love means is the other.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Get out of yourself, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the humility, yeah, getting out of yourself.</p>
<p>Let go.</p>
<p>That somehow is not, that&rsquo;s not even selfless</p>
<p>because the word selfless requires there to be a self.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like just letting go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I might talk about like a gift of self</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re self aware but you give a gift of yourself.</p>
<p>Your self becomes not a magnet drawing things into itself</p>
<p>but it becomes a radiant source of life for others.</p>
<p>I think Mother Teresa would have had a keen sense</p>
<p>of herself, it seems to me.</p>
<p>But it was to light other people up</p>
<p>so that they might be radiant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the game.</p>
<p>So you could probably articulate it that way too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting thing.</p>
<p>But we have to be hard nosed about it.</p>
<p>Like your friend Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>love is a harsh and dreadful thing, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a feeling.</p>
<p>And our culture is so sentimentalized love</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s having warm feelings or doing what people want.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not it at all.</p>
<p>Love is always correlated to the order of the good.</p>
<p>Because if I&rsquo;m willing the good of the other,</p>
<p>I have to know what that good is, right.</p>
<p>So a parent does this, oh, I&rsquo;ll give the kid</p>
<p>whatever she wants.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not love, that&rsquo;s indulgence</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s sentimentality.</p>
<p>But I have to know what the goods really are</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna will them for you, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, in some sense, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>A component of love is the struggle to know the other.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the struggle to understand.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I mean by empathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, yeah, it&rsquo;s not Valentine&rsquo;s Day romantic gifts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a struggle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trying to understand,</p>
<p>trying to perturb your own mind</p>
<p>and that of another human being</p>
<p>to try to figure out who they are,</p>
<p>what they want, what makes them happy,</p>
<p>what are they afraid of, what are they hoping for.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a dance, a dance of conversation,</p>
<p>a dance of just shared experiences</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And all of that requires for you to be,</p>
<p>I guess, yeah, empathize.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself in their place</p>
<p>and then love that person</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re living inside that person.</p>
<p>Yeah, several minutes ago</p>
<p>about the pillars of Christianity.</p>
<p>So we talked about God, talked about incarnation,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re getting now to a third key one,</p>
<p>namely the Trinity.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re monotheists, right,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t think God is monolithically one.</p>
<p>We think God is a play of persons.</p>
<p>And the Father from all eternity</p>
<p>by a great mental act forms his interior word,</p>
<p>as Aquinas puts it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the logos, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the verbum, that&rsquo;s the word</p>
<p>by which the Father knows himself.</p>
<p>And we call it the Son.</p>
<p>So the imago, it&rsquo;s the image of the Father.</p>
<p>But then see, the great thing is</p>
<p>that imago is not like just a dead image on a mirror</p>
<p>or a dead image at a pond or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a full reflection of the Father&rsquo;s being.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one in being with the Father.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Son has everything the Father has</p>
<p>except being the Father.</p>
<p>But that means that the two of them look at each other</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just crazy in love with each other</p>
<p>because the Father&rsquo;s the fullness of being,</p>
<p>the Son is the fullness of being.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re so crazy in love with each other that they,</p>
<p>this is Fulton Sheen put it this way,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this, ah, they just,</p>
<p>they love each other with this sigh.</p>
<p>And we call that the Spiritus Sanctus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the holy breath, right?</p>
<p>The holy sigh of love between the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one being, one essence we say of God.</p>
<p>But in these three persons,</p>
<p>but all your language about like dance</p>
<p>and play and community,</p>
<p>the Greek Fathers talked about perichoresis,</p>
<p>which means God, the three persons kind of sit</p>
<p>in a choir together.</p>
<p>So they sing together, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, see, Christianity is unique in this claim,</p>
<p>that God is love.</p>
<p>So every religion will say God loves,</p>
<p>you know, in some way.</p>
<p>Love is an attribute of God.</p>
<p>God is, or love is a thing that God does sometimes.</p>
<p>But Christianity is unique in all the religions</p>
<p>in saying that God is love.</p>
<p>And somehow the Holy Trinity embodies that idea.</p>
<p>I mean, that philosophically has always been confusing to me,</p>
<p>what it means to be three things</p>
<p>and at the same time be one God,</p>
<p>the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>What is this dance between these three?</p>
<p>What exact, like how do you visualize,</p>
<p>how do you understand this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This very fascinating, essential thing for Christianity.</p>
<p>The first thing I&rsquo;d say is what we already</p>
<p>have been sort of talking about,</p>
<p>is if you say God is love,</p>
<p>and most people probably say, yeah, I like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea, God is love.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very peculiar because if he is love,</p>
<p>there has to be in his unity a lover, a beloved,</p>
<p>and the love that they share.</p>
<p>Otherwise he isn&rsquo;t loved by his very essence.</p>
<p>He would love, it would be an attribute of God</p>
<p>or an action of God.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s his very nature,</p>
<p>there has to be lover, beloved, and love shared.</p>
<p>And the tradition eventually came to see that.</p>
<p>The image I was using before of the Father,</p>
<p>his imago, the Son, well that&rsquo;s born of God&rsquo;s infinite mind.</p>
<p>So of course God has an image of himself.</p>
<p>Heck, I&rsquo;ve got an image of myself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I can pull off as a puny little creature.</p>
<p>God in his infinity has a perfect imago of himself.</p>
<p>And they have to fall in love with each other.</p>
<p>What else can they do?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re in the presence of infinite good.</p>
<p>And so it has to follow that you then have</p>
<p>the shared love that connects them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we generate, if you want,</p>
<p>this idea of the three persons in God.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the church.</p>
<p>One of the defining characteristics of Catholicism</p>
<p>is the Catholic church.</p>
<p>What is the Catholic church?</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s the mystical body of Jesus.</p>
<p>So as I said before, it&rsquo;s not an organization.</p>
<p>If we do it that way, we&rsquo;re gonna miss it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got organizational elements to it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a bishop, I&rsquo;m a office holder within the church.</p>
<p>But the church is an organism, not an organization.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a organism of interconnected cells, as I said,</p>
<p>namely all of the baptized,</p>
<p>gathered around Christ in a mystical union.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the church.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s buildings, there&rsquo;s titles.</p>
<p>Sure, because it manifests itself institutionally then.</p>
<p>So are the sort of heavy things about that</p>
<p>all have to do with pride?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>The sexiness of the buildings?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, whatever is corrupt in the church,</p>
<p>of course, it comes from pride, from sin.</p>
<p>And one thing I like about the New Testament</p>
<p>is so clear on that.</p>
<p>Paul is, in his little tiny communities,</p>
<p>so before there was a Vatican or dioceses or anything,</p>
<p>Paul had these little tiny communities of Christians</p>
<p>like in Corinth and Ephesus.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the one thing we know about them?</p>
<p>Is they fought with each other.</p>
<p>Because Paul&rsquo;s always uprating them</p>
<p>and telling them, come on, would you people get it together?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s bewitched you?</p>
<p>So from the beginning, we&rsquo;ve been fighting with each other</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re made up of sinners.</p>
<p>So one thing we do in Catholic ecclesiology</p>
<p>is the official name for the study of the church,</p>
<p>is to talk about the treasure in earthen vessels.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s language again.</p>
<p>The treasure is Christ.</p>
<p>The treasure is the love he&rsquo;s bequeathed to the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the treasure that we have.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always held in these really fragile vessels,</p>
<p>namely us, and so it&rsquo;s gonna be marked by corruption</p>
<p>and stupidity and pride and everything else.</p>
<p>Well, nevertheless, there&rsquo;s a hierarchy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s titles and so on.</p>
<p>If we remove pride from the picture,</p>
<p>so the best possible interpretation of the hierarchy</p>
<p>that makes up this one organism, this living organism,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of the pope, for example?</p>
<p>What is the role of a bishop, for example?</p>
<p>What is the role of the hierarchy</p>
<p>in terms of the broader vision of Christianity,</p>
<p>Catholicism as a religion?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a devotee of this guy named Johann Adam M√ºller,</p>
<p>who was a theologian early part of the 19th century,</p>
<p>and he was part of the kind of romantic movement.</p>
<p>And he said the purpose of the pope is to symbolize</p>
<p>and embody and draw together the unity of the entire church.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the personal symbol of the unity of the church.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s a bishop?</p>
<p>The bishop is the personal symbol</p>
<p>of the unity of a diocese.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s a pastor of a parish?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the personal symbol of the unity of that parish.</p>
<p>So he understood it not so much organizationally</p>
<p>as organically, again.</p>
<p>It was like, what, that around which the pattern</p>
<p>organizes itself.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that unifying figure,</p>
<p>the community will kind of reciprocate.</p>
<p>And you see that all the time.</p>
<p>Without headship, we would say.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more symbolic and organic</p>
<p>than it is organizational.</p>
<p>So symbols for community.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s such fascinating peculiarities</p>
<p>to each individual symbol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different characteristics</p>
<p>that make up the different people.</p>
<p>They have different ways of communicating.</p>
<p>They have different hopes and fears</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re all symbols,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of the different peculiarities</p>
<p>of those symbols?</p>
<p>Of being an inspiring uniter versus maybe a stronger type</p>
<p>of more judgmental kind of communicator,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Can you maybe speak to the human part of these symbols?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I might just shift to another image of shepherd.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a classic biblical image.</p>
<p>And as a bishop, I walk around with this thing</p>
<p>called a crozier, which is a shepherd&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the symbol of the bishop&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>And the crozier, though, is a kind of in your face thing</p>
<p>in a way, because it&rsquo;s got the end of it</p>
<p>was meant to hold off wild animals.</p>
<p>And then the crook part of it was meant to bring sheep back</p>
<p>to the fold.</p>
<p>So I walk in with that, oh, this is nice.</p>
<p>Oh, look at the bishop coming in.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a kind of in your face symbol</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m here to defend the church against predators.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also here to draw people in</p>
<p>who are wandering too far away.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of the role of the hierarchy</p>
<p>and the Pope and bishops and pastors.</p>
<p>Pastor just means shepherd, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the shepherd of a parish.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like just all sunshine and light</p>
<p>and what a pretty image.</p>
<p>The one who embodies the unity of the community</p>
<p>is also the shepherd.</p>
<p>Okay, but again, leaning on the human thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The church is an institution.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>but there is an element of power that corrupts.</p>
<p>An absolute power corrupts absolutely,</p>
<p>as the old saying goes.</p>
<p>Let me ask you something else that came up</p>
<p>on the Reddit AMA.</p>
<p>Yeah, megachurches and the prosperity gospel.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve mentioned that you may not be a fan.</p>
<p>What are your views on this?</p>
<p>And what are your views in general of money and power</p>
<p>corrupting the heads of these institutions?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the prosperity gospel</p>
<p>because the gospel is about Jesus journey</p>
<p>into radical self forgetfulness on the cross.</p>
<p>And he never makes a promise of earthly,</p>
<p>of earthly well being.</p>
<p>Can you explain what the prosperity gospel is?</p>
<p>Yeah, the view that if I follow Jesus</p>
<p>and I follow God with great trust</p>
<p>that I will be rewarded with wealth and position</p>
<p>and status in this world.</p>
<p>It might be God&rsquo;s will when I get that.</p>
<p>But you know, Aquinas said this,</p>
<p>say I look at a very sinful person,</p>
<p>I say, kind of, he&rsquo;s got a great house</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s richer than I am and all that.</p>
<p>Aquinas says, yeah, but maybe that&rsquo;s a punishment.</p>
<p>Cause maybe all that is leading him away from God.</p>
<p>And actually that&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s way of punishing him.</p>
<p>And the fact that you don&rsquo;t have wealth in a big house</p>
<p>is actually a great gift to you</p>
<p>because now it frees you for doing God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t read, you know, God&rsquo;s favor in worldly terms.</p>
<p>I would say God&rsquo;s favor is, am I awakened to deeper love?</p>
<p>Then I know that I&rsquo;m finding God&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>Now, God might decide, sure,</p>
<p>I want you to have this and that.</p>
<p>I want to provide this to you.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Then I say, thank you, Lord.</p>
<p>How can I use it as an instrument of love?</p>
<p>All the masters talk about detachment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another reason I don&rsquo;t like the prosperity gospel</p>
<p>is though I&rsquo;m getting attached now</p>
<p>to all these material advantages.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m even seeing them as a sign of God&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>Let go of all that.</p>
<p>You let go of it and use it as a vehicle of love.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re rich, the right question is,</p>
<p>okay, Lord, why did you allow me to become rich?</p>
<p>So that, what can I do?</p>
<p>How can my riches be an expression of love?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m popular, if I&rsquo;m healthy,</p>
<p>okay, why am I popular?</p>
<p>Why am I healthy?</p>
<p>How can I use that for your good?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick, in bed, I&rsquo;m suffering.</p>
<p>Okay, Lord, how can I use that as an expression of love?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d rather measure it that way</p>
<p>than through worldly success.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m against the prosperity gospel.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, don&rsquo;t seek worldly possessions,</p>
<p>but whatever happens to you, good or bad,</p>
<p>seek how that could be used</p>
<p>to increase the amount of love in the world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The image I love for this is the Wheel of Fortune,</p>
<p>which is a device on a lot of the Gothic cathedrals.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this great circle, right, this wheel.</p>
<p>At the top of it is a king.</p>
<p>And then it turns this way,</p>
<p>and the king has lost his crown.</p>
<p>And the bottom is a pauper.</p>
<p>And then over here is a king,</p>
<p>is a guy climbing up to power, right?</p>
<p>And then in the middle is a depiction of Christ.</p>
<p>And the idea is just very simple, but very profound,</p>
<p>that the wheel is life, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes you&rsquo;re up, sometimes you&rsquo;re down.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have power and popularity and prestige.</p>
<p>Other times you&rsquo;re losing it, you&rsquo;re going down.</p>
<p>Other times you got none of it.</p>
<p>Other times you&rsquo;re coming back up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t live on the rim of the wheel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make you crazy.</p>
<p>Every point on the rim of the wheel is a point of anxiety.</p>
<p>Where you should live is the center of the wheel,</p>
<p>where Christ is, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the link now to the eternity of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point of love,</p>
<p>where love can flow through you to the world.</p>
<p>And then you can look at the wheel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a Beatles fan, right?</p>
<p>I think I discovered that.</p>
<p>I love the Beatles.</p>
<p>And the song that always comes to my mind</p>
<p>when I think of that image is John Lennon,</p>
<p>the end of his life.</p>
<p>So a guy that, I mean, rode the wheel of fortune like crazy.</p>
<p>You know, he was at the top of the world in every way.</p>
<p>And then Beatles break up and he kind of loses it.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s at the lost weekend in the 70s</p>
<p>at the very bottom.</p>
<p>When he died, he was just kind of coming back up again.</p>
<p>But the song I always think of is watching the wheels,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round.</p>
<p>I really love to watch them roll</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m no longer riding on the merry go round.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right out of the medieval mystics,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not riding on the wheel.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just watching it go round and round.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point of, the Greeks called it apotheia,</p>
<p>and the Latins called it indifference, you know?</p>
<p>Not like I&rsquo;m blas√©, it just means I&rsquo;m detached</p>
<p>from success, failure, less success, more success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m detached from that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here watching the wheel go round and round</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not riding on it anymore.</p>
<p>The mystics have always made that transition.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a difficult question</p>
<p>about the darker side of human nature,</p>
<p>of human power, of institutions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your view on the long history</p>
<p>and widespread reports of sexual abuse of children</p>
<p>by a Catholic priest?</p>
<p>So this is a difficult topic,</p>
<p>but maybe an important one to shine a light on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s awful, you know, and it&rsquo;s been a problem.</p>
<p>Go back to Peter Damian back in the 11th century</p>
<p>was talking about it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a problem, and whenever really sinful</p>
<p>human beings have been in close proximity to children,</p>
<p>we find this issue.</p>
<p>Has it been around the church?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Has it surfaced in a kind of sickening way</p>
<p>in the last 30 years?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad the church has made important strides,</p>
<p>and it has.</p>
<p>Back in 2002, there was a thing called the Dallas Accords</p>
<p>where the bishops of America</p>
<p>put a lot of these protocols in place</p>
<p>that really have been effective</p>
<p>at ameliorating this problem.</p>
<p>The numbers spiked in the 70s and 80s,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been demonstrated over and over again.</p>
<p>And then they fell dramatically after that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not to excuse anything,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s to say I think progress has been made with it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the impulse to secrecy?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, to protect institutions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always, that&rsquo;s a sinful instinct.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not all together.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, an institution is worth protecting,</p>
<p>but if it reaches the point where you&rsquo;re indifferent</p>
<p>to people&rsquo;s wellbeing, then you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>So institutions role should be transparent and honest</p>
<p>with the sins of its members and of itself.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe you can speak to the fact as a priest, a bishop,</p>
<p>as part of Catholicism, you&rsquo;re not allowed to marry,</p>
<p>not allowed to have sex, you&rsquo;re sworn to celibacy.</p>
<p>What is behind that idea?</p>
<p>What is the sort of, we&rsquo;ve talked about some broad stroke</p>
<p>ideas of love, what&rsquo;s behind the idea of celibacy?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good way to get at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a path of love.</p>
<p>So the church is always in favor of inculcating love.</p>
<p>Marriage is a path of love, but so is celibacy.</p>
<p>Saint Paul talks about someone who is preoccupied</p>
<p>with the things of this world and family</p>
<p>and those who are free from that</p>
<p>are freer for doing the work of God.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of a pragmatic justification for celibacy.</p>
<p>And we still, I think, take that seriously.</p>
<p>I look at my own life.</p>
<p>I mean, celibacy has enabled me to do all kinds of things</p>
<p>and go places and minister in a way that I could not</p>
<p>if I had been married.</p>
<p>So I get it, I get the pragmatic side.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m more interested in the sort of mystical side of it.</p>
<p>Remember Jesus was challenged about the person</p>
<p>who had a whole series of husbands and then they all died.</p>
<p>And so in heaven, which husband will the wife have?</p>
<p>And his answer is, in heaven, people don&rsquo;t marry</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not given in marriage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a higher way of love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a more radical way of love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not tied to a particular,</p>
<p>but I think through God is tied to everybody.</p>
<p>The celibate, and this has been</p>
<p>to the beginning of the church, not as a law,</p>
<p>but there were celibates</p>
<p>from the very beginning of the church,</p>
<p>including Jesus, of course, and Paul.</p>
<p>They sense something, that that way of living</p>
<p>mystically anticipates the way we&rsquo;ll love in heaven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign even now within this world</p>
<p>of how we will all love in heaven.</p>
<p>So in that way, it&rsquo;s a bit like pacifists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad there are pacifists in the church.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve known some very powerful witnesses to pacifism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re pacifists because they witness even now</p>
<p>to how we will be in heaven when every tear is wiped away</p>
<p>and we beat our swords into plowshares</p>
<p>and heaven&rsquo;s a place of radical peace,</p>
<p>that some people even now live it.</p>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;m glad not everyone&rsquo;s a pacifist</p>
<p>because I would hold with the church to just war theory</p>
<p>that sometimes all we can do in this finite world</p>
<p>is to fight manifest wickedness.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And just in the same way there&rsquo;s just sex?</p>
<p>Well, no, right, I&rsquo;m glad there are celibates,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad not everyone&rsquo;s a celibate.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>I mean, because married love is a marvelous expression</p>
<p>of the divine love.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good there are some.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always been a small number.</p>
<p>The actual experience of it, would you,</p>
<p>the spiritual nature of it, is it similar to fasting?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been enjoying fasting recently, so not eating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For several days, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that somehow brings you even deeper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in general in love with everything,</p>
<p>with nature and everything.</p>
<p>I see the beauty in the world.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a greater intensity to that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fasting, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, I might use the language of sublimation</p>
<p>or redirection of energy and all that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain sublimation of energies into prayer,</p>
<p>into mysticism, into ministry, a redirection of energies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s meant to be life enhancing.</p>
<p>The same way fasting is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meant ultimately to be life enhancing</p>
<p>and make you healthier and happier.</p>
<p>So celibacy is a path of love.</p>
<p>And I think it does involve a certain redirection</p>
<p>of energies, I&rsquo;d say that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think, do you think it&rsquo;s a heavy burden</p>
<p>for some humans to bear?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>For some priests to bear?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, given the sexual abuse scandal,</p>
<p>is that the thing that breaks humans?</p>
<p>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t tie that to celibacy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been demonstrated over and over again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a priest named Andrew Greeley</p>
<p>who was a priest from my home diocese of Chicago.</p>
<p>And Andy did a lot of research,</p>
<p>he was a sociologist of religion,</p>
<p>did a lot of research into that very question.</p>
<p>And there really is not a correlation</p>
<p>between celibacy per se and the sexual abuse</p>
<p>of children or of anybody.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t make that correlation.</p>
<p>So bad people, sinful people are going to do</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>I think people who have a tendency toward</p>
<p>abusing children sexually are drawn to situations</p>
<p>where they get ready access to kids</p>
<p>and they get institutional cover.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only thing that can go through the list</p>
<p>from sports and Boy Scouts, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been proven again and again.</p>
<p>So I would tie it more to that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t tie it to celibacy.</p>
<p>So the challenge of course is all kinds of,</p>
<p>you said institutional cover,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of institutions that cover</p>
<p>for people that do evil onto the world,</p>
<p>that do sinful things onto the world.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the church</p>
<p>which is, as an organism, is supposed to be an embodiment</p>
<p>of good in this world, of love in this world.</p>
<p>And it breaks people&rsquo;s hearts to see this kind of,</p>
<p>even a small amount, this kind of thing happen</p>
<p>within the church.</p>
<p>It wakes you up to the cruelty, the absurdity</p>
<p>of the world sometimes.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s back to the question of why do bad things</p>
<p>happen to good people?</p>
<p>Why does God allow this kind of thing to happen?</p>
<p>And sort of maybe an unanswerable question.</p>
<p>Do you have an answer to that question?</p>
<p>I can gesture toward it using rather abstract language,</p>
<p>which is true enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely emotionally unsatisfying,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s naming it truthfully enough.</p>
<p>And it goes back to Augustine,</p>
<p>which is God permits evil to bring about a greater good.</p>
<p>Now again, I know how unsatisfying</p>
<p>that sort of spare, austere language can sound,</p>
<p>but it gets us off the horns of a dilemma.</p>
<p>Aquinas, when he lays out a question,</p>
<p>he always has the objections first.</p>
<p>So is there a God?</p>
<p>Well, objection one, objection two, objection three.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s really, you talk about steel manning</p>
<p>and argument, Aquinas is great at that.</p>
<p>One of the really steel manned arguments,</p>
<p>is that the right grammatical form?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the past participle of the steel man?</p>
<p>But one of the best arguments, he formulates it this way.</p>
<p>If one of two contraries be infinite,</p>
<p>the other would be altogether destroyed.</p>
<p>And as an example from his medieval physics,</p>
<p>he goes, if there were an infinite heat,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be no cold, right?</p>
<p>But God is described as infinitely good.</p>
<p>Therefore, if God exists, there should be no evil.</p>
<p>But there is evil.</p>
<p>Therefore, God does not exist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a darn good argument.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really persuasive argument.</p>
<p>And I think, I&rsquo;ve done this for a long time</p>
<p>in apologetics and in sort of higher philosophy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best argument against God.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s something, before I press head with it,</p>
<p>something I find really interesting.</p>
<p>I think the three best arguments against God</p>
<p>all come from within the religious tradition.</p>
<p>Namely, the book of Job.</p>
<p>So Job, he&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a great guy.</p>
<p>He does everything right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s great servant,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s punished in every possible way.</p>
<p>He has every possible suffering.</p>
<p>Aquinas&rsquo;s argument from the Summa,</p>
<p>from the Summa, and then to your friend and mine, Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>I think in the Brothers Karamazov, Ivan&rsquo;s argument,</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s trying to wreck the faith of Alyosha.</p>
<p>And these examples drawn, they think, from Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>from the headlines of his own time,</p>
<p>of the most abject cruelty to children,</p>
<p>like an innocent child being made to suffer.</p>
<p>How in God&rsquo;s name could that happen</p>
<p>if God exists and he&rsquo;s all good?</p>
<p>So I get it, but see, the book of Job,</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas, Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>these are all profoundly believing people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I hear Stephen Fry,</p>
<p>the famously atheist writer,</p>
<p>he will bring out this argument with great authority.</p>
<p>He does, of children with bone cancer</p>
<p>and worms that go into the eyes of children</p>
<p>and blind them before they kill them.</p>
<p>And, but he&rsquo;s been preceded by the author of Job,</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas and Dostoevsky, who stood right,</p>
<p>think of Job, in the whirlwind.</p>
<p>He stands there in the whirlwind, you know?</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t blame the Christian tradition</p>
<p>for not dealing with this problem,</p>
<p>for brushing it under the carpet.</p>
<p>I mean, it has stood in the whirlwind of this problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a difficult problem to deal with,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s all this cruelty of the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of example through history,</p>
<p>just in my own family history with the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>with Stalin, the atrocities that Stalin has brought onto</p>
<p>the people of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>throughout the 20th century is nearly immeasurable.</p>
<p>And yet, when you look at the entirety of human history,</p>
<p>you will see progress, not just the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>but the entirety of the civilization</p>
<p>throughout the 20th century,</p>
<p>and Stalin has a role to play.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dark aspect to,</p>
<p>somehow evil helps us make progress.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to put that in the calculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t, you know, on the local scale,</p>
<p>I want to alleviate suffering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably lean, heavily lean pacifist.</p>
<p>Not out of weakness, but out of strength,</p>
<p>but man, it does seem that history is sprinkled with evil,</p>
<p>and that evil does somehow nudge us towards good.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes we can see it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where the idea comes from,</p>
<p>that evil&rsquo;s permitted to bring about some greater good,</p>
<p>and we can sometimes really see it.</p>
<p>Can we always see it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>In fact, typically we don&rsquo;t see it,</p>
<p>but now you bring another factor into this,</p>
<p>which is the difference between our minds and God&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>So our minds, I mean, look, even,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re remarkably capacious,</p>
<p>but they take in a tiny, tiny, tiny swath of space and time,</p>
<p>and even our eyes kind of take in</p>
<p>so much of the light spectrum,</p>
<p>and these little ape sensorium that we have</p>
<p>that could just take in a little tiny bit of reality, really.</p>
<p>How are we ever in a position to say,</p>
<p>oh no, there&rsquo;s no possible good</p>
<p>that would ever come from that?</p>
<p>Even the greatest evil that Dostoevsky can conjure up,</p>
<p>and Stephen Fry, still, how could we have the arrogance</p>
<p>to say, I know there&rsquo;s no good</p>
<p>that could ever come from that.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s no morally justifiable reason</p>
<p>why God would ever permit that,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s hubris to the nth degree</p>
<p>for us to say that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the assumption behind this claim</p>
<p>that God can permit evil to bring about a greater good.</p>
<p>Now, God understands it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re like little kids, like a four year old,</p>
<p>and their parents make a decision,</p>
<p>and we say, what in the, why in the world</p>
<p>would you do this to me?</p>
<p>This is my pastoral experience.</p>
<p>Years ago, there was a young father,</p>
<p>and his son was like three or something,</p>
<p>and he was in the hospital for something,</p>
<p>I forgot what it was,</p>
<p>but he had to undergo surgery, right?</p>
<p>So after the surgery, he&rsquo;s in great pain,</p>
<p>this poor kid, this three year old kid,</p>
<p>and the dad was there with him, holding his hand,</p>
<p>and the son, this is what the father told me,</p>
<p>he said, he&rsquo;s looking at me like, what gives here?</p>
<p>I mean, why would you, you love me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always assumed that,</p>
<p>and yet you&rsquo;re presiding over this somehow,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re approving of this,</p>
<p>and doing nothing to get me out of it, right?</p>
<p>And he said, the kid couldn&rsquo;t articulate that,</p>
<p>but his eyes did, and the father said,</p>
<p>it was just killing me,</p>
<p>because I knew I couldn&rsquo;t explain it to him.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true, I mean, he could vaguely gesture toward,</p>
<p>but the kid didn&rsquo;t understand surgery,</p>
<p>and cutting his body, and taking things out of it,</p>
<p>and that this was gonna make him much better</p>
<p>in the long run, but I remember thinking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great metaphor for us vis a vis God,</p>
<p>is here&rsquo;s God, infinitely loving God,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s with us all the time, and we say,</p>
<p>what are you doing?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you taking this away from me?</p>
<p>And the answer, I mean, ultimately is trust,</p>
<p>trust me, trust me, surrender to me.</p>
<p>And when we don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we get in trouble with the old pride,</p>
<p>and the hubris, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, but trust me when I tell you,</p>
<p>I mean, I completely get it in my own life,</p>
<p>and as a priest, you&rsquo;re dealing with suffering all the time,</p>
<p>with people in pain all the time.</p>
<p>I remember as a young priest,</p>
<p>there was a policeman in our parish,</p>
<p>so he had a gun, and inexplicably,</p>
<p>no one had any clue.</p>
<p>He got up one night, shot his son to death,</p>
<p>and then shot himself.</p>
<p>This is my parish.</p>
<p>So I went to the wake, I remember, I show up,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m this young, 27 year old goofball priest,</p>
<p>and I roll my collar around, and I walk in,</p>
<p>and there were two coffins,</p>
<p>the two coffins in the room,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the son and the father.</p>
<p>And the mother was there, and she went like this to me.</p>
<p>She saw me, okay, you&rsquo;re the religious guy here, what?</p>
<p>And just by instinct, I went like that too.</p>
<p>I went like, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an answer for you.</p>
<p>But I was there,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying to pat myself on the back,</p>
<p>this is, that&rsquo;s where the church goes,</p>
<p>because Jesus went there.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gesturing toward a more theological response.</p>
<p>The first one&rsquo;s more austerely philosophical,</p>
<p>God permits evil to bring about a good.</p>
<p>But the theological response is, that&rsquo;s where Christ went,</p>
<p>is he went all the way down.</p>
<p>He went all the way down into our suffering.</p>
<p>And see the cross as the limit case of evil,</p>
<p>humiliation and cruelty and institutional injustice</p>
<p>and psychological suffering and spiritual suffering</p>
<p>and death, it&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the Son of God went.</p>
<p>And I would say that&rsquo;s why, as a priest, I went there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my job, is to go to those places.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the ultimate answer to the problem.</p>
<p>So there is, we can&rsquo;t comprehend it,</p>
<p>but there is meaning to the suffering and the injustice.</p>
<p>We trust it because we know on other grounds</p>
<p>of God&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>See, I would resist the claim that,</p>
<p>well, this is such a knockdown argument,</p>
<p>so now we know there is no God.</p>
<p>I would say, no, there are all kinds</p>
<p>of other rational warrants for God.</p>
<p>And so I know that God exists.</p>
<p>I know that God is infinite love,</p>
<p>and now I gotta square that with this experience.</p>
<p>And the way I do that is by a trusting confidence</p>
<p>that God knows what he&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>Again, I know how inadequate that always seems</p>
<p>to anyone who&rsquo;s suffering, including myself,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m in great suffering.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s the best that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>in the great tradition.</p>
<p>So if you were to steel man the case against God</p>
<p>or the existence of God, you find the most convincing</p>
<p>argument is there&rsquo;s evil in the world,</p>
<p>therefore there&rsquo;s no God.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much of it.</p>
<p>If I were to steel man that argument,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d do what Stephen Fry does.</p>
<p>I would do what Dostoevsky&rsquo;s Ivan does.</p>
<p>I would do exactly that.</p>
<p>I would say there&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>And then if you wanna keep pressing it, animal suffering.</p>
<p>So we talk about human suffering,</p>
<p>but the suffering of animals over the eons and so on,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there just too much suffering</p>
<p>to be reconciled with an infinitely good God?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, again, Thomas Aquinas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just used his very steel man argument.</p>
<p>You mentioned that, again, on Reddit,</p>
<p>somebody asked who your favorite communicator</p>
<p>of atheist ideas was, and you mentioned Christopher Hitchens.</p>
<p>Are there other ideas for atheism</p>
<p>that you find particularly challenging?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the one, is the problem of evil.</p>
<p>The other objection in Aquinas,</p>
<p>which has a lot of contemporary resonance,</p>
<p>is can&rsquo;t we just explain everything through natural causes?</p>
<p>Why would you have to invoke a cause</p>
<p>beyond the causes in the world?</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;m trying to explain, let&rsquo;s say for Aquinas,</p>
<p>motion, causality, finality,</p>
<p>can I just do that with natural causes?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that suffice to explain it?</p>
<p>So I get like when naturalists are speaking</p>
<p>or people that are pure materialists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just say, no, that&rsquo;s perfectly adequate.</p>
<p>A scientific account of reality is utterly adequate</p>
<p>to our experience.</p>
<p>So I would steel man that and say,</p>
<p>well, show me why we need something more.</p>
<p>And to do that, you gotta get out of Plato&rsquo;s cave,</p>
<p>it seems to me.</p>
<p>Because my objection to naturalism</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s staying within the realm</p>
<p>of the immediately empirically observable</p>
<p>and making the mistake of saying</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all there is to being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is that needs to be explained.</p>
<p>And long before we get to religion,</p>
<p>just stay with Plato.</p>
<p>The first step out of the cave,</p>
<p>if you combine it now with the parable of the line,</p>
<p>is mathematical objects.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m with those, the many people that would say,</p>
<p>mathematics is an experience of the immaterial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stepped out of a merely empirical,</p>
<p>physical, naturalistic world.</p>
<p>The minute I understand a pure number</p>
<p>or a pure equation or a pure mathematical relationship,</p>
<p>which would obtain in any possible world,</p>
<p>which are not tied to space and time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a first step out of the cave.</p>
<p>And then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections.</p>
<p>For example, in the nature of being.</p>
<p>I mean, so I could talk about this thing</p>
<p>as a physical object and I can analyze it</p>
<p>at all kinds of levels and follow all the scientists</p>
<p>up and down through this thing, and fine, fine.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m still in Plato&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still looking at the flickering images on the wall.</p>
<p>But when I step out of that into the mathematical realm,</p>
<p>I have entered a different realm of being, seems to me.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible for the cave to expand</p>
<p>so large that it encompasses the whole world?</p>
<p>Meaning, is it possible that we&rsquo;re just clueless right now</p>
<p>in terms of, scientifically speaking,</p>
<p>with most of the world we haven&rsquo;t figured out yet?</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s possible through science to know God,</p>
<p>to look outside the world?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fundamentally the limit</p>
<p>of the empirical scientific method,</p>
<p>is that we can&rsquo;t know some of these very big questions.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a scientist,</p>
<p>and I was never all that good at science.</p>
<p>I was more of a humanities guy.</p>
<p>But I love and respect the sciences, but I hate scientism.</p>
<p>And scientism is rampant today, with especially young people.</p>
<p>The reduction of all knowledge</p>
<p>to the scientific form of knowledge.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a vehement opponent of that.</p>
<p>There are dimensions of being that are not capturable</p>
<p>through a scientific method of mere observation,</p>
<p>hypothesis formation, experimentation, et cetera.</p>
<p>As great as that is, as wonderful as that is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still, I think, within Plato&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just at a relatively low level of reality.</p>
<p>You step out of Plato&rsquo;s cave</p>
<p>when you go into pure mathematics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, you know that article,</p>
<p>I just came across it recently,</p>
<p>and discovered this whole literature around it,</p>
<p>is Eugene Wigner&rsquo;s article, 1960,</p>
<p>called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics</p>
<p>to the physical sciences.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the title of it.</p>
<p>Or effectiveness or something like that, yeah.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s so cool is that he&rsquo;s not a religious man.</p>
<p>He was kind of a secular Jew.</p>
<p>But yet he uses the word miracle</p>
<p>like eight times in that article.</p>
<p>Because he just is so impressed by the fact</p>
<p>that high, complex mathematics describes so accurately</p>
<p>the physical world and can be used to create things</p>
<p>and to manipulate.</p>
<p>And why should that be true?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s something very weirdly mysterious</p>
<p>about that relationship.</p>
<p>And I would say it&rsquo;s because you stepped</p>
<p>into a higher order of being,</p>
<p>which is inclusive of a lower level being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Platonic approach,</p>
<p>is that as you move, now I&rsquo;m going to a different metaphor,</p>
<p>you move to higher levels,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re inclusive of the lower levels.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some magic there</p>
<p>that seems to, at least in our current understanding</p>
<p>of science, to be not quite capturable.</p>
<p>Even consciousness, the idea of consciousness.</p>
<p>Can I ask you, where do you think</p>
<p>the laws of nature come from?</p>
<p>So, I mean, sort of the Vigner question,</p>
<p>where does the deep mathematical structure</p>
<p>of things come from?</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>The mathematical structure or the fact</p>
<p>that the structure is somehow pleasing and beautiful.</p>
<p>Because those are two different.</p>
<p>Well, do the first one first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious to tell you,</p>
<p>where do you think it comes from?</p>
<p>I tend to believe, even in terms of physics,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so, so, so much more to be discovered.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re walking around in the dark</p>
<p>trying to figure out a little puzzles here and there,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re patting ourselves on the back</p>
<p>and how many puzzles we&rsquo;ve discovered so far.</p>
<p>Even Gadot&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem,</p>
<p>what are the limits of mathematics,</p>
<p>axiomatic systems?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is the purpose of mathematics,</p>
<p>what is the power of mathematics?</p>
<p>Is it just a useful tool to study the world around us,</p>
<p>or is it something deeper that we&rsquo;re just discovering?</p>
<p>All I know from my emotional perspective,</p>
<p>now I am an engineer, I&rsquo;m a robotics AI person,</p>
<p>from an emotional perspective,</p>
<p>I just find the whole thing beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s really cool to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting clue.</p>
<p>See, one of the arguments for God</p>
<p>is based on the intelligibility of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Wigner, it&rsquo;s a very peculiar fact,</p>
<p>it seems to me, that the world is so radically intelligible.</p>
<p>Why should that be true?</p>
<p>Why should it be the case</p>
<p>that being has this intelligible structure to it?</p>
<p>So it corresponds to an inquiring mind.</p>
<p>So Aquinas can say that the intelligible in act</p>
<p>is the intellect in act.</p>
<p>Meaning there&rsquo;s some deep correspondence</p>
<p>between this and that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m with Wigner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, really weird</p>
<p>and unreasonable and strange.</p>
<p>Now, my answer is, because the creator of the universe</p>
<p>is a great mind and has stamped the world</p>
<p>with intelligibility.</p>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, right?</p>
<p>And the Word was with God,</p>
<p>and all things came to be through the Word.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t picture that so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gesturing in this very powerful direction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intelligence that has imbued the world</p>
<p>with intelligibility.</p>
<p>And we discover that, you know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the simplicity</p>
<p>of the way the world works,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the beauty comes from.</p>
<p>And yes, there&rsquo;s something profound to the mechanism,</p>
<p>whatever that is, God, that brought that to be.</p>
<p>That thought it into being.</p>
<p>That the world has been,</p>
<p>and the Bible says that God said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let there be light,&rsquo; and there was light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God said, well, again, we don&rsquo;t literalize the poetry,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very rich that God spoke the world into being.</p>
<p>So that means it&rsquo;s been imbued with intelligibility</p>
<p>from the beginning.</p>
<p>They say that the condition for the possibility</p>
<p>of the Western physical sciences</p>
<p>was a basically Christian idea,</p>
<p>namely that the world is not God.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can analyze it, experiment upon it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t divinize it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a mystical relation to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not God.</p>
<p>But secondly, that it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>in every nook and cranny intelligible.</p>
<p>And those two ideas are correlated to the idea of creation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been created, it&rsquo;s not God, it&rsquo;s other than God,</p>
<p>but yet it&rsquo;s touched in every dimension by God&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>And when those two things are in place,</p>
<p>the sciences get underway.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t worship the world anymore,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also utterly confident I can come to know it.</p>
<p>And those are theological ideas.</p>
<p>Well, we live in this world,</p>
<p>so we can solve quite a lot of problems of this world</p>
<p>by making the assumption</p>
<p>that this world is fully understandable.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t need to worry about what&rsquo;s outside the world</p>
<p>in some sense in order to build bridges and rockets</p>
<p>and computers and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when we get to the questions that are deeper</p>
<p>about why we&rsquo;re here at all,</p>
<p>what does it mean to be good,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things</p>
<p>do we need to reach outside of this world?</p>
<p>Can I introduce another one?</p>
<p>So I talked about mathematics.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s stepping out of the cave,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stepping out of just the purely empirical world.</p>
<p>But the very fact that we use a word like universe</p>
<p>to me is very interesting.</p>
<p>Even if you say multiple universes,</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s like, well, whatever the whole is, the totality.</p>
<p>Universum, turn toward the one.</p>
<p>Why would we call it that?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t we just call it an aggregate?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just an aggregate of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an aggregate of all kinds.</p>
<p>But we call it a universe.</p>
<p>And my answer from the classical metaphysical tradition</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s the intuition of being.</p>
<p>So I immediately experience things here,</p>
<p>the color and shape, and I can measure them.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;ve really stepped out of the cave</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve now engaged beyond mathematics even,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now into metaphysical reflection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested not just in this thing as an object</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s colored and shaped</p>
<p>and what its atoms and quarks and all that are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m interested now in,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say this thing is real.</p>
<p>So what makes this a being?</p>
<p>And then what are the characteristics of being?</p>
<p>So now from Aristotle to Heidegger,</p>
<p>this question of the nature of being.</p>
<p>But see, I would say we call it a universe</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s turned toward the one of being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this intuition that whatever,</p>
<p>from quarks to galaxies to whatever,</p>
<p>give me a billion other universes,</p>
<p>it would still be existence, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s turned toward the one.</p>
<p>That being unites our experience.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;m at the metaphysical level of analysis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken another step out of the cave.</p>
<p>In Plato&rsquo;s language, I&rsquo;m at the formal level now,</p>
<p>beyond mathematics, the level of forms.</p>
<p>And the formal is inclusive of the mathematical,</p>
<p>which is inclusive of the physical.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s Eugene Wigner,</p>
<p>is that the mathematical includes the physical.</p>
<p>It is metaphysically prior to it.</p>
<p>But here we are sitting in the physical</p>
<p>trying to make sense of why</p>
<p>the unreasonable effectiveness</p>
<p>is the thing that&rsquo;s beyond, which is the mathematics.</p>
<p>My answer is God.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know a better answer.</p>
<p>And as I read Wigner, he wasn&rsquo;t ready to say that.</p>
<p>But I think the language is gesturing.</p>
<p>I was reading someone recently,</p>
<p>some very well known physicist,</p>
<p>who said his answer to Wigner&rsquo;s question</p>
<p>is that whoever is responsible for the universe</p>
<p>must be a mathematician.</p>
<p>And I thought, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>We had a great conversation with him.</p>
<p>He has a complicated and nuanced view of faith,</p>
<p>or faith period.</p>
<p>He has said that he believes in Jesus,</p>
<p>the person and the myth,</p>
<p>and some of the full richness and complexity</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s surprised by his faith.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not sure what to make of it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s almost like meta struggling</p>
<p>with what the heck his faith means.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a super powerful intellect</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t compute the faith that he&rsquo;s experiencing.</p>
<p>So what are some interesting differences</p>
<p>between the two of you, or some commonalities</p>
<p>in terms of your understanding of faith?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very interesting guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a couple of conversations with him.</p>
<p>And I do think he&rsquo;s moving in the direction of faith.</p>
<p>And his lectures on the Bible are very fine, I think.</p>
<p>He reminds me of the church fathers,</p>
<p>because the church fathers would have looked at the,</p>
<p>they call it the moral sense of the scripture.</p>
<p>Peterson probably called it the psychological meaning.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s doing a lot of that.</p>
<p>He, as I read him and talk to him,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s kind of at a Kantian level in regard to Jesus.</p>
<p>What I mean there is, for Kant, Jesus is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so much the historical Jesus,</p>
<p>this figure from long ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Jesus as an archetype of the moral life.</p>
<p>You know, he says he&rsquo;s the image of the person</p>
<p>perfectly pleasing to God.</p>
<p>And so Jesus inhabits our kind of moral imagination</p>
<p>as a heuristic, as a goal that we&rsquo;re tending toward.</p>
<p>But the historical person of Jesus for Kant is like,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s not fuss about that so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this figure.</p>
<p>And as I read Peterson, especially, and talk to him,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s kind of there with the archetype of Jesus.</p>
<p>And even language of like, live as though God exists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the als ob of Kant.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of as if attitude.</p>
<p>And where I repress him when we talk</p>
<p>is in the direction of, no, that&rsquo;s not Christianity yet.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s enlightenment moral philosophy.</p>
<p>But Christianity is very interested</p>
<p>in this historical figure,</p>
<p>and very interested that God really became one of us.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not just an archetype of the moral life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s someone, he&rsquo;s a person who&rsquo;s invaded our world</p>
<p>and gone all the way to the bottom of sin</p>
<p>and thereby saved us, you know.</p>
<p>So the facticity of Jesus ended up the resurrection.</p>
<p>So like, Peterson will talk about the resurrection</p>
<p>as a myth and all that.</p>
<p>And you can find that in different cultures, et cetera.</p>
<p>But Christianity is saying something else.</p>
<p>So in Christianity, when we&rsquo;re talking about who is Jesus,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just an archetype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a myth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a historical figure.</p>
<p>And the very grounded fact that God became one of us</p>
<p>is fundamental to this idea of what Christianity is,</p>
<p>what it means to be a Christian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sin and the love that came here down to earth.</p>
<p>It means we can be one with God.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an archetype.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, it always strikes me,</p>
<p>the difference between, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>mythic expressions and the New Testament.</p>
<p>Read someone like Carl Jung and then Joseph Campbell,</p>
<p>whom he influenced, and then now Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very Jungian.</p>
<p>And this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures.</p>
<p>And great.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot going on there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of calmness, though, about it.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in this culture and that culture,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the form of the moral life,</p>
<p>and mm hmm, I understand all that.</p>
<p>Then you read the New Testament.</p>
<p>Whatever those people are talking about, it&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>They are grabbing you by the shoulders</p>
<p>and shaking you to get your attention,</p>
<p>to tell you about something that happened to them, right?</p>
<p>Like the resurrection, you know,</p>
<p>the myth of the dying and rising God</p>
<p>and how powerful it is in shaping our consciousness.</p>
<p>Mm hmm, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the New Testament.</p>
<p>The New Testament is, did you hear?</p>
<p>Did you, Jesus of Nazareth, whom they put to death,</p>
<p>God raised him from the dead,</p>
<p>and he was seen by 500, and he was seen by Peter.</p>
<p>And then lastly, I saw him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Paul talks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the detached, you know,</p>
<p>psychologist musing on archetypal things.</p>
<p>And I think that makes a huge difference</p>
<p>when it comes to Christianity.</p>
<p>The intensity of the historical details are essential here.</p>
<p>So if you look at Hitler and Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not enough to say, well, power corrupts,</p>
<p>and sometimes, so looking at the archetype of Hitler,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much, much more important,</p>
<p>much more powerful to look at the details</p>
<p>of how he came to power,</p>
<p>what are the ways he did evil onto the world,</p>
<p>and then you can get really intense</p>
<p>about your struggle with some of the complexities</p>
<p>of human nature and power on institutions</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So the historical nature of the Bible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re an historical religion.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been, it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>We generate philosophical reflection.</p>
<p>We can find common ground with archetypal thinking</p>
<p>and all that, we can.</p>
<p>And the church fathers used Greek philosophy,</p>
<p>and Aquinas uses Aristotle, and all that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re an historical religion,</p>
<p>and that matters immensely.</p>
<p>Is the Bible the literal word of God?</p>
<p>How do you make sense of the words that make up the Bible?</p>
<p>I think the best way to get at the Bible</p>
<p>is to think of it as a library, not a book.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a collection of books, right,</p>
<p>from a wide variety of periods, different authors,</p>
<p>different audiences, and different genre.</p>
<p>So in the Bible, you find poetry, you find song,</p>
<p>you find something like history, not in our sense,</p>
<p>but something like history.</p>
<p>You find gospel, which is its own genre.</p>
<p>You find epistolary literature like Paul.</p>
<p>You find apocalyptic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this in the Bible.</p>
<p>So is the Bible literally the word of God?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, is the library literally true?</p>
<p>It depends on what section you&rsquo;re in, right?</p>
<p>So parts of like one and two Samuel, one and two Kings,</p>
<p>number of places in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Are there elements of the historical in there?</p>
<p>Sure, but it&rsquo;s theologically interpreted history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like our sense of history of, you know,</p>
<p>give me 10,000 footnotes and I&rsquo;m gonna look</p>
<p>at all the source material I can possibly find.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like ancient history, like Herodotus,</p>
<p>people like that.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s poetry and there&rsquo;s myth</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s legend and there&rsquo;s song</p>
<p>and all that stuff in the Bible.</p>
<p>So God breathes through all of it, I would say.</p>
<p>He inspired all of it, right, inspirare.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s breathing through all of it.</p>
<p>God is speaking through all of it.</p>
<p>But he speaks in different voices.</p>
<p>He uses different human instruments</p>
<p>and he uses different genre and different types of language.</p>
<p>So we have to be sensitive to that</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re interpreting the Bible.</p>
<p>So the different instruments are more or less,</p>
<p>some are more perfect than others in terms of music?</p>
<p>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say more perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re just different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a symphony and God&rsquo;s like a conductor</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of different instruments</p>
<p>in the orchestra and he loves to breathe through the Psalms.</p>
<p>I prayed the Psalms this morning, I do every day.</p>
<p>In my office, you know, those are songs.</p>
<p>They probably were literally sung, most of them,</p>
<p>at one point.</p>
<p>He breathes through apocalyptic.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re reading the book of Revelation now</p>
<p>in the Easter season and it&rsquo;s this wild and woolly book.</p>
<p>It should be filmed by Spielberg or somebody today.</p>
<p>And he speaks through the Gospels.</p>
<p>The Gospels correspond in genre</p>
<p>to what I call ancient biography.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the genre of the Gospels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong to call them like mythic or simply literary.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like ancient biographies.</p>
<p>You have the Pauline letters which are about</p>
<p>particular cities that Paul was visiting</p>
<p>and particular people he knew.</p>
<p>So you just gotta be sensitive to the genre all the time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return back to human institutions</p>
<p>and talk about history of human civilization and politics.</p>
<p>So one question to ask is was America founded</p>
<p>as a Christian nation in your view?</p>
<p>If we look at the Declaration of Independence,</p>
<p>what did the words mean?</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self evident</p>
<p>that all men are created equal,</p>
<p>that they are endowed by their creator</p>
<p>with certain inalienable rights</p>
<p>that among these are life, liberty,</p>
<p>and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>It seems like God is breathing through those words too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>The founders would be some kind of combination of deism,</p>
<p>certainly Christianity is coming up through them,</p>
<p>enlightenment, rationalism, all in kind of a mix.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not gonna find in our founding fathers</p>
<p>simply a Thomas Aquinas or like a purely</p>
<p>classically Christian understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Christianity in those various expressions.</p>
<p>Because actually I would see the enlightenment</p>
<p>as a sort of child of Christianity.</p>
<p>We could talk about that.</p>
<p>But having said all that, yes,</p>
<p>I think they are expressing at least the residue</p>
<p>of a once deeply integrated Christian sense of things</p>
<p>that our rights are not created by the government.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doled out by the government.</p>
<p>They come from God.</p>
<p>And the other thing I find really interesting is equality</p>
<p>because look in classical philosophy, political philosophy,</p>
<p>Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, it&rsquo;s not equality.</p>
<p>For them it&rsquo;s our inequality that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So Plato divides us into these three classes</p>
<p>and Aristotle says only a tiny little coterie</p>
<p>of property males of sufficient education</p>
<p>should be in the political life.</p>
<p>The rest should all be in private life.</p>
<p>And then some are suited for slavery.</p>
<p>So I mean he divides us dramatically.</p>
<p>Same with Cicero and so on.</p>
<p>Where does this come from, this weird idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all equal?</p>
<p>I mean how?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not equal in beauty, not equal in strength.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not equal in moral attainment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not equal in intelligence.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>And I think the residue especially comes through</p>
<p>in that little word that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our equality, that we&rsquo;re all equally children of God.</p>
<p>So take God out of the picture.</p>
<p>I think we are gonna slide rapidly</p>
<p>into an embrace of inequality.</p>
<p>Now in the classical world, yes,</p>
<p>but heck, look at the 20th century.</p>
<p>I mean when God is excluded in a very systematic way,</p>
<p>I think you saw the suspension of rights</p>
<p>and the suspension of equality like mad.</p>
<p>So no, I think it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>that God is in the picture and that we&rsquo;re a nation under God.</p>
<p>It matters enormously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not pious boilerplate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at the rational foundations of our democracy.</p>
<p>So do you think Nietzsche was onto something</p>
<p>with the idea, looking into the 20th century,</p>
<p>that God is dead?</p>
<p>That there is a cultural distancing from a belief in God?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d be somewhat sympathetic</p>
<p>to Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s reading of Nietzsche there.</p>
<p>Namely, it&rsquo;s not Nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Hey, God is dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a lament.</p>
<p>God is dead and we&rsquo;ve killed him.</p>
<p>And what will happen in the wake of that?</p>
<p>And I think, yeah, much of the totalitarianism</p>
<p>of the 20th century follows from that questioning of God</p>
<p>and the dismissal of God from public life.</p>
<p>So I would be sympathetic with that.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re beyond good and evil,</p>
<p>and all that&rsquo;s left is the will to power,</p>
<p>and then why are we surprised at the powerful rise</p>
<p>and that they use the powerless for their purposes?</p>
<p>When we forget ideas like equality and rights,</p>
<p>which are grounded in God,</p>
<p>why are we surprised that death camps follow?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a correlation there for sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I believe that there&rsquo;s a capacity</p>
<p>to do good in all of us and a capacity to do evil,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something that tends towards good,</p>
<p>whatever that is.</p>
<p>I tend to think that if that community,</p>
<p>that love that we talked about, they find each other,</p>
<p>they find the good.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t constrain the resources,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t push them,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t artificially create conflict</p>
<p>through power centers and evil charismatic leaders,</p>
<p>then people will be good to each other.</p>
<p>And whether that&rsquo;s God or some other source</p>
<p>of deep moral meaning,</p>
<p>that seems to be essential for a functioning civilization.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard, I mean, that&rsquo;s what humans are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re searching for what that God is, what that means.</p>
<p>You know what that triggers in my mind?</p>
<p>I wonder if you agree with this,</p>
<p>that the modern sciences drew their strength</p>
<p>from their narrowness.</p>
<p>And what I mean there is they almost completely bracketed</p>
<p>formal and final causality in the Aristotelian sense,</p>
<p>and they focused on efficient and material causality.</p>
<p>And that gave, as I say, great strength,</p>
<p>but from the narrowness of focus.</p>
<p>But for Aristotle, the more important causes</p>
<p>are the final and the formal causes.</p>
<p>And so final causality there, what&rsquo;s drawing us?</p>
<p>So for Aristotle, he&rsquo;d look at someone like me and say,</p>
<p>okay, you have a intelligible structure,</p>
<p>and that leads you to seek certain things</p>
<p>for the perfection of that structure, you know?</p>
<p>And fair enough, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I seek the good.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m seeking the good of being with you.</p>
<p>I said, yeah, I&rsquo;ll sit down with Lex Friedman</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about deep and important things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the good I sought this morning when I woke up.</p>
<p>Now, why am I seeking that?</p>
<p>Well, for a higher reason, a higher good, you know?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s part of my work, my ministry is to, you know,</p>
<p>the church reaching out beyond itself to the wider culture,</p>
<p>and okay, well, why do you want that?</p>
<p>Well, because I want to bring more and more people</p>
<p>into what I think is beautiful and true and good</p>
<p>in the church.</p>
<p>Well, how come you want that?</p>
<p>Well, because a long time ago,</p>
<p>I was kind of myself brought into that realm</p>
<p>and find it very compelling.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then why do you want that?</p>
<p>Well, because ultimately, I want to be friends with God.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve given you one example there,</p>
<p>but any act of the will, it seems to me,</p>
<p>has to be analyzed that way.</p>
<p>The will seeks something.</p>
<p>It seeks the good, right, by definition.</p>
<p>But the good always nests like a Russian doll</p>
<p>in a higher good, right,</p>
<p>which then nests into still higher good.</p>
<p>Until you come, this is Aquinas,</p>
<p>to some, in this sense, uncaused cause,</p>
<p>an uncaused final cause,</p>
<p>there has to be some summum bonum, right,</p>
<p>some supreme good that you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s God, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another, I think, rational path to God,</p>
<p>is every single moment, every day,</p>
<p>we are implicitly seeking God.</p>
<p>So with your Word on Fire ministries</p>
<p>and the website and the communication efforts,</p>
<p>what is the thing you&rsquo;re seeking?</p>
<p>Just you, if we can pause and for a brief moment,</p>
<p>allow you to be prideful.</p>
<p>Or, of course, just joking,</p>
<p>but what is your local efforts,</p>
<p>your small little pocket of the world</p>
<p>with small, in quotes, with Word on Fire?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just using the media,</p>
<p>especially the new media, the social media,</p>
<p>to get the gospel out.</p>
<p>So I started, what, 20 some years ago,</p>
<p>just on a radio show in Chicago, 515 on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>I had a 15 minute sermon show.</p>
<p>And I asked the people in this parish I was at,</p>
<p>I said, I need $50,000 to get on for 15 minutes</p>
<p>at 515 on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>And they all laughed when I proposed that,</p>
<p>but they gave me the money.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I got started,</p>
<p>just doing a sermon on the radio.</p>
<p>And then it branched off into video stuff and TV.</p>
<p>And then I did a documentary.</p>
<p>I went all over the world</p>
<p>and kind of told the story of Catholicism.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we started.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m using all the new media and social media.</p>
<p>But what I really love, what we&rsquo;re doing today,</p>
<p>something I really like,</p>
<p>which is having a conversation</p>
<p>outside of just the narrow Catholic world</p>
<p>or even the narrow Christian world,</p>
<p>but to look out to the wider culture</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s talking about interesting things</p>
<p>and how can the church engage there?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the purpose of Word on Fire.</p>
<p>Is it overwhelming to face so many different atheists</p>
<p>than complex thinkers like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>and some of the more political style thinkers</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve spoken with?</p>
<p>Is that, what is it, Dave Rubin,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also has a way different worldview as well?</p>
<p>Is that terrifying?</p>
<p>Is that exciting to you?</p>
<p>Is it challenging?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe all of the above, but more exciting.</p>
<p>I would say I like doing that.</p>
<p>I was a teacher for a long time.</p>
<p>I taught in the seminary for like 20 years.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been engaging these questions for a long time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a writer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about 20 some books.</p>
<p>And I write some at a popular level.</p>
<p>I write some at a high academic level.</p>
<p>And I like doing all that.</p>
<p>So I love those ideas.</p>
<p>I love those questions, love engaging people.</p>
<p>And I find my own experience,</p>
<p>you do run into, of course, a lot of the vitriol</p>
<p>and kind of just stupidity and all that online.</p>
<p>And I get it.</p>
<p>And religion is such a magnet for people&rsquo;s hostility</p>
<p>for different reasons.</p>
<p>So I get that.</p>
<p>Like you read it, we talked about,</p>
<p>you have to wade through swamps of obscenity and everything.</p>
<p>But I do it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worthwhile.</p>
<p>Because in that Reddit experience,</p>
<p>so many of the issues that preoccupy young people,</p>
<p>I can name them for you.</p>
<p>Exactly what they are.</p>
<p>It comes to religion.</p>
<p>How do you know there&rsquo;s a God?</p>
<p>So the God question.</p>
<p>Secondly, why is there so much suffering in the world?</p>
<p>Third question, why do you think your religion</p>
<p>is the right religion?</p>
<p>Fourth, why are you so mean to gay people?</p>
<p>So those are the four things that I, again and again,</p>
<p>come up when dealing with young people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told my brother bishops and priests about that.</p>
<p>I said, structure your adult education programs</p>
<p>or structure your youth outreach</p>
<p>around those four questions.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about gay marriage.</p>
<p>How do we make sense of the love between a man and a man</p>
<p>and a woman and a woman and the institution of marriage?</p>
<p>We love friendship.</p>
<p>And friendship is at the heart of things.</p>
<p>And so nothing wrong with friendship</p>
<p>between a man and a man, a woman and a woman.</p>
<p>But go back to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas</p>
<p>about natural finalities and intelligible forms,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a certain form to human being,</p>
<p>which includes the physical and includes the sexual.</p>
<p>It has a proper finality.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;d recognize that finality is twofold,</p>
<p>both unitive and procreative.</p>
<p>And so those two we recognize</p>
<p>as the appropriate expression of human sexuality.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the church holds to sex</p>
<p>between a man and a woman within the context of marriage</p>
<p>is the right expression.</p>
<p>We reach out to everybody in love and in respect</p>
<p>and deep understanding and seeking to understand</p>
<p>their lives from the inside.</p>
<p>So I mean, all of that,</p>
<p>I agree with the bridge building that we need to do</p>
<p>to people like in the gay community</p>
<p>and people in gay marriage and so on.</p>
<p>So the church holds to the intelligible structure,</p>
<p>if you want, of human sexuality</p>
<p>and it reaches out to real human beings</p>
<p>always in an attitude of invitation and love and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s somewhere in there</p>
<p>that the church takes its stance.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s probably variation</p>
<p>in the stances that it takes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying the institution of marriage</p>
<p>is about the unitive, which is like the friendship,</p>
<p>the deep connection between two humans and the procreative.</p>
<p>So being able to have children and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So is our gay couples seen as sinful?</p>
<p>So does the church acknowledge the love?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the deep love that&rsquo;s possible between a man and a man.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is why the church says in its official teaching,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the physical expression, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>of sexual passion between two men that is problematic,</p>
<p>not their friendship, not their love for each other.</p>
<p>So I think, yeah, we confirm the first.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you another difficult topic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just happening.</p>
<p>Unlike the other ones we talked about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going on in the news now.</p>
<p>As we sit here today, the Supreme Court has voted</p>
<p>to overturn abortion rights in a draft majority opinion</p>
<p>striking down the landmark Roe versus Wade decision.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>First of all, the human institution of the Supreme Court</p>
<p>making these decisions throughout its history.</p>
<p>And second of all, just the idea, the really powerful,</p>
<p>the controversial, the difficult idea of abortion.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m against abortion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pro life.</p>
<p>The church recognizes from the moment of conception,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing with a human life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worthy of respect and protection.</p>
<p>Especially as you see the unfolding of that person</p>
<p>across a pregnancy.</p>
<p>But at every stage, we recognize the beauty</p>
<p>and the dignity of that human being.</p>
<p>And so we stand opposed to this,</p>
<p>the outright killing of the innocent.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the church&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>Again, reaching out always in love and understanding</p>
<p>and compassion to those who are dealing.</p>
<p>And believe me, every single pastor, every single priest</p>
<p>understands that, because we deal with people all the time</p>
<p>who are in these painful situations.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the moral side of it.</p>
<p>The legal side, I think Roe v. Wade was terribly decided.</p>
<p>I think one of the worst expressions of American law</p>
<p>since the Dred Scott decision.</p>
<p>So I stand in favor of a returning Roe v. Wade and Casey.</p>
<p>I think they were terrible.</p>
<p>The Casey decision is instructive to me.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nature of freedom, that decision says,</p>
<p>to determine the meaning of one&rsquo;s own life.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t get the language exactly right,</p>
<p>but end of the universe.</p>
<p>Like it gives this staggering scope to our freedom,</p>
<p>that we can determine the meaning.</p>
<p>See, but that&rsquo;s repugnant to everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just talked about.</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m inventing the meaning of my life</p>
<p>and of the universe.</p>
<p>And so Casey, though, was instructive in a way</p>
<p>because it tips its hat toward the problem culturally,</p>
<p>is that I think in my freedom, I can determine everything.</p>
<p>My choice is all that matters.</p>
<p>And I would say, no, your choice should be correlated</p>
<p>to the order of the good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sovereign.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t reign sovereignly over being</p>
<p>and it makes its own decisions.</p>
<p>So I think Casey was terrible law</p>
<p>and it was backing up Roe v. Wade, which is terrible law.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in favor of the overturning of those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken out that many times.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;ll return it to the individual states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna solve the problem.</p>
<p>The individual states will have to decide.</p>
<p>I just heard yesterday, we were up in Sacramento,</p>
<p>the bishops having our annual meeting.</p>
<p>And so we got the word from the governor and the legislators</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna push for a constitutional amendment</p>
<p>in California.</p>
<p>So basically to make any attempt to limit abortion</p>
<p>in any way just illegal.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s barbaric.</p>
<p>So I stand radically opposed to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting line</p>
<p>because if you believe that there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a line that struggles with the question</p>
<p>of what does it mean to be a living being</p>
<p>or to give life to something.</p>
<p>Because if you believe that at the moment of conception</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically creating a human life,</p>
<p>then abortion is murder.</p>
<p>And then if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s a sort of basic biological choice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not taking away of a life.</p>
<p>And the gap between those two beliefs is so vast</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard and yet so fundamental</p>
<p>to the question of what it means to be alive</p>
<p>and the fundamental question about the respect</p>
<p>for human life and human dignity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see.</p>
<p>And also about freedom too.</p>
<p>All of those things are mixed in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful struggle.</p>
<p>Maybe the freedom is the most important,</p>
<p>this sort of freedom run amok.</p>
<p>Or in classical philosophy and theology,</p>
<p>freedom is not self determination.</p>
<p>Freedom is the disciplining of desire</p>
<p>so as to make the achievement of the good</p>
<p>first possible and then effortless.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>So modern freedom and the roots of that</p>
<p>are people like William of Ockham in the late Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Freedom means I hover above the yes and the no.</p>
<p>Do I do yes or no?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m the sovereign subject of that choice.</p>
<p>And on no basis I will say yes or no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like Louis XIV or I&rsquo;m like Stalin or something.</p>
<p>But Aquinas wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized that as freedom.</p>
<p>For him, I got this desire in me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this will and it&rsquo;s pushing toward the good.</p>
<p>But the trouble is I got so many attachments</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so stupid and I&rsquo;m so conditioned by my sin</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t achieve it.</p>
<p>So I need to be disciplined in my desire</p>
<p>so as to make that achievement possible</p>
<p>and then effortless so right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m freely speaking English to you.</p>
<p>And you had the experience and I&rsquo;ve had it too</p>
<p>of learning a foreign language.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you feel unfree?</p>
<p>You know, like when you&rsquo;re struggling with a language.</p>
<p>When I was over in Paris doing my doctoral work</p>
<p>and I was okay with French,</p>
<p>but my first time in a seminar</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these intelligent francophones</p>
<p>around the table and they&rsquo;re all just,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to say my little thing in my awkward French.</p>
<p>And I felt unfree because my desire wasn&rsquo;t directed.</p>
<p>But then over time I became freer</p>
<p>and freer speaker of French.</p>
<p>I was ordered more to the good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a better understanding of freedom</p>
<p>than sort of sovereign self determination.</p>
<p>But our country is now I think really in the grip of that.</p>
<p>I decide and that&rsquo;s where the Nietzschean thing</p>
<p>comes to my mind of the will to power.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beyond good and evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just up to me to decide.</p>
<p>God help us.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the values that we intuit around us.</p>
<p>Intellectual, moral and aesthetic, the values.</p>
<p>Think of the dog on the beach again.</p>
<p>And that you get ordered to those</p>
<p>by your education, by your family, by your religion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>That makes you free.</p>
<p>Now I can freely enter into this.</p>
<p>So this sovereign self determination business,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not my game.</p>
<p>The values come in part from the tradition</p>
<p>carried through the generations.</p>
<p>Let me ask you to put on your wise hat</p>
<p>and give advice to young folks.</p>
<p>So high school and college,</p>
<p>thinking about what to do with their life,</p>
<p>career, there&rsquo;s so many options out there.</p>
<p>How can they have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or even just a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d say find something you&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s from God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gift that God&rsquo;s given you.</p>
<p>And then dedicate it to love.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good at science or math or sports or whatever.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna use that now for my aggrandizement,</p>
<p>for my wealth, for my privileges and to become famous.</p>
<p>No, no, no, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Find what you&rsquo;re good at,</p>
<p>but now dedicate it to willing the good of the other.</p>
<p>So use your science and use your mathematics</p>
<p>and use your sports and use your musicianship</p>
<p>to benefit the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d say them.</p>
<p>So find what you&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from God.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>Finding what you&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just raw skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also what you connect with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also like this iterative process</p>
<p>of if you wanna add love to the world,</p>
<p>you have to see how can you be effective at doing that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the things you&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m good at building bridges out of toothpicks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure that&rsquo;s going to be useful for the world.</p>
<p>Then again, to push back on that,</p>
<p>the joy brings me, maybe somehow the joy radiates out.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you&rsquo;re good at what you&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve dedicated that to bringing more light</p>
<p>and illumination and joy to the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That was a searching.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a process of trying stuff and figuring it out.</p>
<p>And ultimately, yes, asking the question,</p>
<p>how is this making the world at all better</p>
<p>at every step of the way</p>
<p>as opposed to enriching yourself</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Right, I think that&rsquo;s the name of the game.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t have moral mentors</p>
<p>and intellectual mentors, it becomes hard.</p>
<p>And if you tell a kid, that&rsquo;s deadly to me,</p>
<p>just decide for yourself, just off you go.</p>
<p>And you make your own choices.</p>
<p>I mean, your choice has to be disciplined.</p>
<p>Your desire has gotta be directed.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ll find your creative path.</p>
<p>Everyone does it in its own way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a guided choice.</p>
<p>Your freedom is not sovereign.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a guided freedom.</p>
<p>So in the struggle and the suffering</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen in the world,</p>
<p>let me ask you the question of death.</p>
<p>How often do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>And one, are you afraid of it, the uncertainty of it?</p>
<p>And what do you think happens after you die?</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;m afraid of it.</p>
<p>I mean, because I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t know it the way I know you.</p>
<p>So of course I&rsquo;m afraid of it.</p>
<p>And I think of it every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>My prayer life compels me.</p>
<p>We have this, the Hail Mary prayer.</p>
<p>So you pray the rosary.</p>
<p>Now and at the hour of our death, amen.</p>
<p>Now at the hour of our death, amen.</p>
<p>You pray the whole rosary.</p>
<p>50 times you&rsquo;ve reminded yourself of your own death.</p>
<p>But I do.</p>
<p>I think about it because it&rsquo;s the ultimate limit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s beguiled every artist and writer</p>
<p>and philosopher.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ultimate limit question.</p>
<p>But yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of it because it&rsquo;s the unknown.</p>
<p>What do I think happens?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m drawn into the deeper embrace of God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s stating it kind of in a more poetic way.</p>
<p>Do you know John Polkinghorne&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>Do you know that name?</p>
<p>John Polkinghorne was a very interesting,</p>
<p>he just died recently.</p>
<p>He was a Cambridge University particle physicist, right?</p>
<p>High, high level scientist who at midlife</p>
<p>became an Anglican priest.</p>
<p>He left his job at Cambridge and went to the seminary</p>
<p>and became an Anglican priest, right?</p>
<p>And then wrote, I think some of the best stuff</p>
<p>on science and religion,</p>
<p>because he really knew the science from the inside.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Polkinghorne&rsquo;s account</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve always found persuasive.</p>
<p>He said, what survives after we die?</p>
<p>So this body clearly dies and goes into the ground</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s burned up or it goes away, right?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s preserved?</p>
<p>And he says, what Aristotle would have called the form,</p>
<p>Polkinghorne calls it the pattern.</p>
<p>So the pattern that&rsquo;s organized the matter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s made me up over all these years,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s obviously not the same as it was even,</p>
<p>I mean, you would know how often does it all change,</p>
<p>all your atoms and cells and, you know.</p>
<p>In other words, the little, you know,</p>
<p>Bobby Baron who was growing up in Birmingham, Michigan,</p>
<p>I can have a picture of him and then there&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>And I say, oh, that&rsquo;s the same person.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, clearly not materially speaking, not at all.</p>
<p>Completely different.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a unity to whatever that pattern is</p>
<p>by which all of that materiality</p>
<p>has been kind of organized, you know?</p>
<p>So Polkinghorne says, I think that pattern is remembered</p>
<p>by God and remember it&rsquo;s the wrong word,</p>
<p>as though it&rsquo;s like derivative.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s known by God.</p>
<p>And so God can therefore reembody me</p>
<p>according to that pattern at a higher pitch,</p>
<p>what we call the resurrected body.</p>
<p>So Paul talks about a spiritual body,</p>
<p>body for sure, I mean,</p>
<p>because he believes in the resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a body like ours from this world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a body at a higher pitch.</p>
<p>So something, some pattern that&rsquo;s there persists.</p>
<p>Pattern persists in the mind of God</p>
<p>and then is used as the ground of the reembodyment of me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve just become a platonic form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be reembodyed because the Christian hope</p>
<p>is not for platonic escape of soul from matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never the Christian hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the resurrection of the body,</p>
<p>we say.</p>
<p>And you say, what a fantastic idea.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, this body is being reconstituted all the time</p>
<p>according to this pattern, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same matter.</p>
<p>And so might there be another sort of higher material</p>
<p>that is organized according to the same pattern,</p>
<p>which has been remembered by God.</p>
<p>So therefore we can hang on to the language of body and soul</p>
<p>if you want, or matter and form.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the form remembered by God</p>
<p>and then reconstituted in an embodied way by God</p>
<p>that we call heaven, the heavenly state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I hope for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my Christian faith, my Christian hope.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the big question of meaning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about it in different directions</p>
<p>from different perspectives.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of our existence here on earth?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>God is love.</p>
<p>And the purpose of my life is to become God&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>And that means I&rsquo;m more conformed to love.</p>
<p>And so my life finds meaning in the measure</p>
<p>that I become more on fire with the divine love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like the burning bush,</p>
<p>is to become more and more radiant with the presence of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gives life meaning.</p>
<p>Meaning is to live in a purposive relationship</p>
<p>to a value, I would say.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all kinds of values,</p>
<p>as I say, moral, aesthetic, intellectual values.</p>
<p>And when I have a purposive relationship,</p>
<p>so right now you and I,</p>
<p>we have a purposive relationship to the value of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, finding out the truth of things,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re speaking together to seek that.</p>
<p>Well, good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the ultimate value?</p>
<p>The value of values is God.</p>
<p>The supreme good, the supremely knowable,</p>
<p>the supremely intelligible is God.</p>
<p>And so to be conformed to God</p>
<p>is to have a fully meaningful life.</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>God is love.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I would fit the package together that way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re adding a lot of love to this world,</p>
<p>and which is something I deeply appreciate,</p>
<p>and that you would sit down with me,</p>
<p>given how valuable your time is,</p>
<p>is a huge honor.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Well, my great pleasure.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>Lex, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Bishop Robert Barron.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Bishop Robert Barron himself,</p>
<p>which reminds me of the Dostoevsky line</p>
<p>spoken through Prince Mishkin,</p>
<p>that quote, beauty will save the world.</p>
<p>Robert says, begin with the beautiful,</p>
<p>which leads to the good,</p>
<p>which leads you to truth.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening,</p>
<p>and hope to see you next time.</p>
