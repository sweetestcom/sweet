    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss the use</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure for health and performance.</p>
<p>Temperature is a powerful stimulus on our nervous system</p>
<p>and indeed on every organ and system of our body.</p>
<p>And cold in particular can be leveraged</p>
<p>to improve mental health, physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>meaning for endurance exercise,</p>
<p>for recovering from various forms of exercise,</p>
<p>for actually improving strength and power,</p>
<p>and for enhancing mental capacity.</p>
<p>In order to properly leverage deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for sake of mental health, physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>you have to understand how cold impacts the brain and body.</p>
<p>So today we are going to discuss that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>some of the neural circuits and pathways,</p>
<p>some of the hormones involved.</p>
<p>I promise to make it all clear and accessible</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you have a scientific background or not.</p>
<p>We are also going to discuss very specific protocols</p>
<p>that you can apply,</p>
<p>which leverage variables like temperature, how cold,</p>
<p>how to deliver the cold,</p>
<p>for instance, whether or not you use a cold shower,</p>
<p>cold immersion, ice bath, circulating water, or still water,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re going for walks outside in a T-shirt</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s cold,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re purposefully using things</p>
<p>like cryo, if you have access to that or not.</p>
<p>One thing I can promise you</p>
<p>is that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will know a lot about the biology of thermal regulation.</p>
<p>That is how your brain and body regulates its temperature.</p>
<p>You will also have a lot of tools in your arsenal</p>
<p>that you can use and leverage</p>
<p>toward improving mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>reducing inflammation in the body,</p>
<p>improving athletic performance,</p>
<p>improving mental performance.</p>
<p>I promise to spell out all those protocols in detail</p>
<p>as I go along and to summarize them again at the end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make a point now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to make several additional times</p>
<p>during today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>And that is that temperature is a very potent stimulus</p>
<p>for the brain and body.</p>
<p>That also means that it carries certain hazards</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not done correctly.</p>
<p>Now, everyone shows up to the table,</p>
<p>meaning to protocols,</p>
<p>with a different background of health status.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s simply no way that I can know</p>
<p>what your health status is.</p>
<p>So anytime you are going to take on a new protocol,</p>
<p>that means a behavioral protocol or a nutritional protocol</p>
<p>or a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>you should absolutely consult a board-certified physician</p>
<p>before initiating that protocol.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say this to protect us,</p>
<p>I also say this to protect you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see our medical disclaimer,</p>
<p>you can go to our show notes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s described there.</p>
<p>In fact, I encourage you to please do that.</p>
<p>And in general, when embarking on new protocols,</p>
<p>in particular, if they involve strong stimuli</p>
<p>like changing temperature</p>
<p>or placing yourself into unusual temperatures,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to progress gradually.</p>
<p>I would also encourage you to not look at gradual progression</p>
<p>as the kind of weak version of a protocol.</p>
<p>In fact, today I&rsquo;m going to discuss</p>
<p>a really beautiful peer-reviewed study</p>
<p>that involved having people do deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So they were immersing themselves into water</p>
<p>up to about their neck.</p>
<p>And the water was actually not that cold.</p>
<p>It was only about 60 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>which for most people is pretty tolerable.</p>
<p>So nowhere near the kinds of extreme temperatures</p>
<p>that one could use in other protocols.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is,</p>
<p>despite that fairly modest cold temperature,</p>
<p>by simply extending the duration of time</p>
<p>that people were in that water,</p>
<p>they experienced enormous increases in neurochemicals</p>
<p>that ought to translate to improvements in focus and mood.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been observed</p>
<p>in subsequent studies.</p>
<p>So again, please see our medical disclaimer</p>
<p>in our show notes.</p>
<p>Please proceed with caution always.</p>
<p>Please also understand that the most potent stimulus</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t always the one that you experience</p>
<p>as the most intense in the moment.</p>
<p>In fact, I would encourage you to find</p>
<p>the minimum threshold of stimulus</p>
<p>that will allow you to derive the maximum benefit</p>
<p>from each protocol.</p>
<p>And indeed, I will point out</p>
<p>what those thresholds ought to be today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some simple formulas,</p>
<p>gauges or guides that you can use</p>
<p>in order to navigate this extremely interesting</p>
<p>and potent tool that we call deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Before we talk about deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>and its many powerful applications,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to highlight a study</p>
<p>that I find particularly interesting</p>
<p>and that I think you will find</p>
<p>particularly interesting and useful.</p>
<p>The title of this study is,</p>
<p>brief aerobic exercise immediately enhances</p>
<p>visual attentional control and perceptual speed,</p>
<p>testing the mediating role of feelings of energy.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I like this study is,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s a fairly large size sample group.</p>
<p>They looked at 101 students.</p>
<p>These were college age students,</p>
<p>and they had two groups.</p>
<p>One group did 15 minutes of jogging at moderate intensity.</p>
<p>So when they did measure percent heart rates, et cetera,</p>
<p>but this would be analogous to zone two cardio,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve discussed on this podcast before.</p>
<p>Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>that places you at a level where you can hold a conversation</p>
<p>with a little bit of strain,</p>
<p>meaning that you can get the words out,</p>
<p>but every once in a while you have to catch your breath.</p>
<p>Whereas if you were to push any harder</p>
<p>by any mechanism going faster or on a steeper incline,</p>
<p>et cetera, that you would have a hard time</p>
<p>carrying out a conversation.</p>
<p>So zone two cardio is a common form</p>
<p>of describing that level of intensity</p>
<p>that they call moderate intensity.</p>
<p>So one group did 15 minutes of jogging</p>
<p>at moderate intensity,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m translating to roughly zone two cardio.</p>
<p>The other group did 15 minutes of relaxation concentration</p>
<p>that is somewhat akin to mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>And then they were analyzed for perceptual speed,</p>
<p>visual attentional control,</p>
<p>something called working memory,</p>
<p>which is your ability to keep certain batches</p>
<p>of information online.</p>
<p>Just imagine someone telling you their phone number</p>
<p>and you have to remember that sequence of numbers</p>
<p>in your head for some period of time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s working memory.</p>
<p>And it depends very heavily</p>
<p>on the so-called prefrontal cortical networks,</p>
<p>which are involved in planning and action.</p>
<p>And they also looked at people&rsquo;s feelings of energy</p>
<p>and they measured that subjectively,</p>
<p>how energetic people felt.</p>
<p>Now, the major takeaways from the study</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to emphasize are that</p>
<p>the 15 minutes of jogging group experienced</p>
<p>elevated levels of energy for some period of time</p>
<p>after they ceased the exercise.</p>
<p>Whereas the group that did mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>actually reported feeling more calm</p>
<p>and having less overall energy.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s very subjective.</p>
<p>And indeed they used subjective measures to analyze energy.</p>
<p>But what gets interesting is when they looked at</p>
<p>performance on these various cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>And the two tasks that they use</p>
<p>were called the trail-making tests.</p>
<p>They have different versions of this,</p>
<p>version A, version B.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into too much detail,</p>
<p>but version A essentially involves</p>
<p>having a page of numbers that are distributed</p>
<p>somewhat randomly.</p>
<p>So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so on,</p>
<p>but distributed randomly across the page.</p>
<p>And people have to use visual search</p>
<p>to circle those numbers in sequence.</p>
<p>So this involves visual attention.</p>
<p>It involves some motor skills,</p>
<p>involves a number of things that</p>
<p>certainly require energy and focus.</p>
<p>The second test was the trail-making test part B,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>And this involved also circling numbers in sequence,</p>
<p>but interspersed between those numbers were letters.</p>
<p>So rather than just having to circle off numbers</p>
<p>in sequence, they actually had to connect one,</p>
<p>then the letter A, then two, then the letter B, et cetera.</p>
<p>And remember, these are randomly distributed across a page.</p>
<p>The major takeaway from the study is that</p>
<p>the group that did the 15 minutes of moderate exercise</p>
<p>prior to these two tests showed significant decreases</p>
<p>in the amount of time required</p>
<p>to complete these tests accurately.</p>
<p>That is interesting and indeed surprising,</p>
<p>at least to me, because there have been many studies</p>
<p>looking at the effects of mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>on the ability to focus.</p>
<p>The key variable in the study turned out to be energy.</p>
<p>This feeling, subjectively measured feeling, I should say,</p>
<p>of having more energy and thereby the ability to focus,</p>
<p>especially in these high cognitive demand tasks.</p>
<p>Now, the takeaway from this study for all of us,</p>
<p>I think is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>If you are going to sit down to do some work</p>
<p>that requires focus and working memory</p>
<p>and cognitive attention,</p>
<p>and especially if it&rsquo;s some visual spatial control,</p>
<p>meaning you have to search for things on a page,</p>
<p>you have to organize things on a page,</p>
<p>so this would be writing, arithmetic,</p>
<p>basically cognitive work of any kind,</p>
<p>15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior to that work bout</p>
<p>could be very beneficial for you.</p>
<p>This does not mean that mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>would not be a benefit to you.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to conclude that,</p>
<p>but if you had to choose between doing 15 minutes</p>
<p>of mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>and doing 15 minutes of moderate exercise</p>
<p>prior to a cognitive work bout,</p>
<p>I would say the 15 minutes of moderate exercise</p>
<p>would be more valuable,</p>
<p>at least based on the data in this paper.</p>
<p>In many previous podcasts,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the powerful effects</p>
<p>of doing things like mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>and other forms of NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>so these could be 20 minute naps</p>
<p>or just lying there quietly with your eyes closed</p>
<p>or yoga nidra or NSDR scripts are available on YouTube</p>
<p>and various other places free of cost of any kind.</p>
<p>You can just go to YouTube, put in NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>Those protocols have been shown to be very beneficial</p>
<p>for enhancing neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the changes in the brain and body that encode</p>
<p>or shift the neural circuits</p>
<p>that allow for memory to change,</p>
<p>that allow for learning to occur after a learning bout.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to today in this particular study</p>
<p>is the use of moderate exercise</p>
<p>in order to increase one&rsquo;s focus and attention</p>
<p>in order to trigger that neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So the simple sequence here is get energetic and alert,</p>
<p>do that prior to the learning bout,</p>
<p>engage in the cognitive work or learning bout,</p>
<p>and then mindfulness meditation, NSDR and so forth</p>
<p>should follow.</p>
<p>And if you would like to access this paper</p>
<p>and like to look more at the details in the paper,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be sure to put a link in the show notes.</p>
<p>The first author is Legrand.</p>
<p>And again, the title of this paper is</p>
<p>brief aerobic exercise immediately enhances</p>
<p>visual attentional control and perceptual speed,</p>
<p>testing the mediating role of feelings of energy.</p>
<p>And I also just want to emphasize immediately,</p>
<p>I think most people out there are interested in tools</p>
<p>and protocols that work the first time</p>
<p>and that work every time.</p>
<p>And indeed, I think this protocol fits that bill.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything</p>
<p>you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure that you&rsquo;re staying</p>
<p>on top of your hydration and that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about the use of cold</p>
<p>for health and performance.</p>
<p>I confess I love this topic</p>
<p>because it takes me back to my undergraduate years</p>
<p>when I worked in a laboratory studying cold physiology,</p>
<p>its effects on the brain and its effects on the body.</p>
<p>And over the years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always kept track of the literature in this area.</p>
<p>And indeed, there have been some tremendous discoveries,</p>
<p>both in animal models, so in rodents like mice and rats,</p>
<p>but also in humans.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>both categories of studies,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be careful to point out</p>
<p>when discoveries were made in animal models</p>
<p>and when they were made in humans.</p>
<p>A key point when thinking about the use of cold as a tool,</p>
<p>and the key point is that you have a baseline level</p>
<p>of temperature that is varying,</p>
<p>changing across the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>So any use of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>is going to be superimposed on that rhythm,</p>
<p>that circadian rhythm, meaning that 24-hour rhythm.</p>
<p>The basic contour of your circadian rhythm in temperature</p>
<p>is that approximately two hours</p>
<p>before the time you wake up</p>
<p>is your so-called temperature minimum.</p>
<p>So your temperature minimum is a time</p>
<p>within the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>when your body temperature is at its lowest.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you normally wake up around 6 a.m.,</p>
<p>your temperature minimum is probably about 4 a.m.</p>
<p>If you normally wake up at about 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>your temperature minimum is probably about 5 a.m.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly two hours before your wake-up time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s approximately two hours before your wake-up time.</p>
<p>Now, as you go from your temperature minimum</p>
<p>to the time in which you are going to awake,</p>
<p>your temperature is rising slightly.</p>
<p>And then at the point where you wake up,</p>
<p>your temperature starts to go up more sharply</p>
<p>and will continue to go up into the early</p>
<p>and sometimes even into the late afternoon.</p>
<p>And then sometime in the late afternoon and evening,</p>
<p>your temperature will start to decline.</p>
<p>And indeed, as you approach sleep,</p>
<p>your body temperature will drop</p>
<p>by anywhere from one to three degrees.</p>
<p>And in fact, that decrease in core body temperature</p>
<p>is important, if not essential,</p>
<p>for getting into and staying in deep sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, so temperature rises with waking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easy to remember.</p>
<p>It tends to continue to rise throughout the day.</p>
<p>And in the late afternoon and evening,</p>
<p>your temperature will start to go down</p>
<p>and the drop in temperature actually helps you access sleep.</p>
<p>That background, or what we call baseline,</p>
<p>circadian rhythm in core body temperature</p>
<p>is important to remember because it helps us frame</p>
<p>both the effects of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>and it helps us frame when you might want to use</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure in order to access specific states.</p>
<p>It also points to times within the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>when you might want to avoid using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>if your primary goal is to get to sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the circadian rhythm in temperature.</p>
<p>Now, I just briefly want to touch on thermal regulation</p>
<p>at the level of the body and the brain.</p>
<p>And this will be very surprising to many of you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do what&rsquo;s called a Gedanken experiment,</p>
<p>which is a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I send you out into the desert heat</p>
<p>for a jog or a run, and it&rsquo;s very hot outside,</p>
<p>you know, 102 degrees or 103 degrees.</p>
<p>And you start to move, you start to sweat,</p>
<p>and of course your core body temperature goes up.</p>
<p>Now, then I offer you a cold towel,</p>
<p>maybe a really, really cold towel.</p>
<p>And this towel is saturated with water</p>
<p>so you could actually squeeze the water out of that</p>
<p>and cool your body off.</p>
<p>And our Gedanken experiment is for me to say,</p>
<p>okay, where are you going to place the towel?</p>
<p>How are you going to cool yourself off?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing that most of you would think</p>
<p>that the best way to cool yourself off</p>
<p>would be to drape that towel over your head,</p>
<p>maybe your neck, over your torso,</p>
<p>and that it would feel really, really good</p>
<p>and they would cool you off.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly the wrong approach</p>
<p>if you want to cool off.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you were to use that approach,</p>
<p>your body temperature would continue to increase even more.</p>
<p>Yes, even more than had you not placed that cold towel</p>
<p>on your head or your torso.</p>
<p>And here is why.</p>
<p>Thermal regulation, meaning your brain and body&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to regulate your internal core temperature</p>
<p>is somewhat like a thermostat.</p>
<p>And that thermostat resides in your brain.</p>
<p>So if you think about the thermostat</p>
<p>in your home or apartment,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s too warm in your home or apartment,</p>
<p>and you were to take a bag of ice</p>
<p>and to put it on that thermostat,</p>
<p>what would the thermostat do?</p>
<p>It would register the environment as artificially cool.</p>
<p>It would think that the environment</p>
<p>was actually much colder than it is.</p>
<p>And so as a consequence,</p>
<p>it would trigger a mechanism</p>
<p>to further increase the temperature in the room.</p>
<p>And you have such a thermostat as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus is a small region of brain tissue</p>
<p>about over the roof of your mouth</p>
<p>and a little bit in front of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically right behind your nose</p>
<p>and over the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a collection of neurons.</p>
<p>Those neurons have a lot of different functions</p>
<p>that include things like the control of aggression,</p>
<p>the control of sex behavior,</p>
<p>the control of temperature regulation and so on.</p>
<p>The medial preoptic area has connections</p>
<p>with the rest of the brain</p>
<p>or areas within the brain, I should say.</p>
<p>And with many areas within the body,</p>
<p>it receives input from receptors in our skin</p>
<p>and inside our body that register temperature</p>
<p>and it acts as a thermostat.</p>
<p>So if the surface of your body is made cool,</p>
<p>your medial preoptic area will send signals</p>
<p>by way of hormones and by way of chemicals</p>
<p>that will serve to heat your body up.</p>
<p>So what this means is that if you want to cool down,</p>
<p>the last thing you want to do</p>
<p>is to bring a cold surface of any kind,</p>
<p>towel or splashing water,</p>
<p>to the majority of your body surface.</p>
<p>It might be very, very surprising to you.</p>
<p>And you might say, wait, if I want to cool down,</p>
<p>I should jump into a cold lake or something of that sort.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different thing altogether.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get into this in more depth later,</p>
<p>is that if you really want to cool down</p>
<p>quickly and efficiently,</p>
<p>you should leverage particular portals,</p>
<p>meaning particular sites on your body</p>
<p>where heat can leave your body more readily</p>
<p>and where cooling can have a dramatic and fast impact</p>
<p>on your core body temperature.</p>
<p>It can even save your life if you&rsquo;re going hyperthermic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk more about the specific protocols</p>
<p>to reduce core body temperature for sake of performance</p>
<p>and avoiding hyperthermia later in the episode.</p>
<p>Hyperthermia, of course,</p>
<p>is a very, very dangerous situation</p>
<p>because while your body can drop in core temperature</p>
<p>somewhat and still be safe,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really increase your body temperature that much</p>
<p>before your brain starts to cook</p>
<p>and other organs start to cook.</p>
<p>And by cook, I mean the cells actually start to die.</p>
<p>So you have to be very, very careful with the use of heat.</p>
<p>Heat stroke is no joke.</p>
<p>People die from heat stroke all the time.</p>
<p>You really want to avoid that.</p>
<p>One way to avoid that</p>
<p>is to cool the appropriate surfaces of your body.</p>
<p>And the appropriate surfaces in this case</p>
<p>are the upper cheeks,</p>
<p>or I would say the upper half of the face,</p>
<p>the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this on the podcast before</p>
<p>and in the guest episode with Dr. Craig Heller,</p>
<p>my colleague in the biology department at Stanford.</p>
<p>But just very briefly, these surfaces,</p>
<p>the upper half of the face,</p>
<p>the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet</p>
<p>are what we call glabrous skin surfaces,</p>
<p>G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S, glabrous.</p>
<p>And those surfaces are unique in that just below them,</p>
<p>the vasculature is different than elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>Normally the passage of blood goes from arteries</p>
<p>to capillaries to veins,</p>
<p>but just beneath the glabrous skin</p>
<p>on the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>the hands and the upper half of the face,</p>
<p>you have what are called arteriovenous asthmosis.</p>
<p>These are portals of blood</p>
<p>that go directly from arteries to veins.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>allow the body to dump heat more readily, more quickly.</p>
<p>So as it turns out that if you are to cool</p>
<p>the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet</p>
<p>and the upper half of the face,</p>
<p>you can more efficiently reduce core body temperature</p>
<p>for sake of offsetting hyperthermia</p>
<p>and for improving athletic performance</p>
<p>and maybe even cognitive performance.</p>
<p>So we will return to the specific protocols for doing that</p>
<p>later in the episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a lot of details about how to do that,</p>
<p>how to do that without the use of any fancy</p>
<p>or expensive technology.</p>
<p>There are some technologies</p>
<p>that are now commercially available.</p>
<p>For instance, the so-called cool mitt</p>
<p>that will allow you to do that with maximum efficiency,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll also give you some at-home methods to do this</p>
<p>either in the gym or on runs or for sake of cognitive work.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the two key themes again are understand</p>
<p>that baseline circadian rhythm in temperature</p>
<p>and understand that the best way to cool the body</p>
<p>is going to be by making sure that something cold</p>
<p>contacts the bottoms of your feet,</p>
<p>the palms of your hands and the upper half of the face.</p>
<p>Ideally all three,</p>
<p>if your goal is to lower core body temperature quickly.</p>
<p>And again, just cooling off the back of your neck</p>
<p>or the top of your head or your torso with a towel</p>
<p>is going to be the least efficient way</p>
<p>to lower core body temperature</p>
<p>and might even increase body temperature</p>
<p>under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>With those two points in mind,</p>
<p>we can start to think about directed</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure protocols.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different reasons</p>
<p>to use deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>And I want to separate those out for you.</p>
<p>There are cold protocols that have been tested</p>
<p>in peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that are designed to improve mental performance.</p>
<p>They are designed to improve things like resilience</p>
<p>or your grittiness or your ability to move through challenge</p>
<p>or to regulate your mind and your internal state</p>
<p>under conditions of stress.</p>
<p>And we can define stress very specifically</p>
<p>as times when adrenaline also called epinephrine</p>
<p>and or norepinephrine also called noradrenaline</p>
<p>are elevated in your body.</p>
<p>Forgive me for the noradrenaline, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make that up.</p>
<p>It turns out that every once in a while scientists disagree.</p>
<p>Imagine that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get multiple scientists</p>
<p>naming the same molecule different things.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing.</p>
<p>I will use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine and noradrenaline are the same thing.</p>
<p>I will use those terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>Noradrenaline and adrenaline are often co-released</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>So they work as kind of a pair</p>
<p>to increase our level of agitation,</p>
<p>our level of focus and our desire and our ability to move.</p>
<p>They are often co-released from different sites</p>
<p>in the brain and body with dopamine,</p>
<p>a molecule that is commonly misunderstood</p>
<p>as the molecule of pleasure,</p>
<p>but is actually the molecule of motivation,</p>
<p>reward and pursuit.</p>
<p>So dopamine, norepinephrine and noradrenaline</p>
<p>tend to be released together under certain conditions.</p>
<p>And today you will learn how deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can be used to cause increases in the release of several,</p>
<p>if not all of these in ways that can improve</p>
<p>your levels of attention and your mood.</p>
<p>But the key point is that your mental state is shifted</p>
<p>when you are exposed to certain forms of cold.</p>
<p>And many people use deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>specifically to shift their body state</p>
<p>as a way to train their mental state</p>
<p>so that they can better cope with stress in real life.</p>
<p>And by real life,</p>
<p>I mean when life presents stressful events.</p>
<p>And I will give you specific protocols</p>
<p>as to how you can do that.</p>
<p>In other words, how you can become more resilient</p>
<p>through the use of deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Now, because of the ways in which deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can increase this category of chemicals</p>
<p>called the catecholamines,</p>
<p>that includes dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>it can also be used to elevate mood</p>
<p>for long periods of time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to discuss a specific protocol</p>
<p>that has been shown to increase these chemicals</p>
<p>anywhere from 2.5X, so 250%,</p>
<p>to as high as 500%, five times over baseline.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking whether or not it is a good thing</p>
<p>to raise chemicals like norepinephrine and dopamine</p>
<p>to such a great degree,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s healthy for us,</p>
<p>whether or not they can harm us.</p>
<p>But it turns out that these elevations</p>
<p>in norepinephrine and dopamine are very long lasting</p>
<p>in ways that people report feeling</p>
<p>vast improvements in mood</p>
<p>and vast improvements in levels of cognitive attention</p>
<p>and energy.</p>
<p>So by my read of the literature,</p>
<p>these seem to be healthy increases</p>
<p>in our baseline levels of these chemicals</p>
<p>in ways that can really support us.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a protocol for that.</p>
<p>Now, those are some of the mental effects</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>but deliberate cold exposure has also been studied</p>
<p>in animal models and in humans</p>
<p>in the context of increasing metabolism,</p>
<p>even in converting certain fat cells</p>
<p>that we call white fat cells,</p>
<p>which are the ones where energy is stored,</p>
<p>the ones that we typically think of as kind of blubbery fat</p>
<p>to beige or brown fat, which is thermogenic fat,</p>
<p>meaning that it can increase core body temperature</p>
<p>and serves as kind of the furnace</p>
<p>by which we increase our core metabolism.</p>
<p>So with a very broad stroke,</p>
<p>I can say that white fat is generally the kind of fat</p>
<p>that people want less of,</p>
<p>and beige fat and brown fat is generally the kind of fat</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re going to have fat cells</p>
<p>and you certainly need fat cells that you want more of,</p>
<p>they are thermogenic, they help you stay lean,</p>
<p>they actually serve as a reservoir for heating your body up</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever confronted with a cold challenge.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about how to use cold</p>
<p>for metabolism as well.</p>
<p>And of course, people are using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to reduce inflammation post-exercise,</p>
<p>to reduce inflammation generally.</p>
<p>And people are also using cold to enhance performance</p>
<p>in the context of strength training,</p>
<p>in the context of endurance training,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about those data as well.</p>
<p>But where I&rsquo;d like to start is with mental performance,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to detail what happens</p>
<p>when we deliberately expose ourselves to cold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s key to point out the word deliberate.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t say otherwise, then throughout this episode,</p>
<p>if I say cold exposure, I mean deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>And the reason I point that out</p>
<p>is that as my colleague David Spiegel</p>
<p>in the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford says,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about the state that we are in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the state that we are in</p>
<p>and whether or not we had anything to do</p>
<p>with placing ourselves into that state</p>
<p>and whether or not we did that on purpose or not.</p>
<p>And what he really means by that statement</p>
<p>is that there are important effects of what we call mindset.</p>
<p>Mindset was a topic discussed in the guest episode</p>
<p>with Ali Crum some weeks ago.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen that episode, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>And the science of mindset tells us</p>
<p>that if we are doing something deliberately</p>
<p>and we believe that it&rsquo;s going to be good for us,</p>
<p>it actually can lead to a different set</p>
<p>of physiological effects</p>
<p>than if something is happening to us</p>
<p>against our will or without our control.</p>
<p>Now, this is different than placebo effects.</p>
<p>Placebo effects are distinct from mindset effects.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the distinction,</p>
<p>please see the episode with Ali Crum.</p>
<p>But again, when I talk about cold exposure in this episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>meaning that you are placing yourself</p>
<p>into a cold environment on purpose</p>
<p>in order to extract a particular set of benefits.</p>
<p>When we talk about deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>almost always that means getting uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And one of the most common questions I get</p>
<p>when discussing the use of cold</p>
<p>for sake of mental or physical performance,</p>
<p>metabolism, et cetera, is how cold should it be?</p>
<p>How cold should the water be?</p>
<p>How cold should the environment be?</p>
<p>And I just will tell you now,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to say this again and again</p>
<p>throughout the episode</p>
<p>because it will continue to be true throughout the episode</p>
<p>and long after the episode is over,</p>
<p>how cold depends on your cold tolerance,</p>
<p>your core metabolism, and a number of other features</p>
<p>that there is simply no way I could know or have access to.</p>
<p>So I would like you to use this rule of thumb.</p>
<p>If you are using deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>the environment that you place yourself into</p>
<p>should place your mind into a state of,</p>
<p>whoa, I would really like to get out of this environment,</p>
<p>but I can stay in safely.</p>
<p>Okay, now that might seem a little bit arbitrary,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you were to get into a warm shower</p>
<p>and it would feel really, really nice.</p>
<p>And you were to start turning down the warm</p>
<p>and turning up the cold.</p>
<p>There would be some threshold</p>
<p>at which it would feel uncomfortable to you.</p>
<p>And if you were to continue</p>
<p>to make a little bit colder than that,</p>
<p>you would really want to get out of the shower,</p>
<p>but you were confident that you could stay in</p>
<p>without risking your health, right?</p>
<p>Without risking a heart attack.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s very different than jumping</p>
<p>into a very, very cold lake,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve seen these images of people that will cut holes</p>
<p>into frozen over lakes,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get into that cold water.</p>
<p>If you are trained to do that</p>
<p>and you have the right conditions, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can be done reasonably safely,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s certainly not what I would start with.</p>
<p>And for many people that will be too cold.</p>
<p>And indeed some people can go into cold shock</p>
<p>and can die as a consequence of getting</p>
<p>to that extremely cold water very quickly.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not to scare you away</p>
<p>from deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to say that there&rsquo;s no simple prescriptive</p>
<p>of how cold to make the environment</p>
<p>in order to extract maximum benefit</p>
<p>for mental or physical performance.</p>
<p>So the simple rule of thumb is going to be,</p>
<p>place yourself into an environment</p>
<p>that is uncomfortably cold,</p>
<p>but that you can stay in safely.</p>
<p>Okay, and you&rsquo;ll have to experiment a bit.</p>
<p>And that number,</p>
<p>meaning that temperature will vary from day to day.</p>
<p>It will vary across the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>because of that endogenous,</p>
<p>meaning that internal rhythm in temperature</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Low early in the day rises</p>
<p>into the afternoon drops at night.</p>
<p>You can actually do this experiment if you like.</p>
<p>Try getting into a cold shower at 11 o&rsquo;clock at night,</p>
<p>if you want, versus try doing it</p>
<p>in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite a different experience.</p>
<p>And by quite a different experience,</p>
<p>I mean, it requires quite a different degree</p>
<p>of resilience and leaning into the practice.</p>
<p>Your willpower will have to be higher, I suspect,</p>
<p>late in the day as compared to early in the day.</p>
<p>But that will vary, of course,</p>
<p>between individuals as well.</p>
<p>So the most common question I get</p>
<p>about deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>is how cold should the water be?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve answered that with uncomfortably cold</p>
<p>to the point where you want to get out,</p>
<p>but you can safely stay in.</p>
<p>The second most common question I get</p>
<p>about deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>is whether or not cold showers are as good,</p>
<p>better, or worse than cold water immersion</p>
<p>up to the neck, for instance.</p>
<p>I also get a lot of questions</p>
<p>about whether or not cryo chambers</p>
<p>are better than all the others, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make all of that very simple</p>
<p>for you by saying cold water immersion</p>
<p>up to the neck with your feet and hands submerged</p>
<p>also is going to be the most effective.</p>
<p>Second best would be cold shower.</p>
<p>Third best would be to go outside</p>
<p>with a minimum amount of clothing,</p>
<p>but of course, clothing that is culturally appropriate</p>
<p>and that would allow you to experience cold</p>
<p>to the point where you would almost want to shiver</p>
<p>or start shivering.</p>
<p>Now, there are a number of different important constraints</p>
<p>that are going to dictate whether or not</p>
<p>you use one form of cold exposure or the other.</p>
<p>For instance, some people don&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to cold water immersion.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have access to ice baths or cold water tanks,</p>
<p>cold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera.</p>
<p>In that case, showers would be the next best solution.</p>
<p>I do want to emphasize that there have been very few,</p>
<p>if any, studies of cold showers.</p>
<p>And you can imagine why this would be the case.</p>
<p>In a laboratory, you want to control</p>
<p>for as many variables as possible.</p>
<p>So placing people into a cold water immersion</p>
<p>or an ice bath up to the neck</p>
<p>and insisting that they keep their hands and feet under</p>
<p>is very easy to control.</p>
<p>It means that everyone can do essentially the same thing,</p>
<p>whereas with cold showers,</p>
<p>people are different sized bodies.</p>
<p>Some people are going to put their head under.</p>
<p>Some people are going to lean forward.</p>
<p>Measuring the amount of cold water exposure on the body</p>
<p>is very hard to do.</p>
<p>And so there aren&rsquo;t a lot of studies of cold showers,</p>
<p>but of course, a lot of people don&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to cold water immersion, so they have to use cold showers.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have access to both, of course,</p>
<p>then going outside on a cold day can be of benefit.</p>
<p>But I will point out that the heat transfer</p>
<p>from your body into water is much higher,</p>
<p>four times greater, if not even greater,</p>
<p>depending on the temperature of the water,</p>
<p>in water as opposed to in air.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be much more efficient</p>
<p>to do cold water immersion than anything else.</p>
<p>Cold showers after that,</p>
<p>and put yourself into a cold environment</p>
<p>would be the third best thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into cryo chambers</p>
<p>because they carry quite a high degree of cost.</p>
<p>And again, there aren&rsquo;t many studies of them.</p>
<p>So if you have access to cryo chambers,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the cryo chamber facility</p>
<p>has told you about all these incredible benefits.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t doubt that some of those benefits truly exist,</p>
<p>but most people just don&rsquo;t have the resources</p>
<p>or the access to those.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to leave cryo chambers</p>
<p>out of today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>And of course, I realized there&rsquo;s a fourth category</p>
<p>of cold exposure out there.</p>
<p>People who are wearing ice vests,</p>
<p>believe it or not, those exist.</p>
<p>Ice underwear, yes, those exist.</p>
<p>You can look for them on Amazon if you like.</p>
<p>They are putting cold packs in their armpits</p>
<p>or in their groin or elsewhere</p>
<p>in order to stimulate some of the effects of cold</p>
<p>on mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to address those in too much detail today.</p>
<p>They can be efficient in certain ways,</p>
<p>but as you&rsquo;ll learn about later in the episode,</p>
<p>cooling the palms, the upper face,</p>
<p>and the bottoms of the feet</p>
<p>is going to be far more efficient.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, I think most of the people</p>
<p>that are using ice packs to increase their core metabolism</p>
<p>are not aware of the glabber skin cooling</p>
<p>and how it can be a very, very potent stimulus.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll return to that later.</p>
<p>Unless I say otherwise,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mainly going to be focusing on cold water immersion</p>
<p>and cold showers.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about protocols</p>
<p>for enhancing mental health and performance</p>
<p>using deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>What happens when we get into cold</p>
<p>is that we experience an increase in norepinephrine,</p>
<p>in noradrenaline release and in adrenaline release.</p>
<p>The fact that cold exposure, deliberate or no,</p>
<p>increases norepinephrine and epinephrine</p>
<p>in our brain and body</p>
<p>means that it is a very reliable stimulus</p>
<p>for increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of an obvious statement,</p>
<p>but that obvious statement can be leveraged</p>
<p>to systematically build up what we call resilience.</p>
<p>Now, when we experience a stressor in life,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s something bad happens</p>
<p>in our relationship or something bad happens in the world</p>
<p>and we feel stress,</p>
<p>that stress is the consequence of increases</p>
<p>in norepinephrine and epinephrine in our brain and body.</p>
<p>Very similar, if not identical,</p>
<p>to the kinds of increases</p>
<p>that come from deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So deliberate cold exposure is an opportunity</p>
<p>to deliberately stress our body.</p>
<p>And yet, because it&rsquo;s deliberate</p>
<p>and because we can take certain steps,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll describe in a moment,</p>
<p>we can learn to maintain mental clarity.</p>
<p>We can learn to maintain calm</p>
<p>while our body is in a state of stress.</p>
<p>And that can be immensely useful</p>
<p>when encountering stressors in other parts of life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we call resilience or grit,</p>
<p>our ability or mental toughness,</p>
<p>our ability to lean into challenge</p>
<p>or to tolerate challenge</p>
<p>while keeping our heads straight, so to speak.</p>
<p>So one simple protocol for increasing resilience</p>
<p>is to pick a temperature that&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>of shower or cold immersion,</p>
<p>and then to get in for a certain duration of time,</p>
<p>and then to get out.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that people will experience different levels</p>
<p>of norepinephrine and adrenaline release</p>
<p>when getting into cold water.</p>
<p>Some people, because they dread the cold so much,</p>
<p>will actually experience norepinephrine</p>
<p>and epinephrine increases</p>
<p>even before they get into the cold water</p>
<p>or under the cold shower.</p>
<p>Now, you may have experienced this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dreading it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>And I have to force myself to do it.</p>
<p>And indeed, epinephrine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>and its surges can be thought of as sort of walls</p>
<p>that we have to confront and go over.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like you to conceptualize them that way</p>
<p>because it allows us to build protocols</p>
<p>that can be very objective</p>
<p>and can allow us to monitor our progress</p>
<p>in terms of building resilience.</p>
<p>So one option is to simply say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m going to force myself</p>
<p>to get into the cold shower for one minute.</p>
<p>How cold?</p>
<p>Again, uncomfortably cold,</p>
<p>but you can stay in safely.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m going to get into the ice bath</p>
<p>for one minute.</p>
<p>Ice baths are very cold, inevitably.</p>
<p>And what is also inevitable</p>
<p>is that when you get into the cold,</p>
<p>you will experience a surge</p>
<p>in epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s non-negotiable</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s mediated by cold receptors</p>
<p>on the surface of your body and your skin.</p>
<p>And the way that they trigger the release</p>
<p>of norepinephrine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>not just from the adrenals,</p>
<p>from the adrenal glands above your kidneys,</p>
<p>but also from regions of your brain,</p>
<p>like the locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>which cause increases in attention and alertness,</p>
<p>and from other locations in your body</p>
<p>where epinephrine and norepinephrine are released.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>cold is a non-negotiable stimulus</p>
<p>for increasing epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Even if you are the toughest person in the world</p>
<p>and you love the cold,</p>
<p>that increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>is going to happen.</p>
<p>So the way to think about norepinephrine and epinephrine</p>
<p>in this context of building mental resilience</p>
<p>is that you have two options.</p>
<p>You can either try to extend the duration</p>
<p>of time that you are in the deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So going from one minute to 75 seconds,</p>
<p>to two minutes and so on over a period of days.</p>
<p>Or one way to approach this,</p>
<p>and the way that I particularly favor,</p>
<p>is to take the context of the day and the moment</p>
<p>into account.</p>
<p>Meaning we have different levels of grit and resilience</p>
<p>on different days,</p>
<p>and depending on the landscape of our life</p>
<p>at the time,</p>
<p>even the time of day that we&rsquo;re doing these protocols,</p>
<p>and start to be able to sense</p>
<p>the release of epinephrine, excuse me,</p>
<p>and norepinephrine in our brain and body,</p>
<p>and see those as walls that we want to climb over</p>
<p>in order to build resilience,</p>
<p>and to start counting the number of walls that we traverse</p>
<p>and the distance between those walls</p>
<p>as we do deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of the timed protocol</p>
<p>because that one is very straightforward,</p>
<p>although I do not think it is as powerful</p>
<p>for building mental resilience.</p>
<p>The time protocol would be Monday,</p>
<p>I do one minute of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>at a given temperature.</p>
<p>Wednesday, I extend that by 50%.</p>
<p>And Friday, I do deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for twice as long as I did on Monday.</p>
<p>And if I were to continue that every week,</p>
<p>Monday, Wednesday, Friday,</p>
<p>I would continue to either increase the duration,</p>
<p>or I would lower the temperature and reduce the duration.</p>
<p>This kind of thing, very much like sets and reps in the gym.</p>
<p>Now that option is very objective, right?</p>
<p>You could even log it in a book.</p>
<p>And as you develop the ability to stay in cold temperatures,</p>
<p>even progressively colder and colder temperatures</p>
<p>for longer and longer periods of time,</p>
<p>you will become more resilient.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, my operational definition of resilience</p>
<p>is that you are able to resist escape from the stressor,</p>
<p>the cold, by virtue of your willpower,</p>
<p>which is really your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>causing top-down control on your reflexes</p>
<p>and your limbic system and your hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which are basically telling you</p>
<p>to get out of that cold water,</p>
<p>get out of that cold environment.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>you are basically getting better at controlling your behavior</p>
<p>when your brain and body are flooded</p>
<p>with norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very reductionist way to explain resilience</p>
<p>or greater mental toughness,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a reductionist way of explaining it</p>
<p>that is very closely tied to the biology</p>
<p>and to the psychology.</p>
<p>And it is a fact that norepinephrine and epinephrine release</p>
<p>in the brain and body</p>
<p>are the generic universal code for stressor.</p>
<p>There is no unique chemical signature</p>
<p>for different forms of stressors.</p>
<p>That is the only one.</p>
<p>Although, of course,</p>
<p>there are other chemicals involved as well.</p>
<p>So you could go for time</p>
<p>and you could try and reduce the temperature</p>
<p>and increase the time over a period of days or weeks.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s an attractive way to approach things,</p>
<p>but the problem is</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have an infinite amount of room</p>
<p>with which to lower temperature</p>
<p>because eventually you will get into temperatures</p>
<p>that are either so cold that they are dangerous</p>
<p>or you have to stay in cold temperatures</p>
<p>for such long periods that it becomes impractical</p>
<p>because presumably you also have to take care</p>
<p>of other aspects of your life.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just sit all day in the ice bath.</p>
<p>Now, for that reason,</p>
<p>I favor a protocol in which you build mental resilience</p>
<p>and mental toughness</p>
<p>through two different types of protocols.</p>
<p>The first one involves counting walls.</p>
<p>Now, what do I mean by walls?</p>
<p>I mean, the sensation of, no, I don&rsquo;t want to do this,</p>
<p>and the idea or the sensation in your brain and body</p>
<p>that you actually want to leave that environment</p>
<p>and go warm up.</p>
<p>Now, again, for some people,</p>
<p>that will be even before getting</p>
<p>into the ice bath or cold shower.</p>
<p>So if you are feeling very resistant</p>
<p>to getting into the ice bath or cold shower</p>
<p>and you manage to do that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going over what I would call one wall, okay?</p>
<p>Then for some period of time,</p>
<p>you might actually feel comfortable</p>
<p>in the ice bath, cold water, or cold shower,</p>
<p>and you feel like you could stay there</p>
<p>for some period of time,</p>
<p>that you could stay there for a minute or two minutes,</p>
<p>but inevitably the next wall will arrive.</p>
<p>And I would encourage you to pay attention</p>
<p>to when that next wall arrives</p>
<p>and actually having an awareness,</p>
<p>that so-called interoceptive awareness, as we call it,</p>
<p>of when that next surge in adrenaline epinephrine comes</p>
<p>or whether or not it reaches a certain threshold</p>
<p>in your brain and body that you feel you want to get out,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to stay in for even just 10 seconds longer,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;ve traversed yet another wall.</p>
<p>And if you continue to stay in that cold environment,</p>
<p>you will find that the next wall will come</p>
<p>and the next wall will come.</p>
<p>Now, eventually, of course, you will get very, very numb,</p>
<p>depending on how cold it is,</p>
<p>and you could also place yourself into danger.</p>
<p>So you have to maintain cognitive control,</p>
<p>counting these walls, traversing these walls,</p>
<p>but getting out at some point, of course.</p>
<p>So my favorite protocol for building mental toughness,</p>
<p>aka grit, aka resilience,</p>
<p>is to take into account that some days</p>
<p>just getting into the ice bath or cold shower</p>
<p>represents a wall, some days it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some days you get in</p>
<p>and you feel like you could go 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Other days you get in</p>
<p>and you feel like you could only go a minute.</p>
<p>And setting a designated number of walls</p>
<p>before you start the protocol</p>
<p>is going to be very beneficial here.</p>
<p>So you say, as long as I can do it safely,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do three walls today.</p>
<p>The first wall is getting in,</p>
<p>the second wall will arrive when it arrives,</p>
<p>and the third wall will arrive when it arrives,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get over that wall and then I&rsquo;ll get out.</p>
<p>The next day, you might do five walls.</p>
<p>The next day, you might do three walls again,</p>
<p>but you might lower the temperature.</p>
<p>This gives you tremendous flexibility,</p>
<p>and indeed, it gives you much more latitude</p>
<p>to be able to use the same temperatures in different ways,</p>
<p>or to reduce the temperature only a little bit</p>
<p>and still get a lot of stimulus,</p>
<p>meaning a lot of results out of a given protocol.</p>
<p>Whereas people who are just going for temperature and time</p>
<p>eventually become cold adapted.</p>
<p>They get very, very good at doing three minutes</p>
<p>or six minutes or even 10 minutes at a given temperature.</p>
<p>And so then they feel like they have to lower</p>
<p>the temperature even more and even more,</p>
<p>and eventually they just bottom out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to get improvements out of the protocol,</p>
<p>at least not in terms of mental resilience.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s still the positive effects</p>
<p>on inflammation and metabolism, et cetera,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a little bit.</p>
<p>But the key thing here is to design protocols</p>
<p>that are going to work for you over time.</p>
<p>And for you very, very hardy,</p>
<p>very, very tough guys and gals out there</p>
<p>that can get right into an ice bath</p>
<p>or a very, very cold immersion,</p>
<p>and you can just grind it out for six or 10 minutes,</p>
<p>or you can even do that by remaining peaceful.</p>
<p>Well, more points to you, but guess what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the equivalent of already having loaded up</p>
<p>the barbell with 600 pounds and done your 10 reps.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a whole lot more variable space</p>
<p>with which to get benefits from that stimulus.</p>
<p>And in the weight room, people understand</p>
<p>that you can adjust, for instance,</p>
<p>the speed of the movement,</p>
<p>or you can start combining that movement</p>
<p>with pre-exhaustion, et cetera.</p>
<p>With cold exposure,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have as much variable space to play with.</p>
<p>So if your goal is to build resilience,</p>
<p>either go for time as a function of temperature,</p>
<p>or what I suggest is to start recognizing these walls</p>
<p>as an experience of resistance in you</p>
<p>and going over those walls,</p>
<p>set a certain number of walls</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to go over on a given day</p>
<p>and do that at a given temperature,</p>
<p>and then to mix it up.</p>
<p>And ideally, you might even throw in one more wall</p>
<p>at the end if you&rsquo;re really feeling bold and brave,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to build out further resilience.</p>
<p>But if you want cold exposure to work for you</p>
<p>for sake of building up resilience</p>
<p>and mental toughness over time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to vary this parameter space</p>
<p>in some sort of way.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to be super systematic about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of this kind of approach,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re relying on the fact</p>
<p>that those walls really represent times</p>
<p>in which you are forcing your top-down control,</p>
<p>your prefrontal cortex, to clamp down on your reflex,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re learning behavioral control</p>
<p>in the context of your body having elevated levels</p>
<p>of these catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>And that translates to real life</p>
<p>in a much more realistic way, I believe,</p>
<p>because in real life, you&rsquo;re not really engaging</p>
<p>in stressors for a given amount of time</p>
<p>that you know how long it&rsquo;s going to last</p>
<p>and you know the context.</p>
<p>No, most stressors arrive in the form</p>
<p>of surprises we don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>text messages that deliver bad news,</p>
<p>information about the outside world or real world</p>
<p>and online interactions that send our system</p>
<p>into a state of increased norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>And if you start to think of those as walls</p>
<p>that you can tolerate and climb over</p>
<p>while staying calm and clear of mind,</p>
<p>then you can really imagine how the ice bath</p>
<p>and other forms of cold exposure are really serving</p>
<p>to train you up for real life stressors.</p>
<p>Okay, the next question that I always get</p>
<p>is what should my mental state be</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m exposing myself to this uncomfortable</p>
<p>yet safe condition of cold?</p>
<p>Well, you have two options</p>
<p>and there are probably other options as well.</p>
<p>One is to try and calm yourself</p>
<p>to remain as mentally still as possible.</p>
<p>The other is to lean into that challenge</p>
<p>and so to grind it out.</p>
<p>And here, I have to say that this is a lot</p>
<p>like teaching someone to drive on a gravel road.</p>
<p>For any of you that have driven on a gravel road,</p>
<p>you know that there is no optimal speed</p>
<p>for all gravel roads.</p>
<p>It depends on the density of the gravel, et cetera,</p>
<p>and the vehicle, et cetera.</p>
<p>So for instance, on some gravel roads,</p>
<p>when you start to drive and the dust starts to kick up,</p>
<p>your best option is to drive fast</p>
<p>and put that dust cloud behind you.</p>
<p>On other gravel roads, if you try and do that,</p>
<p>the dust actually kicks up around the vehicle</p>
<p>and it makes it hard to see.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to slow down.</p>
<p>The same thing is true</p>
<p>for getting through deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to calm yourself.</p>
<p>One way to do that is through double inhales</p>
<p>through the nose and extended exhales through the mouth</p>
<p>or simply by trying to control your breathing</p>
<p>and reduce the pace of your breathing</p>
<p>and increase the volume of your breathing.</p>
<p>I have to say that everyone experiences</p>
<p>a shortening of breath</p>
<p>when they get into uncomfortably cold water.</p>
<p>That is a universal physiological response.</p>
<p>Everyone also experiences a 30 to 80% decrease</p>
<p>in cognitive function, in particular of the frontal cortex.</p>
<p>The metabolism of your frontal cortex goes down.</p>
<p>The metabolism, meaning the activity of brain areas</p>
<p>associated with stress and panic goes way up.</p>
<p>And so anchoring your mind in cognitive activities</p>
<p>as you get into the cold can be very, very helpful</p>
<p>for maintaining clarity of mind.</p>
<p>In fact, one thing that I sometimes recommend</p>
<p>is that people try and engage</p>
<p>in some sort of cognitive exercise while in the cold,</p>
<p>not as a form of distraction,</p>
<p>but as a way to maintain clarity of thinking</p>
<p>and to learn how to do that when the body is flooded</p>
<p>with all these chemicals that make us stressed.</p>
<p>So for instance, you could do math problems</p>
<p>and not two plus two equals four,</p>
<p>not three times three equals nine,</p>
<p>but things that require a little bit more focus</p>
<p>and attention, working memory and so forth.</p>
<p>You could also start to have thoughts</p>
<p>that you deliberately impose a full sentence structure on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually quite tough.</p>
<p>You could try and recall specific bouts of information</p>
<p>that are challenging.</p>
<p>This is teaching your mind how to stay online,</p>
<p>or rather I should say,</p>
<p>this is you teaching your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>how to stay engaged while you have high levels of stress</p>
<p>in your body.</p>
<p>Years ago, I had a friend who works</p>
<p>in the neuroscience world, research neuroscientists,</p>
<p>who was obsessed with this very bizarre sport</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend at all,</p>
<p>which is the combination of boxing and chess.</p>
<p>You may have seen this on YouTube</p>
<p>where people will box around, legitimate boxing around,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sparring all out often.</p>
<p>And then at the end of the round,</p>
<p>instead of resting in the corner,</p>
<p>they actually sit down and play chess.</p>
<p>And then they go back to boxing and back to chess.</p>
<p>Again, not a sport that I recommend,</p>
<p>but the reason he was obsessed with this</p>
<p>is because he studies the impact of stress</p>
<p>on cognitive performance.</p>
<p>And what that particular very bizarre sport was doing</p>
<p>was toggling back and forth</p>
<p>between different states of mind.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s used both to increase cognitive clarity</p>
<p>for the fighter when they box,</p>
<p>because staying calm and clear thinking</p>
<p>is very important to winning boxing matches.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it&rsquo;s not an all outrage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very calculated game of mental chess</p>
<p>and physical chess that&rsquo;s quite high stakes,</p>
<p>as you can imagine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also used in some circles as a way to teach people</p>
<p>how to engage in cognitive performance</p>
<p>when their body is simply filled with stress.</p>
<p>So in the boxing chess example,</p>
<p>the replacement for the cold water</p>
<p>is actually the boxing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s supposed to induce the stress</p>
<p>because getting hit is stressful</p>
<p>and the risk of getting hit is stressful for most people.</p>
<p>So again, if you think about deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>as a way of just systematically</p>
<p>and reliably inducing epinephrine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine release and delivering stress,</p>
<p>well then this idea of maintaining cognitive clarity</p>
<p>and actually engaging in cognitive tasks</p>
<p>while in the ice bath or cold shower</p>
<p>can actually be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Even though it might sound a little bit silly,</p>
<p>you are really training up your ability</p>
<p>to keep your brain working when the reflex</p>
<p>is to shut down the parts of your brain</p>
<p>that are involved in deliberate planning and thinking.</p>
<p>Now, another important aspect of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>that I rarely, if ever here discussed,</p>
<p>but is vitally important</p>
<p>is whether or not you move around or not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the reason.</p>
<p>When you get into cold water</p>
<p>and you remain there for some period of time,</p>
<p>your body is generating heat</p>
<p>and that heat generates what&rsquo;s called a thermal layer</p>
<p>that surrounds your entire body.</p>
<p>So if you stay still,</p>
<p>you are actually warmer than if you move around.</p>
<p>You can try this the next time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing your deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re submerged up to the neck,</p>
<p>sit there for about 10, 30 seconds</p>
<p>and be very, very still of body.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the way that most people</p>
<p>start to do deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>They give this very stoic look.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t blink.</p>
<p>They look very peaceful.</p>
<p>Some of them even look tough,</p>
<p>or they make a very even, a-emotional face.</p>
<p>And so it looks like they&rsquo;re really tough,</p>
<p>but they are so still that believe it or not,</p>
<p>they are not providing the most potent stimulus.</p>
<p>If they or you were to move around in that water,</p>
<p>what would happen is you&rsquo;d break up the thermal layer</p>
<p>and that you actually experienced that as much colder.</p>
<p>So if you really want to push the resilience aspect,</p>
<p>or for instance,</p>
<p>if you want to use a given temperature</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re comfortable in,</p>
<p>but that you want to increase the stimulus</p>
<p>and you want to get some more benefit</p>
<p>for mental resilience training,</p>
<p>well then get into the cold water,</p>
<p>move your body around continuously,</p>
<p>but try and keep your mind still</p>
<p>or even do some sort of cognitive task.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re starting to realize,</p>
<p>there are a bunch of different variables</p>
<p>that you can play with</p>
<p>while maintaining the same temperature of water.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>really keep you in the zone of what should</p>
<p>and absolutely has to be safe for you</p>
<p>without having to just continually drop the temperature</p>
<p>from say 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33,</p>
<p>because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;re going to bottom out.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re one of those people that likes to look tough</p>
<p>or really relaxed while you&rsquo;re in the ice bath</p>
<p>or cold water immersion,</p>
<p>just realize that you&rsquo;re actually cheating yourself</p>
<p>out of part of the stimulus.</p>
<p>Keep those limbs moving</p>
<p>and of course limbs under the water,</p>
<p>feet and hands is going to be a more potent stimulus</p>
<p>than hands and feet out</p>
<p>for reasons that should be obvious</p>
<p>based on what we talked about</p>
<p>in terms of glab or skin cooling.</p>
<p>So keep those submerged,</p>
<p>move your body, pedal,</p>
<p>maybe move your knees up and down, pedal your feet.</p>
<p>And trust me, it&rsquo;s going to feel a lot colder</p>
<p>than were you to remain stone still.</p>
<p>Another very common question is how often</p>
<p>to do deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to make a recommendation on that</p>
<p>based on any peer reviewed study.</p>
<p>Although there are a few in humans</p>
<p>that point to a threshold of 11 minutes total per week.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s total throughout the week</p>
<p>divided into two or four sessions</p>
<p>of two or three minutes or so.</p>
<p>Now that 11 minute cutoff is not a strict threshold</p>
<p>and is actually geared more towards increases in metabolism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into this a little bit later in the episode,</p>
<p>but I think the 11 minute threshold,</p>
<p>meaning 11 minutes total of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>per week is a pretty good number to use</p>
<p>if you need a number in order to keep you consistent.</p>
<p>But as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>some of you are going to be in the ice bath</p>
<p>or cold immersion or cold shower for one minute.</p>
<p>Others of you will be in there for 10 minutes,</p>
<p>depending on how frequent and how high, if you will,</p>
<p>those walls of adrenaline are coming.</p>
<p>So for some of you getting into a cold shower</p>
<p>for three minutes total for the whole week</p>
<p>will represent a tremendous achievement</p>
<p>in terms of willpower and overcoming the resistance</p>
<p>to doing that, overcoming those walls.</p>
<p>For others of you, three minutes is nothing.</p>
<p>So what do I recommend?</p>
<p>I recommend that you get at least 11 minutes total per week,</p>
<p>but at the point where 11 minutes total per week</p>
<p>is very easy for you</p>
<p>or is no longer representing a significant mental challenge,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re not experiencing many of these walls,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re excited to get into the cold shower or immersion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through it easily, you&rsquo;re cruising basically.</p>
<p>Then I would say either lower the temperature safely,</p>
<p>of course, extend the duration safely, of course,</p>
<p>or increase the frequency</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re doing this perhaps every day</p>
<p>or maybe five days a week or three days a week.</p>
<p>I personally get tremendous benefit</p>
<p>from doing deliberate cold exposure three times a week</p>
<p>and using the walls method that I described earlier</p>
<p>as my gauge for how long to stay in.</p>
<p>And typically that means that I&rsquo;m staying in</p>
<p>for anywhere from two minutes to six minutes per session.</p>
<p>And that averages out to about 11</p>
<p>to 15 minutes total per week.</p>
<p>So again, I do not think that you need to be super strict</p>
<p>about these guidelines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s most important when embracing a protocol,</p>
<p>A, that you do it safely,</p>
<p>but secondarily that you do it consistently.</p>
<p>So find what you can do consistently</p>
<p>and then vary the parameters that will allow you</p>
<p>to continue to do deliberate cold exposure consistently,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you have access to a shower</p>
<p>or a cold immersion, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve been talking about mental effects</p>
<p>and the use of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for sake of building resilience,</p>
<p>which I do believe can be tremendously powerful.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s no coincidence that the screening</p>
<p>and the training for Navy SEALs</p>
<p>involves a lot of exposure to cold water.</p>
<p>One could argue that it is deliberate</p>
<p>because they elect to go to BUDS,</p>
<p>but when they get into the cold water</p>
<p>at BUDS is dictated by the instructors.</p>
<p>And the reason they use cold water exposure as the stressor</p>
<p>is that it does offer considerable leeway</p>
<p>in terms of duration and temperature,</p>
<p>in terms of how you can use it as a stressor.</p>
<p>Whereas things like heat don&rsquo;t offer much variable space,</p>
<p>as we say, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of room</p>
<p>beyond which you start injuring</p>
<p>or even killing people by using heat.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of forms of stressors out there,</p>
<p>but cold is one that we can titrate,</p>
<p>that we can adjust in ways</p>
<p>that can allow us to continually build up</p>
<p>and or maintain mental toughness.</p>
<p>Now, deliberate cold exposure also has many effects</p>
<p>on chemicals other than norepinephrine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>most notably the neuromodulator dopamine,</p>
<p>which is involved in elevating our mood,</p>
<p>making us feel energized and enhancing our ability to focus.</p>
<p>And that has a lot to do with how dopamine engages us</p>
<p>in motivated states,</p>
<p>tends to narrow our thinking and our behavior</p>
<p>into a particular trench of goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about dopamine,</p>
<p>you can learn a lot about dopamine</p>
<p>in our episode about dopamine, it&rsquo;s at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>You can find it, it&rsquo;s a two and a half hour</p>
<p>plus kind of deep dive into all things dopamine,</p>
<p>focus, motivation, et cetera.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure has a very powerful effect</p>
<p>on the release of dopamine in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And this is one of the main reasons</p>
<p>why people continue to do deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Basically, it makes us feel good</p>
<p>and it continues to make us feel good</p>
<p>even after we get out of the cold environment.</p>
<p>In fact, some people would say</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel good in the cold environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all stress for them, but afterwards they feel great.</p>
<p>One of our previous guests, Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a medical doctor</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a close colleague of mine,</p>
<p>described the use of dopamine in her book,</p>
<p>Dopamine Nation, an incredible book</p>
<p>about addiction and dopamine, I should mention.</p>
<p>And the use of dopamine elicited by cold water exposure</p>
<p>by one of her patients.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to is the fact that one of her patients</p>
<p>helped themselves get and stay sober off drugs</p>
<p>by using deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>So a healthier form of dopamine release</p>
<p>than they were engaged in prior to getting sober.</p>
<p>Now, the basis for dopamine release</p>
<p>in response to cold exposure</p>
<p>is that the catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and dopamine tend to be co-released</p>
<p>by the same sorts of stimuli.</p>
<p>But most stressors, and in particular things</p>
<p>that evoke stress or our feelings of stress internally</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t like, do not increase dopamine.</p>
<p>They only increase norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>But deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>seems to cause a dramatic increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>And this has actually been substantiated</p>
<p>in a really beautiful study</p>
<p>entitled Human Physiological Responses</p>
<p>to Immersion into Water of Different Temperatures.</p>
<p>The first author is Sramek.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost certainly pronouncing that poorly,</p>
<p>if and if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K.</p>
<p>This was published in the European Journal</p>
<p>of Applied Physiology in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Really a beautiful study.</p>
<p>I love this study.</p>
<p>They took people and they had them sit in chairs</p>
<p>underwater, but their head was out</p>
<p>and so they were immersed up to the neck</p>
<p>in either of three different temperatures, excuse me,</p>
<p>32 degrees Celsius, which is 89 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>20 degrees Celsius, which is 68 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>or 14 degrees Celsius, which is 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>So not super cold.</p>
<p>But then what they did is they measured</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s core body temperature throughout.</p>
<p>They measured their metabolism</p>
<p>and they looked at serum levels of things</p>
<p>like norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol,</p>
<p>serum meaning within the blood.</p>
<p>So a really nice and quite thorough study.</p>
<p>There were not a huge number of subjects in the study,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, it was a very thorough study</p>
<p>in terms of the number of variables that they explored.</p>
<p>So I just want to briefly highlight some of what they saw</p>
<p>or what they observed in this study.</p>
<p>First of all, all the groups were in the water</p>
<p>of a given temperature for one hour,</p>
<p>which is much longer than most</p>
<p>of the deliberate cold exposure protocols</p>
<p>that anyone is using at home.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you&rsquo;re taking one hour long cold showers.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re getting into the ice bath for an hour,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t recommend that.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d probably get badly hypothermic,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re getting into a cold water immersion</p>
<p>for some period of time,</p>
<p>but I have a hard time imagining that it would be an hour</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t suggest that if it&rsquo;s very cold.</p>
<p>So this study focused</p>
<p>on actually somewhat moderately cool temperatures,</p>
<p>not what I think most people would consider</p>
<p>very, very cold temperatures,</p>
<p>but extended the duration for quite a while.</p>
<p>So again, 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>or 14 degrees Celsius, here&rsquo;s what they observed.</p>
<p>The group that was immersed up to the neck</p>
<p>in 32 degrees Celsius, that is 89 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>water did not experience a shift in metabolism</p>
<p>nor a significant increase in dopamine nor epinephrine</p>
<p>or these other catecholamines.</p>
<p>The group that was in 20 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit water for an hour,</p>
<p>experienced a 93% increase in metabolic rate,</p>
<p>which is remarkable given that the water wasn&rsquo;t that cold,</p>
<p>and yet an hour is a pretty long time to be in there.</p>
<p>And again, it speaks to the dramatic effect</p>
<p>of heat transfer that water has,</p>
<p>which I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>as opposed to being out in the air at 68 degrees,</p>
<p>it would certainly not cause that increase</p>
<p>in metabolic rate.</p>
<p>The group that was at 14 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit water for an hour,</p>
<p>experienced a 350% increase in metabolism.</p>
<p>So huge increases in metabolism.</p>
<p>Now, the most interesting data to me,</p>
<p>at least in terms of mental effects</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>were that the plasma or serum levels</p>
<p>of norepinephrine in the blood increased 530%.</p>
<p>These are huge increases in norepinephrine.</p>
<p>So it suggests that this is a stressful stimulus,</p>
<p>at least neurochemically speaking, stressful,</p>
<p>despite the fact that it&rsquo;s not super, super cold.</p>
<p>Although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius</p>
<p>is not a, you know, it&rsquo;s not a warm environment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a ultra, ultra cold environment,</p>
<p>but an hour is a very long time to be in there.</p>
<p>The subjects also experienced a 250% increase</p>
<p>in dopamine concentrations,</p>
<p>which while not 530%, as it was with norepinephrine,</p>
<p>is still a very large increase</p>
<p>in baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>And what was interesting is that those increases</p>
<p>in dopamine persisted for a very long period</p>
<p>of time afterwards, even out to two hours, okay?</p>
<p>And they did, they stopped the study after 120 minutes</p>
<p>of getting out of the cold.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, these increases in norepinephrine</p>
<p>are huge and long lasting.</p>
<p>And these increases in dopamine</p>
<p>are very large and long lasting.</p>
<p>And I do believe that these documented effects</p>
<p>in humans explain much of the enhancement of attention</p>
<p>and of feelings of wellbeing and mood</p>
<p>that people typically experience</p>
<p>after doing deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is that if you were to go back</p>
<p>to the episode that I did on dopamine,</p>
<p>or you were to go back to the episode that I did</p>
<p>with Dr. Anna Lemke on addiction and dopamine,</p>
<p>what you would find is that increases in dopamine</p>
<p>of the sort evoked by deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>are actually very similar to the kinds of increases</p>
<p>in dopamine that are elicited by things like nicotine</p>
<p>or from other behaviors that are known to be addictive</p>
<p>and bad for us because they lead to other effects</p>
<p>on the brain and body that we simply don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>And yet deliberate cold exposure provided it&rsquo;s done safely</p>
<p>can create similar, if not greater increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that are not just fleeting,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t just occur during say the consumption</p>
<p>of some deleterious drug or activity,</p>
<p>but that are very long lasting and that can be leveraged</p>
<p>toward activities other than deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So I want to emphasize this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that people do deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for an hour a day.</p>
<p>And unfortunately there are not many studies</p>
<p>yet exploring how shorter,</p>
<p>colder temperature environment exposure,</p>
<p>say one minute or three minutes or six minutes</p>
<p>at 55 degrees or at 50 degrees,</p>
<p>whether or not that leads to similar, greater</p>
<p>or reduced levels of dopamine in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And yet almost everybody who does deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>will say, yeah, it was stressful.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it, or I eventually grew to like it,</p>
<p>but that I always feel better afterwards.</p>
<p>And then that feeling lasts a very long period of time.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s almost certain that those experiences</p>
<p>that people report relate to these increases in dopamine</p>
<p>and in concert with the increases in norepinephrine</p>
<p>also explain the other effect that&rsquo;s commonly reported,</p>
<p>which is an enhancement in mental acuity</p>
<p>and the ability to focus.</p>
<p>Now here we can extrapolate to the study that I discussed</p>
<p>at the early part of the episode where I was talking</p>
<p>about the use of short 15 minute exercise,</p>
<p>kind of moderate intensity exercise,</p>
<p>and how that was shown to increase levels of energy</p>
<p>and mental acuity in these working memory</p>
<p>visual attention tasks.</p>
<p>And there again, we have to assume somewhat</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t doing neurochemical measurements,</p>
<p>but we can reasonably assume that those improvements</p>
<p>in cognitive performance were due at least in part</p>
<p>to the increase in catecholamines known to accompany</p>
<p>moderate intensity zone to cardio.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re starting to see here is a theme.</p>
<p>The theme is that virtually any stimulus</p>
<p>that delivers more norepinephrine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and dopamine to our system will sharpen our mental acuity</p>
<p>and elevate our mood and will do so for some period of time.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure, it turns out,</p>
<p>is a very potent way to increase these catecholamines,</p>
<p>this category of chemicals, and thereby to improve mood,</p>
<p>mental acuity, and levels of alertness.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll next see, it not only has that effect,</p>
<p>which can be very beneficial for many people</p>
<p>in a bunch of different circumstances,</p>
<p>but it also has the positive effects</p>
<p>that many people seek in terms of metabolism,</p>
<p>in lowering inflammation in the body,</p>
<p>and other physiological effects as well.</p>
<p>And forgive me, I was almost ready to move on</p>
<p>to effects of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>on metabolism and inflammation and so forth,</p>
<p>but I neglected to point out</p>
<p>one of the other very interesting aspects</p>
<p>of the study showing deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can increase norepinephrine and dopamine,</p>
<p>which is that they observed no significant increases</p>
<p>in the stress hormone cortisol.</p>
<p>And that is both surprising, interesting, and important,</p>
<p>because what it means is that the quality of stress</p>
<p>that deliberate cold exposure is creating in the body</p>
<p>is likely to be one of what we call use stress.</p>
<p>Hans Selye, the great physiologist,</p>
<p>won a Nobel prize for distinguishing between distress,</p>
<p>which is stress in the brain and body</p>
<p>that causes the release of things like cortisol</p>
<p>along with the other catecholamines</p>
<p>and that we experience as negative happening to us</p>
<p>and can lead to negative health outcomes.</p>
<p>And he distinguished that from use stress,</p>
<p>which was stress that we now understand</p>
<p>is associated with increases</p>
<p>in things like norepinephrine and dopamine,</p>
<p>but no increases or minimal increases in cortisol,</p>
<p>and that can lead to positive health outcomes.</p>
<p>So it appears that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can create what we call or what Hans Selye called use stress.</p>
<p>In other words, it can create a condition</p>
<p>in the brain and body in which we are stressing ourselves,</p>
<p>we are training up resilience,</p>
<p>and yet we are creating a neurochemical milieu</p>
<p>that actually has many health benefits.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to shift our attention</p>
<p>to the effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to start by detailing a study</p>
<p>that was performed on humans</p>
<p>and published just at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The title of the study</p>
<p>is Altered Brown Fat Thermoregulation</p>
<p>and Enhanced Cold Induced Thermogenesis</p>
<p>in Young Healthy Winter Swimming Men.</p>
<p>And I should point out</p>
<p>that while the study was only performed on male subjects,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason to think that the effects</p>
<p>that they discovered would only pertain to men.</p>
<p>I would hope that they would also do a study on women</p>
<p>at some point in the future,</p>
<p>but the effects that they describe</p>
<p>are very basic core physiological processes.</p>
<p>What they did is they looked at deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>in this group of young men,</p>
<p>and they used that 11 minute threshold per week.</p>
<p>So in other words, they had them get into cold water</p>
<p>for approximately 11 minutes per week.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s 11 minutes total per week.</p>
<p>They divided that into two sessions,</p>
<p>although in speaking with the first author of the study,</p>
<p>Dr. Susanna Soberg,</p>
<p>I learned that it probably is not important</p>
<p>that it be two sessions,</p>
<p>it could be three or even four sessions,</p>
<p>as long as it reaches that 11 minute threshold.</p>
<p>What they discovered was that</p>
<p>by going into these cold environments,</p>
<p>in this case, cold water immersion up to the neck</p>
<p>for 11 minutes total per week,</p>
<p>that these men experienced increases</p>
<p>in so-called brown fat thermogenesis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about what that is in a moment,</p>
<p>and increases in core body temperature</p>
<p>that translate to increases in core body metabolism.</p>
<p>Now, the overall increases in core body metabolism</p>
<p>that they experienced were not extremely large.</p>
<p>They were statistically significant,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t extremely large.</p>
<p>However, the changes in brown fat stores</p>
<p>are perhaps what&rsquo;s most interesting about this study.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>The metabolic increases of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>are both acute, meaning happening in the short term,</p>
<p>when you get into the cold and immediately after,</p>
<p>one does experience an increase in core metabolism.</p>
<p>You burn some calories, in other words.</p>
<p>And while those might not be very significant increases,</p>
<p>or I should say they can be statistically significant,</p>
<p>but they are not enormously large numbers</p>
<p>of calories burned,</p>
<p>the longer lasting effects of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>on metabolism seem to take place by changes that occur</p>
<p>in the types of fat that we store in our body,</p>
<p>and the way that that fat impacts our metabolism</p>
<p>at other times throughout the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>This actually has a somewhat anecdotal basis,</p>
<p>in particular in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak Swedish, nor I speak Danish,</p>
<p>nor do I speak Norwegian, but I do have Danish relatives,</p>
<p>and they were able to help me decipher</p>
<p>a common Swedish saying,</p>
<p>which essentially translates to the fact that</p>
<p>in preparation for the summer, they say,</p>
<p>one should expose themselves to warm environments</p>
<p>so that one is comfortable</p>
<p>in warm environments in the summer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one half of this traditional Swedish</p>
<p>and also Danish saying.</p>
<p>The other half of this traditional Danish-Swedish saying</p>
<p>is that in preparation for winter,</p>
<p>in order to not feel too cold in cold environments,</p>
<p>one should prepare for those in the fall</p>
<p>by not wearing a jacket</p>
<p>and exposing oneself to cold environments.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is just anecdotal cultural lore,</p>
<p>but it actually has a physiological basis,</p>
<p>which is by exposing oneself to cold environments</p>
<p>on a repeated basis in anticipation of exposure</p>
<p>to more extreme cold environments,</p>
<p>one can feel more comfortable</p>
<p>in those extreme cold environments.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what they observed</p>
<p>in this study by Soberg et al.</p>
<p>The men felt more comfortable in extreme cold</p>
<p>if they had trained through deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>which might not seem surprising at all,</p>
<p>but based on what we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes this discomfort</p>
<p>and this experience of norepinephrine release,</p>
<p>at least in the short term,</p>
<p>then you would say, well,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>also make them feel uncomfortable,</p>
<p>like they really want to get out?</p>
<p>Well, that is true at the beginning</p>
<p>of a deliberate cold exposure protocol,</p>
<p>meaning in the first week or in the second week</p>
<p>or the third week.</p>
<p>But what one finds and what you will find</p>
<p>if you do deliberate cold exposure consistently</p>
<p>is that you will then become more comfortable</p>
<p>at cold temperatures</p>
<p>away from the deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So whereas you might have previously been the person</p>
<p>who was always cold in the room with air conditioning</p>
<p>or always seeking a sweater, always wanting to bundle up,</p>
<p>you will be more comfortable in those cold environments.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is well substantiated</p>
<p>from this study and from animal studies,</p>
<p>whereby deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>converts one particular kind of fat cell,</p>
<p>the white fat cell,</p>
<p>which is a very low metabolic output cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a storage site for energy in the body,</p>
<p>fat cells, to a different type of fat cell,</p>
<p>which is the beige fat cell,</p>
<p>called beige because it&rsquo;s actually beige</p>
<p>or slightly brown under the microscope,</p>
<p>or even to brown fat cells,</p>
<p>which are very dark under the microscope</p>
<p>and dark because they contain mitochondria</p>
<p>and are very metabolically and thermogenically active.</p>
<p>In other words, white fat doesn&rsquo;t burn many calories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a storage site.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bank account for energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s filled with lipids and those lipids can be used</p>
<p>if the body needs energy.</p>
<p>And if it goes into a caloric deficit,</p>
<p>beige fat and brown fat acts as sort of a furnace</p>
<p>or the sort of fat that you would find in a candle,</p>
<p>a fuel that can increase core body temperature.</p>
<p>So beige fat and brown fat is very good</p>
<p>at raising our metabolism and helps burn white fat.</p>
<p>Now, of course it does that only in the context</p>
<p>of a caloric deficit,</p>
<p>but it can actually help create that caloric deficit.</p>
<p>Having more beige fat and brown fat</p>
<p>can increase your overall core metabolism.</p>
<p>In other words, the number of calories</p>
<p>that you burn per day,</p>
<p>and therefore the number of calories that you need</p>
<p>to either maintain or to lose weight.</p>
<p>The simple translation of this is that getting</p>
<p>into cold water for a total of 11 minutes, perhaps more,</p>
<p>but at least 11 minutes per week,</p>
<p>divided into two or four sessions,</p>
<p>can increase your core metabolism in part</p>
<p>by increasing your beige and brown fat stores.</p>
<p>And we know how that works, at least in animal models.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s now reason to suspect</p>
<p>that the exact same mechanisms are occurring in humans.</p>
<p>The primary way in which deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>converts white fat cells</p>
<p>into these more metabolically thermogenically active</p>
<p>metabolism increasing beige and brown fat cells</p>
<p>is because norepinephrine released</p>
<p>when we get into the cold,</p>
<p>binds to receptors on the surface of white fat cells</p>
<p>and activates downstream pathways such as UCP1.</p>
<p>So this is an uncoupling protein one</p>
<p>that acts on the mitochondrial metabolism of cells</p>
<p>and increases the mitochondrial output of those cells</p>
<p>and the mitochondrial density of those cells.</p>
<p>In other words, it takes a cell</p>
<p>that has a kind of a weak engine</p>
<p>or no engine for generating energy.</p>
<p>Although every cell has some mitochondria,</p>
<p>it takes cells that have very few mitochondria</p>
<p>and increases the engine size.</p>
<p>It kind of stokes the furnace of those particular cells</p>
<p>and actually can change gene expression in those cells.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure causes increases in norepinephrine</p>
<p>which bind to receptors on the surfaces of white fat cells,</p>
<p>which triggers the release of things like UCP1.</p>
<p>It also causes the release of things like PPAR gamma</p>
<p>and cofactor PGC1.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to refer you to a review</p>
<p>if you want to learn more about these.</p>
<p>For those of you that don&rsquo;t want to learn more,</p>
<p>all you need to know is that the downstream of all that</p>
<p>are increases in mitochondria and metabolism</p>
<p>and actual genetic changes in the white fat cells</p>
<p>that convert them into beige and brown fat cells.</p>
<p>This is especially important for adults</p>
<p>because babies and young children</p>
<p>actually don&rsquo;t have the ability to shiver</p>
<p>or they have a less robust capacity to shiver.</p>
<p>Very small babies really can&rsquo;t shiver.</p>
<p>So they have a lot of brown fat in order to keep them warm.</p>
<p>Young children eventually develop the ability to shiver</p>
<p>and maintain these brown fat stores</p>
<p>mainly around the clavicles, the heart, the upper spine,</p>
<p>and in the upper back.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no coincidence that kids can often run around</p>
<p>with a minimal of clothing and be comfortable</p>
<p>in environments that adults would be cold in.</p>
<p>As life goes on, we tend to lose beige and brown fat,</p>
<p>but this mechanism that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>points to the plasticity of white fat,</p>
<p>meaning the ability for white fat</p>
<p>to actually convert its identity</p>
<p>into this metabolically thermogenically enhancing form</p>
<p>of beige and brown fat.</p>
<p>So deliberate cold exposure is a terrific way</p>
<p>to increase your core metabolism.</p>
<p>And oftentimes critics will say,</p>
<p>well, the increase in metabolism isn&rsquo;t that significant.</p>
<p>Although I do want to point out again,</p>
<p>the 93% and 350% increases in metabolism</p>
<p>from that previous study.</p>
<p>But critics then will say,</p>
<p>well, that doesn&rsquo;t really translate to that big</p>
<p>of a caloric burn during the deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>But to that, you should say, ah,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s only limiting your optics</p>
<p>to just a portion of the effects</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>because deliberate cold exposure can also convert white fat</p>
<p>to beige fat and brown fat</p>
<p>and lead to these more lasting increases in metabolism.</p>
<p>So for any of you interested in increasing your metabolism</p>
<p>and or being comfortable in cold environments</p>
<p>and or being comfortable in terms of being able</p>
<p>to combat stress mentally,</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure I do believe is a powerful tool.</p>
<p>And there is simply no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and shouldn&rsquo;t use the same protocols</p>
<p>that I described earlier for building resilience</p>
<p>to increase metabolism.</p>
<p>Provided you&rsquo;re hitting that 11 minute per week threshold,</p>
<p>you ought to be stimulating both mechanisms,</p>
<p>increases in resilience and increases in core metabolism.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>most of the detailed studies on the conversion</p>
<p>of white fat to beige fat and brown fat</p>
<p>through the use of cold have been done in animal models,</p>
<p>but the human data are starting to emerge.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to do the deep dive into these mechanisms,</p>
<p>things like UCP-1, PPAR-gamma, et cetera,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beautiful review that was published recently</p>
<p>in the journal Cell,</p>
<p>which is one of the three apex journals,</p>
<p>Nature Science Cell.</p>
<p>And the title of that paper is</p>
<p>Adipose Tissue Plasticity in Health and Disease.</p>
<p>I love this review.</p>
<p>It has beautiful diagrams detailing all of the pathways</p>
<p>from cold to norepinephrine through UCP-1,</p>
<p>downstream of things like cyclic AMP.</p>
<p>If none of those names mean anything to you,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t need to know these mechanisms</p>
<p>to benefit from deliberate cold exposure protocols.</p>
<p>If those names do mean something to you,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re interested in exploring the downstream effects</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>and something else that&rsquo;s really nice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s covered in this paper</p>
<p>is how deliberate cold exposure interacts</p>
<p>with fasted states and fed states.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll also find this review very interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go too deeply into fasted states</p>
<p>and fed states right now.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that when we are fasted,</p>
<p>meaning when we haven&rsquo;t eaten for some period of time,</p>
<p>our baseline levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine</p>
<p>are already elevated.</p>
<p>And so cold exposure at those times</p>
<p>ought to have an even greater effect</p>
<p>on metabolism and resilience and so on.</p>
<p>So for you fasters or your intermittent fasters out there,</p>
<p>if you really want to get fancy,</p>
<p>you can do your deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>when you are fasted.</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t recommend doing it</p>
<p>with a very full stomach in any case.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before on this podcast,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is but one way,</p>
<p>and certainly there are other ways</p>
<p>to limit total caloric intake</p>
<p>for sake of maintaining or losing weight,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your goal.</p>
<p>I know many people are using and benefit</p>
<p>from intermittent fasting, however,</p>
<p>and so it certainly can be combined</p>
<p>with deliberate cold exposures</p>
<p>in order to get even greater increases</p>
<p>in norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are primarily interested</p>
<p>in using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to increase dopamine levels in your brain and body,</p>
<p>you can also do a combined protocol</p>
<p>whereby you ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>before the deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>This is based on a study that I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>entitled Caffeine Increases Striatal Dopamine</p>
<p>D2, D3 Receptor Availability in the Human Brain.</p>
<p>And as the title suggests, this study was done on humans</p>
<p>looking at the density and or efficacy</p>
<p>of these dopamine receptors</p>
<p>in an area of the brain called the striatum,</p>
<p>which is involved in planning and action</p>
<p>and also suppressing planning and action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved very closely</p>
<p>with whether or not we can engage in behavior</p>
<p>and withhold behavior,</p>
<p>the so-called go and no-go pathways in the brain.</p>
<p>Dopamine plays a critical role in that</p>
<p>and many other things as well as you now know.</p>
<p>So why would you want to ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>before deliberate cold exposure?</p>
<p>Well, as I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>dopamine can increase quite substantially</p>
<p>in response to deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>but dopamine on its own doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>It has to bind to receptors.</p>
<p>And this paper shows quite definitively</p>
<p>that ingesting caffeine, in this case,</p>
<p>it was 300 milligram dose of caffeine,</p>
<p>which is about the dose of caffeine</p>
<p>in two or three cups of coffee.</p>
<p>It depends on the strength of the coffee, of course,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not an outrageous amount of caffeine.</p>
<p>That increases the density</p>
<p>and or efficacy of these receptors,</p>
<p>which would allow that dopamine to have its greatest effect.</p>
<p>And for those of you that want to get really, really fancy,</p>
<p>I suppose you could do this fasted.</p>
<p>So you get the further increase in norepinephrine,</p>
<p>then you get the dopamine increase from the cold exposure,</p>
<p>the binding of the dopamine.</p>
<p>Although I do want to point out that at some point</p>
<p>you start layering together enough protocols</p>
<p>that you would be spending your entire day</p>
<p>trying to get this dopamine pulse.</p>
<p>And I would hope that you would have other activities</p>
<p>that you would engage in.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re getting up in the morning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fasted because you haven&rsquo;t eaten all night</p>
<p>and you have a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>and then 60 minutes later you take your cold shower</p>
<p>or two hours later you do your cold immersion</p>
<p>or your cold shower,</p>
<p>you would be layering together these different mechanisms</p>
<p>of dopamine receptors, epinephrine, and so forth</p>
<p>in a way that at least to me doesn&rsquo;t seem incompatible</p>
<p>with having some other life,</p>
<p>like going to school and having relationships, et cetera.</p>
<p>And this increase in dopamine,</p>
<p>particularly in the striatum is not a trivial one.</p>
<p>I do want to point out as the authors do</p>
<p>that preclinical studies have shown</p>
<p>that increases in striatal dopamine</p>
<p>induced by things like modafinil,</p>
<p>which is used to treat ADHD and treat narcolepsy</p>
<p>is necessary for their wake promoting actions.</p>
<p>What this really says is that</p>
<p>just having elevated levels of dopamine from a drug</p>
<p>or from an ice bath or what have you</p>
<p>is not sufficient to get the effects of dopamine.</p>
<p>You really need the receptors to be available</p>
<p>and you need those receptors to be available</p>
<p>in the appropriate density</p>
<p>and you need those receptors to be available</p>
<p>in the appropriate density in the striatum in particular.</p>
<p>So I think there are a number of reasons why</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s compatible with the other aspects of your health,</p>
<p>because of course always you have to consider this</p>
<p>on a background of cardiovascular health</p>
<p>and blood pressure, et cetera,</p>
<p>that ingesting a cup or two of coffee</p>
<p>an hour before your ice bath, maybe fasted as well,</p>
<p>could be quite beneficial for increasing dopamine</p>
<p>over quite extended periods of time.</p>
<p>A couple of key points that you&rsquo;ll want to pay attention to</p>
<p>in thinking about deliberate cold exposure and metabolism.</p>
<p>In the Soberg study, they also explored the use of sauna</p>
<p>and how to use sauna, meaning deliberate heat</p>
<p>in conjunction with cold.</p>
<p>We are going to do an entire episode</p>
<p>about the use of heat for health and performance.</p>
<p>So that is not the focus now.</p>
<p>However, it does raise an important point</p>
<p>that we do need to address at this moment,</p>
<p>which is if you are using sauna</p>
<p>or if you are taking warm showers,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re simply using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>of any kind, should you get into the heat afterward</p>
<p>or before or not at all?</p>
<p>And this is where we can point</p>
<p>to the so-called Soberg principle.</p>
<p>At least I call it the Soberg principle.</p>
<p>The Soberg principle named after first author</p>
<p>of this study I referred to earlier, Dr. Susanna Soberg.</p>
<p>In science, it is appropriate to take a key piece of data</p>
<p>and call it a principle.</p>
<p>If in fact it translates to something larger,</p>
<p>which I believe it does.</p>
<p>It is generally not appropriate for people</p>
<p>to name a principle after themselves,</p>
<p>although there are a few scientists that have done that.</p>
<p>So I have named it the Soberg principle,</p>
<p>but I did that to give it appropriate credit</p>
<p>to Dr. Susanna Soberg, who discovered that</p>
<p>and pointed out quite appropriately</p>
<p>that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolism</p>
<p>through deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>you want to force yourself to reheat on your own</p>
<p>after the deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Meaning you wouldn&rsquo;t want to go from the cold shower</p>
<p>to a hot shower or from the cold shower to a sauna.</p>
<p>Rather, if you were going to start with a hot shower</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to start with a sauna,</p>
<p>that you would end with the cold</p>
<p>and then you would reheat naturally.</p>
<p>Now, I personally take a cold shower.</p>
<p>I do a few times a week or do cold immersion.</p>
<p>And because I&rsquo;m not specifically focused</p>
<p>on increasing metabolism, although I probably should be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m using it for now.</p>
<p>I will take a hot shower afterwards.</p>
<p>And in doing so, I&rsquo;m short-circuiting</p>
<p>some of the further metabolic increases</p>
<p>that I would achieve were I to just end with the cold.</p>
<p>So the Soberg principle is,</p>
<p>if you want to increase your metabolism, end with cold.</p>
<p>And we can take this a step further</p>
<p>and say that if you want to use deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to increase metabolism, that you should make sure</p>
<p>that you get to the point where you shiver.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is that there are a series</p>
<p>of studies, but in particular, one study published</p>
<p>in the journal Nature, excellent journal in the year 2018,</p>
<p>showing that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>that evokes shivering from the muscles</p>
<p>causes the release of a molecule called succinate</p>
<p>from the muscles.</p>
<p>And that succinate plays a key role</p>
<p>in activating brown fat thermogenesis,</p>
<p>which you now have heard about and understand</p>
<p>as critical to the increases in metabolism</p>
<p>caused by deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So what this means is if you want to increase</p>
<p>your metabolism, end on cold, that&rsquo;s the Soberg principle.</p>
<p>And as best you can, try and get to the point</p>
<p>where you are shivering,</p>
<p>either when you are in the cold exposure</p>
<p>or immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>Now, one efficient way to do this is to, for instance,</p>
<p>you could get into the cold shower for a minute</p>
<p>or two minutes or three minutes, uncomfortably cold,</p>
<p>but safe to stay in.</p>
<p>Remember, that&rsquo;s our general rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Then turn off the water and stand there.</p>
<p>Make sure that you&rsquo;re not holding yourself</p>
<p>close to your body.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not hugging yourself to try and keep yourself warm,</p>
<p>but rather your limbs are extended at your sides.</p>
<p>And then if that fails to induce shiver,</p>
<p>then to turn on the cold water again</p>
<p>and then turn it off again.</p>
<p>So alternating perhaps a minute to three minutes</p>
<p>of cold exposure followed by a minute to three minutes</p>
<p>of drying out in air and going back</p>
<p>into the cold exposure, et cetera.</p>
<p>I can tell you this from experience.</p>
<p>This is a pretty brutal protocol.</p>
<p>If you have never tried getting into an ice bath</p>
<p>or cold water immersion or cold shower for one minute</p>
<p>and then getting out and trying to stand there</p>
<p>with your arms extended in cool or cold air</p>
<p>for one minute and then getting back into the cold shower</p>
<p>or water immersion, you are in for an experience</p>
<p>because even for those of you</p>
<p>that are pretty shiver resistant,</p>
<p>you will find that it is much, much harder</p>
<p>to get out of that cold water and stand there,</p>
<p>arms extended and drying off by evaporation,</p>
<p>which further draws heat from the body</p>
<p>than it is to wrap yourself in a towel,</p>
<p>get in a warm shower or a sauna.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certainly no requirement to end on cold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly no requirement to induce shiver,</p>
<p>but if your primary goal is to induce increases</p>
<p>in metabolism, both in the short-term and in the long-term</p>
<p>following the cold exposure,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;ll want to end on cold</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll want to find a way to shiver</p>
<p>provided that the level of cold</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re exposing yourself to</p>
<p>is still safe for you overall.</p>
<p>So up until now, I&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about deliberate cold exposure as a potent stimulus</p>
<p>for the release of norepinephrine in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And indeed it is, but the way I&rsquo;ve been describing it</p>
<p>has been in the context of circulating plasma levels</p>
<p>of norepinephrine, meaning circulating within the blood.</p>
<p>What I haven&rsquo;t mentioned, but is absolutely true,</p>
<p>is that the fat cells themselves</p>
<p>actually receive input from neurons.</p>
<p>So there are neurons that release norepinephrine</p>
<p>in response to cold directly into the fat.</p>
<p>So I want to give you this picture</p>
<p>of how the architecture of all this works</p>
<p>because I think it can help you navigate</p>
<p>and indeed build better deliberate cold exposure protocols.</p>
<p>Your adrenal glands release norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Your brain has sites within it like the locus coeruleus</p>
<p>that release norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>But there are also neurons within your skin that sense cold</p>
<p>and other neurons that can directly release norepinephrine</p>
<p>into the fat stores and cause those white fat cells</p>
<p>to convert to beige and brown fat.</p>
<p>And I think this particular aspect of our physiology</p>
<p>is often overlooked in studies.</p>
<p>And when people say,</p>
<p>well, the increases in metabolism aren&rsquo;t that great,</p>
<p>the circulating levels of norepinephrine,</p>
<p>those are very large, but they&rsquo;re very transient and so on,</p>
<p>that fails to understand that neurons</p>
<p>that actually sense cold are in a position</p>
<p>to communicate via other neurons</p>
<p>directly to the fat cells</p>
<p>and release norepinephrine into those fat cells,</p>
<p>which as I pointed out earlier,</p>
<p>set off a huge set of immediate and long-term cascades</p>
<p>of even gene expression changes.</p>
<p>So the picture that I&rsquo;d like you to have in your mind</p>
<p>is that when you get into the cold,</p>
<p>yes, of course, you experience that as a experience of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do this, I&rsquo;m going to overcome this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to climb over these mental walls</p>
<p>that represent adrenaline release in my brain and body,</p>
<p>but also that your fat cells are receiving signals,</p>
<p>norepinephrine signals that are changing those fat cells</p>
<p>in the way that they metabolize energy.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to shift our attention</p>
<p>to the use of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for sake of physical performance.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of opinions out there</p>
<p>about the use of deliberate cold,</p>
<p>whether or not it should be done, for instance,</p>
<p>before or after exercise,</p>
<p>whether or not if done immediately after strength training</p>
<p>or hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>meaning training designed to grow muscles</p>
<p>or make them stronger,</p>
<p>whether or not it can inhibit that process</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I think today in looking over the literature</p>
<p>and trying to bring forward the simplest</p>
<p>and most straightforward</p>
<p>and yet scientifically grounded protocols,</p>
<p>we can set up some general guidelines</p>
<p>that will allow most if not all of you</p>
<p>to still extract the benefits of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>on physical performance</p>
<p>without getting too neurotic about the exact timing.</p>
<p>But for sake of discussion</p>
<p>and because it&rsquo;s a prominent theme</p>
<p>in many online communities,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just start with the big one out there,</p>
<p>meaning the question of whether or not doing an ice bath</p>
<p>or doing deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>or taking a cold shower</p>
<p>after strength slash hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>meaning training designed to increase strength</p>
<p>or, and, or I should say the size of muscles</p>
<p>will somehow short circuit or diminish that process,</p>
<p>whether or not it will reduce</p>
<p>or eliminate those strength gains and hypertrophy gains.</p>
<p>And the short answer that I was able to arrive at</p>
<p>on the basis of a review article</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment</p>
<p>and some other studies as well</p>
<p>is that if your main goal is hypertrophy and strength,</p>
<p>it is probably best to avoid cold water immersion</p>
<p>and ice bath immersion</p>
<p>in the four hours immediately following that strength</p>
<p>and or hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>Again, if your main goal is to achieve hypertrophy</p>
<p>or strength or some combination of those,</p>
<p>probably best to avoid cold water immersion up to the neck</p>
<p>or ice bath immersion up to the neck</p>
<p>immediately after strength and hypertrophy training</p>
<p>and extending out to about four hours after that training.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really neurotic about this,</p>
<p>then perhaps you&rsquo;d want to move the cold water exposure</p>
<p>to a different day entirely,</p>
<p>but it all depends on how neurotically attached you are</p>
<p>to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s your goal, terrific.</p>
<p>Well, then probably moving the cold exposure</p>
<p>four hours or more away from that training</p>
<p>is going to be necessary for you.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll notice I did not talk about cold showers.</p>
<p>And the reason I did not talk about cold showers</p>
<p>is that there simply are not very many studies</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure through cold showers</p>
<p>for the reasons I talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that taking a brief cold shower</p>
<p>after a strength or hypertrophy training session</p>
<p>would completely reverse or short circuit</p>
<p>the effects of that strength and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re neurotically attached</p>
<p>to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy</p>
<p>out of your training sessions,</p>
<p>then by all means err on the side of caution</p>
<p>and wait four hours or more to do your cold shower</p>
<p>just as you would wait four hours or more</p>
<p>to do your cold water immersion.</p>
<p>Now there are nice data pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that doing cold water immersion after a hard run,</p>
<p>so endurance training or even sprint and interval training,</p>
<p>or after a weight workout where your main focus</p>
<p>is on performance of those movements,</p>
<p>or after a skill training workout</p>
<p>where your main focus on performance of those movements,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no reason to think</p>
<p>that that cold water immersion or ice bath or cold shower</p>
<p>would inhibit the progress or the stimulus</p>
<p>that would lead to progress</p>
<p>that occurred during that training session.</p>
<p>In other words, I don&rsquo;t see any reason</p>
<p>based on the literature</p>
<p>to avoid deliberate cold exposure immediately after training</p>
<p>again, unless your goal is hypertrophy and strength.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s a very nice review</p>
<p>that was recently published on deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>and how it can impact physical performance,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s done before or after</p>
<p>different types of training and so forth.</p>
<p>The paper is entitled,</p>
<p>Impact of Cold Water Immersion</p>
<p>Compared with Passive Recovery</p>
<p>Following a Single Bout of Strenuous Exercise</p>
<p>on Athletic Performance in Physically Active Participants,</p>
<p>a Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression.</p>
<p>So this is a meta-analysis of 52 studies</p>
<p>that looked at a tremendous number of variables</p>
<p>and contexts as you would expect</p>
<p>in a meta-analysis of 52 studies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read you the conclusions of the study</p>
<p>and I will provide a link.</p>
<p>We certainly don&rsquo;t have the time</p>
<p>to go through all the details of the study.</p>
<p>I will highlight a few specific outcomes</p>
<p>that I found particularly interesting,</p>
<p>but here I am paraphrasing their conclusions</p>
<p>that cold water immersion,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize immersion, not cold showers,</p>
<p>but cold water immersion,</p>
<p>they say was an effective recovery tool</p>
<p>after high intensity exercise.</p>
<p>They observed positive outcomes,</p>
<p>meaning improvements in certain variables</p>
<p>for muscular power, muscular soreness,</p>
<p>meaning reduced muscular soreness,</p>
<p>increased muscular power,</p>
<p>perceived recovery after 24 hours of exercise.</p>
<p>However, there were certain forms of exercise</p>
<p>that were not benefited by cold water immersion,</p>
<p>such as eccentric exercise,</p>
<p>exercise focusing only on the lowering component</p>
<p>or the so-called eccentric component</p>
<p>of resistance exercise.</p>
<p>They saw some very interesting dose response relationships</p>
<p>for things like endurance training,</p>
<p>meaning the longer the cold exposure,</p>
<p>post-endurance training,</p>
<p>the more improvement in endurance performance,</p>
<p>reductions in circulating creatine kinases</p>
<p>and things that relate to muscle damage</p>
<p>under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Some point in the future, by the way,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do an entire episode</p>
<p>on creatine and creatine kinases,</p>
<p>which are important not just for muscular function,</p>
<p>but also for brain function.</p>
<p>But the basic takeaway was that cold water immersion</p>
<p>performed after high-intensity exercise</p>
<p>was beneficial from a number of different standpoints</p>
<p>and indicated that shorter duration cold exposure</p>
<p>and lower temperatures can improve the efficacy</p>
<p>of cold water exposure</p>
<p>if used after high-intensity exercise, okay?</p>
<p>There I&rsquo;m directly pulling from their conclusions.</p>
<p>So what this says is that it&rsquo;s not just those</p>
<p>longer duration, 30, 45 minute, and 60 minute protocols</p>
<p>of cold water immersion that we discussed earlier,</p>
<p>but also shorter duration, one minute, three minute,</p>
<p>five minute exposures to lower temperatures,</p>
<p>temperatures that would make you psychologically</p>
<p>want to get out as soon as you possibly can,</p>
<p>but again, that you can safely stay in,</p>
<p>done after training really have been shown</p>
<p>to improve outcomes in terms of reducing soreness</p>
<p>and improving training efficacy,</p>
<p>meaning your ability to get back into training more quickly</p>
<p>and thereby deliver more training stimuli to a given muscle</p>
<p>or in your endurance training protocol.</p>
<p>Translate to English what this means</p>
<p>is that taking a cold shower or getting into an ice bath</p>
<p>or some other form of cold water immersion</p>
<p>within the immediate minutes</p>
<p>or even the immediate hours following your training</p>
<p>has been shown to be beneficial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a number of you have questions, for instance,</p>
<p>how long should you be in that cold exposure?</p>
<p>Is it the same as the 11 minute threshold described earlier?</p>
<p>To be honest with you,</p>
<p>there are not enough studies to really point</p>
<p>to the critical threshold for eliminating</p>
<p>or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness</p>
<p>or for getting maximal results</p>
<p>from power and endurance training,</p>
<p>but this study does make a couple of key points</p>
<p>and here I will just paraphrase.</p>
<p>For instance, that cold water immersion</p>
<p>is more likely to positively influence</p>
<p>muscular power performance,</p>
<p>to reduce muscle soreness,</p>
<p>to reduce serum creatine kinase</p>
<p>and to improve perceived recovery</p>
<p>after high intensity exercise</p>
<p>as compared with passive recovery.</p>
<p>This can be translated to cold water exposure</p>
<p>after training is beneficial</p>
<p>and probably better than passive recovery</p>
<p>from a number of standpoints.</p>
<p>In addition, they say that dose response relationships,</p>
<p>meaning the amount and the degree of cold</p>
<p>that people were exposed to</p>
<p>and how often they did that</p>
<p>in particular in lower temperature cold immersion.</p>
<p>So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols</p>
<p>that are one minute or two minutes,</p>
<p>three minutes, maybe five minutes,</p>
<p>but that one couldn&rsquo;t stay in there longer</p>
<p>because it feels stressful and one wants to get out,</p>
<p>may be more effective after high intensity exercise</p>
<p>for removal of serum creatine kinase</p>
<p>as well that these shorter duration</p>
<p>cold water immersion approaches</p>
<p>may be more effective</p>
<p>after high intensity endurance performance as well.</p>
<p>So all of this can be translated to say</p>
<p>that unless your main goal is hypertrophy and strength,</p>
<p>that cold exposure, ideally cold immersion</p>
<p>in cold water or ice bath,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t have access to that,</p>
<p>then cold showers is likely going to be beneficial</p>
<p>if done immediately after</p>
<p>or in the minutes or hours after your training,</p>
<p>especially high intensity training.</p>
<p>One particularly nice thing about this meta-analysis</p>
<p>is that it included some studies</p>
<p>that involve the use of cooling packs.</p>
<p>So again, vests that can hold essentially ice packs</p>
<p>and indeed even cryotherapy chambers and so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nice table in the study.</p>
<p>If you want to get really detailed</p>
<p>and go and look specifically at those studies,</p>
<p>I invite you to do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put a link to this study</p>
<p>in the caption for this episode.</p>
<p>But all in all, what this study shows</p>
<p>is that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can be very useful for recovery,</p>
<p>likely through reductions in inflammation</p>
<p>in muscle and connective tissue.</p>
<p>And while this study did not look specifically</p>
<p>at the mechanisms of reduced inflammation</p>
<p>caused by deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>those mechanisms are somewhat known.</p>
<p>There are a number of studies that have pointed to the fact</p>
<p>that deliberate cold and cold generally</p>
<p>can reduce inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>such as IL-6, interleukin-6.</p>
<p>It can increase anti-inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>such as interleukin-10 and so on.</p>
<p>Without getting into all those details,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sufficient to say that</p>
<p>if you are somebody who experiences</p>
<p>a lot of delayed onset muscle soreness,</p>
<p>taking a cold shower after your training</p>
<p>or getting into a cold immersion after your training,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a few hours later, ought to help.</p>
<p>And if you are doing particularly intense training,</p>
<p>then you probably want to ratchet up</p>
<p>the number of cold exposure sessions that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>even if those have to be done</p>
<p>on separate days from your training,</p>
<p>because a lot of the inflammatory effects of training,</p>
<p>endurance and strength training,</p>
<p>are actually occurring some hours</p>
<p>away from the training stimulus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that inflammation</p>
<p>goes up radically during training, which it often can,</p>
<p>but that it can occur even in the days</p>
<p>and even weeks afterwards, depending on how intense</p>
<p>and how long duration that training is.</p>
<p>So deliberate cold exposure is very powerful</p>
<p>as an anti-inflammatory tool.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize the topic that we touched on</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>which are those glabrous skin surfaces,</p>
<p>the hands, the upper face, and the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>through which heat is especially good at leaving the body.</p>
<p>And another way of putting that is that one can cool</p>
<p>the body much more efficiently</p>
<p>through the glabrous skin surfaces.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to understand all of the science</p>
<p>behind this and all of the various applications,</p>
<p>I invite you to please listen to the episode</p>
<p>that I did with Dr. Craig Heller,</p>
<p>again, in the biology department at Stanford.</p>
<p>For sake of this episode, I&rsquo;m just going to detail</p>
<p>a couple of findings from his laboratory.</p>
<p>The first one dealing with exercise-induced hyperthermia,</p>
<p>because I think this is very interesting</p>
<p>and it can even save lives</p>
<p>if you understand the way this works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular paper that focuses on this,</p>
<p>and we will put a link to this as well.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Novel Application of Chemical Cold Packs</p>
<p>for Treatment of Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia,</p>
<p>a Randomized Control Trial.</p>
<p>This is a pretty brutal study,</p>
<p>brutal for the subjects, that is.</p>
<p>What this study involved was having subjects</p>
<p>walk on a treadmill at a pretty significant incline,</p>
<p>anywhere from nine to 17%,</p>
<p>wearing a substantial amount of clothing</p>
<p>that was not well-ventilated,</p>
<p>and the room was kept to 40 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>which is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>This is definitely not something to do at home.</p>
<p>This study was designed to induce hyperthermia,</p>
<p>which, as I mentioned earlier, can be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>And they compared two types of cooling.</p>
<p>In the first form of cooling</p>
<p>that they call traditional cooling,</p>
<p>they had ice packs on their neck,</p>
<p>in their armpits, and in their groin.</p>
<p>And in the other group,</p>
<p>there was the so-called glabrous skin cooling.</p>
<p>So the palms, the soles of the feet,</p>
<p>which were actually,</p>
<p>so they were cooling inside the boots or inside of gloves,</p>
<p>and on the upper portion of the face.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway of the study</p>
<p>is that by cooling the glabrous skin,</p>
<p>the subjects were able to sustain this walking</p>
<p>on these inclined treadmills for much longer</p>
<p>than were the people who received traditional cooling.</p>
<p>And also the return to baseline temperature</p>
<p>was much faster in the glabrous skin cooling group.</p>
<p>So how this translates to the real world</p>
<p>is that if ever you are hyperthermic</p>
<p>or someone else is hyperthermic,</p>
<p>one way to cool them down quickly</p>
<p>is to cool these palmar glabrous,</p>
<p>soles of the feet glabrous,</p>
<p>and upper portion of the face glabrous portions of the body</p>
<p>using cool rags, using ice packs,</p>
<p>or using any number of different</p>
<p>cold objects or temperatures.</p>
<p>One key thing, if you&rsquo;re going to use glabrous skin cooling,</p>
<p>is that whatever you use to cool those surfaces</p>
<p>cannot be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>Because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the arteriovenous asthmoses,</p>
<p>these portals of arteries directly to veins</p>
<p>that exist only in these glabrous skin surfaces,</p>
<p>the way that they&rsquo;re able to cool the body</p>
<p>and essentially pass cool into the body,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s not really what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually extracting heat from the body,</p>
<p>to be technical, they&rsquo;re extracting heat from the body,</p>
<p>the only way they can do that</p>
<p>is if those veins don&rsquo;t collapse,</p>
<p>and veins will collapse if they are made very, very cold.</p>
<p>So if you want to use glabrous skin cooling</p>
<p>to offset hyperthermia,</p>
<p>or for the other forms of performance,</p>
<p>which we will talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>you need to use a cool object or surface</p>
<p>that is not so cold that it causes vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>And this can be a little bit tough to dial in,</p>
<p>meaning it can be tough to identify such an object.</p>
<p>And for that reason, Dr. Heller and some of his colleagues</p>
<p>have developed a commercial product called the CoolMitt,</p>
<p>you can actually go to their website, coolmitt.com,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any financial or other relationship to them.</p>
<p>I know they&rsquo;ve been developing this technology</p>
<p>for some period of time,</p>
<p>it involves a glove that you put your hand into,</p>
<p>it circulates water of a given temperature,</p>
<p>and it does so at a temperature</p>
<p>that is sure to not cause vasoconstriction of the palm.</p>
<p>And you may be asking,</p>
<p>how can you just put your hand into one glove</p>
<p>and have this work?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s how powerful these glabrous skin surfaces are.</p>
<p>Even just by cooling one palm,</p>
<p>the core body temperature drops radically.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s their commercial technology.</p>
<p>I know that some people out there</p>
<p>have started to experiment with a home version of this,</p>
<p>which would be taking a package, for instance,</p>
<p>of frozen blueberries or some other cold drink</p>
<p>or cold metal object and actually bringing it into the gym</p>
<p>or out on a run.</p>
<p>There are even people who are now developing</p>
<p>cooled bicycle handles for long rides.</p>
<p>This might seem a little kooky or crazy to you,</p>
<p>but as you&rsquo;ll soon hear in the study I&rsquo;m about to describe,</p>
<p>the increases in endurance</p>
<p>and in the volume of strength training</p>
<p>that people can conduct</p>
<p>if they appropriately cool their body</p>
<p>through these glabrous skin portals</p>
<p>is actually quite significant.</p>
<p>So again, as it relates to hyperthermia,</p>
<p>if someone is overheating,</p>
<p>by all means, try and get them out of that heat,</p>
<p>get them to stop exercising.</p>
<p>You can die from hyperthermia.</p>
<p>Try and cool the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>the palms of their hands,</p>
<p>and the upper portion of their face.</p>
<p>That does not mean that it would be a bad idea</p>
<p>to put cold water on the top of their head.</p>
<p>That probably would also help, and perhaps on their neck.</p>
<p>What is probably not going to be a good idea</p>
<p>is to do the more standard thing</p>
<p>of draping someone in cold towels</p>
<p>on the surface of their body,</p>
<p>because as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>that thermostat in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>the medial preoptic area,</p>
<p>will typically react to that</p>
<p>by increasing core body temperature further.</p>
<p>The effects of glabrous skin cooling</p>
<p>on physical performance are truly remarkable</p>
<p>provided the glabrous skin cooling is done correctly.</p>
<p>And I want to point out</p>
<p>that the main degree of effect is on volume</p>
<p>or the ability to do more work.</p>
<p>And I want to point this out</p>
<p>because I think that many people,</p>
<p>certainly in the exercise science community,</p>
<p>but even in the general public,</p>
<p>when they hear about some of these effects</p>
<p>that are measured in the laboratory,</p>
<p>they sort of look at those effects a bit askance,</p>
<p>and they think, well, that&rsquo;s not possible, right?</p>
<p>Effects, for instance, that have been documented</p>
<p>showing doubling or tripling of the number of dips</p>
<p>that one can do in a relatively short amount of time,</p>
<p>or doubling of the number of pull-ups one can do,</p>
<p>or 14% increases in strength,</p>
<p>or even comparable degrees in increase</p>
<p>in weight training output</p>
<p>to people who are on performance-enhancing drugs,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Part of the confusion is that</p>
<p>the effects of proper palmer cooling,</p>
<p>because it almost always is done by palmer cooling</p>
<p>and less often in these experiments</p>
<p>by cooling of the bottoms of the feet</p>
<p>and the upper portion of the face,</p>
<p>but those effects tend to be</p>
<p>the ability to do more work over time.</p>
<p>And just to illustrate some of the major effects</p>
<p>that the Heller lab has seen,</p>
<p>and that are documented in this manuscript</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll share with you in a moment,</p>
<p>the typical protocol is to have people come in</p>
<p>and do some endurance training,</p>
<p>so running on a treadmill,</p>
<p>and to have a condition where</p>
<p>one group is actually doing palmer cooling</p>
<p>while they are on a bike or on a treadmill,</p>
<p>and inevitably the outcome is that they can do more work.</p>
<p>They can pedal further at a given speed,</p>
<p>or they can run longer at a given speed</p>
<p>than people who are not doing palmer cooling,</p>
<p>or who are receiving cooling</p>
<p>by way of cold compress to the back of the neck</p>
<p>or ice pack to the armpits, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the effects of palmer cooling</p>
<p>are very clear and very robust.</p>
<p>And in the context of endurance exercise,</p>
<p>almost always allow people to do more work,</p>
<p>to go longer with less perceived effort</p>
<p>and to quit later, so to speak.</p>
<p>In terms of strength training,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve looked at the capacity to perform sets of dips.</p>
<p>So one of the more famous examples of this</p>
<p>that Dr. Heller shares in the episode that we did earlier,</p>
<p>and that you can find at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>involves someone coming in and doing sets of dips,</p>
<p>maybe 40 dips,</p>
<p>this person actually could do 40 dips on their first set,</p>
<p>then resting for a period of two to three minutes,</p>
<p>and then doing 35,</p>
<p>and then resting for a period of two or three minutes,</p>
<p>and then doing progressively fewer and fewer and fewer</p>
<p>to the point where over a period of time,</p>
<p>they add up the total number of dips that they can do,</p>
<p>and then they have them come back</p>
<p>after a period of recovery.</p>
<p>So not immediately after, but take a couple of days,</p>
<p>come back and do effectively the same protocol,</p>
<p>but during their rest periods,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing two minutes of palmer cooling,</p>
<p>which essentially allows heat to move out of the body,</p>
<p>lowering core body temperature, in other words.</p>
<p>And what they find is that they see enormous increases</p>
<p>in the total number of dips that people can do,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the person goes</p>
<p>from being able to do 40 dips</p>
<p>to being able to do 50 dips or 60 dips on that first set.</p>
<p>What it means is that they are able to do 40</p>
<p>on the first set, then 40 on the second,</p>
<p>then 38 on the third, and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>so that the total duration of the workout is extended,</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re doing much more work,</p>
<p>even though it takes more time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important point,</p>
<p>and I think a point that perhaps wasn&rsquo;t as clear</p>
<p>or as clearly made by me in the previous episodes</p>
<p>that discussed this topic.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in exploring palmer cooling,</p>
<p>first of all, I recommend taking a brief glance</p>
<p>or even a deep dive into this study,</p>
<p>which is entitled Work Volume and Strength Training Responses</p>
<p>to Resistive Exercise Improve</p>
<p>with Periodic Heat Extraction from the Palm.</p>
<p>In this study, they describe big increases in anaerobic,</p>
<p>meaning strength training output,</p>
<p>things like improvement in dips,</p>
<p>improvement in bench press,</p>
<p>improvement in pull-ups, et cetera, in human subjects.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really nice study</p>
<p>and points to some of the protocols</p>
<p>that you might be able to adapt in your own setup.</p>
<p>For instance, over six weeks of pull-up training,</p>
<p>palm cooling in between sets,</p>
<p>improved volume by 144%,</p>
<p>and this was in experienced subjects.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>because a lot of studies of strength training</p>
<p>and improvements in hypertrophy and strength</p>
<p>are done in inexperienced, untrained athletes,</p>
<p>which changes the picture somewhat</p>
<p>compared to experienced athletes.</p>
<p>They found that strength,</p>
<p>meaning the one repetition maximum,</p>
<p>increased 22% over 10 weeks in bench press training.</p>
<p>And they point to the particularly strong effects</p>
<p>of using palmer cooling when people reach plateaus</p>
<p>in endurance and strength training.</p>
<p>And there, I think it&rsquo;s an important point.</p>
<p>I think that if you&rsquo;re going to explore palmer cooling,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not the sort of thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to do in every run</p>
<p>or in every bout of cycling</p>
<p>or in every strength training session,</p>
<p>but that it might be used to vastly increase your volume</p>
<p>or vastly increase your endurance in a given session</p>
<p>or a set of sessions in order to push through plateaus.</p>
<p>A particularly interesting point in light of that</p>
<p>is Dr. Heller has observed again and again</p>
<p>that palmer cooling reduces delayed onset muscle soreness</p>
<p>or can eliminate it entirely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>because it also points to the fact</p>
<p>that reducing core body temperature</p>
<p>may somehow be involved in short circuiting</p>
<p>the normal mechanisms of delayed onset muscle soreness.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, how would temperature be involved</p>
<p>in delayed onset muscle soreness?</p>
<p>Well, I want to refer you back to the meta-analysis</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>where the short duration,</p>
<p>very cold temperature exposure after training</p>
<p>did indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness</p>
<p>in part through reduction, excuse me, in creatine kinase.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not inconceivable that temperature</p>
<p>and delayed onset muscle soreness are related.</p>
<p>And that raises perhaps the most important point,</p>
<p>which is the way that palmer cooling can improve performance</p>
<p>by way of reducing core body temperature is known.</p>
<p>And that is because when one engages in exercise</p>
<p>or muscular output of any kind,</p>
<p>strength or endurance exercise,</p>
<p>the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform</p>
<p>is actually very narrow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enzyme called pyruvate kinase,</p>
<p>which is critical to muscle contractions.</p>
<p>And pyruvate kinase can only function</p>
<p>in a very narrow range of temperatures.</p>
<p>If that temperature gets too hot,</p>
<p>meaning if the muscle heats up locally,</p>
<p>whether or not by running or cycling or swimming</p>
<p>or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle</p>
<p>to continue to contract is reduced</p>
<p>and eventually is short-circuited completely.</p>
<p>And I think this is a much underexplored</p>
<p>or at least a much under-discussed aspect</p>
<p>of so-called muscular failure</p>
<p>or the failure of one to continue to endure in running.</p>
<p>So for instance, when you run</p>
<p>as compared to a bench press or something,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t stop running</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t actually contract the muscles further,</p>
<p>but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue</p>
<p>are conveyed to the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crosstalk there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably bi-directional and people stop.</p>
<p>They quit, right?</p>
<p>This is the quitting reflex.</p>
<p>In strength training,</p>
<p>one can no longer perform a repetition</p>
<p>or set of repetitions in part</p>
<p>because of heating up of the muscle locally.</p>
<p>There are other mechanisms as well, of course,</p>
<p>and I realized that.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s very clear from the Palmer cooling work</p>
<p>is that by simply holding onto a cool object,</p>
<p>remember, not an object so cold</p>
<p>that it constricts the vessels of the palms</p>
<p>or constricts the vessels on the bottoms of the feet,</p>
<p>but by holding onto a relatively cool object</p>
<p>in one or both hands in between sets for two minutes or so,</p>
<p>you can very efficiently reduce your core body temperature.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>reduce the temperature of the muscles</p>
<p>that are doing the work,</p>
<p>increase the capacity for pyruvate kinase</p>
<p>to continue to allow your muscles to contract</p>
<p>and thereby allow you to do more volume of endurance</p>
<p>and strength training.</p>
<p>So a simple protocol that Dr. Heller passed to me</p>
<p>is find a relatively cool object.</p>
<p>So you could, for instance,</p>
<p>fill two bottles with cold water,</p>
<p>maybe put a few ice cubes in there, right?</p>
<p>This is not exact</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>the commercial CoolMitt product here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about an at-home version</p>
<p>or use a pack of frozen blueberries or broccoli,</p>
<p>the sort of pack of those as what he described.</p>
<p>And then in between sets to put your hands,</p>
<p>and ideally you&rsquo;d put the bottoms of your feet,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not always feasible in most gyms</p>
<p>where they won&rsquo;t let you take off your shoes and so forth.</p>
<p>But to put the palms of your hands on that cool surface</p>
<p>for a minute or two minutes between sets</p>
<p>and then returning to your sets of work.</p>
<p>Now, if you are heating up through other mechanisms,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re wearing a stocking cap</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a very warm environment,</p>
<p>this might not have as potent an effect</p>
<p>as if you were to do this cooling</p>
<p>in a more moderate environment,</p>
<p>wearing lighter clothing, et cetera.</p>
<p>So by all means, warm up to do your exercise,</p>
<p>lubricate your joints and get into a place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not going to injure yourself</p>
<p>doing whatever form of exercise you do.</p>
<p>But then if you&rsquo;d like to explore palmer cooling,</p>
<p>I know a number of people who&rsquo;ve written to me saying</p>
<p>they heard about palmer cooling</p>
<p>on the episode with Dr. Heller.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve tried this and they see quite excellent results.</p>
<p>It does take some discipline, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to just kind of hang out in the gym</p>
<p>and play on your phone in between sets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another to do deliberate cooling with your palms</p>
<p>or the bottoms of your feet</p>
<p>or the upper portion of your face.</p>
<p>You might get some weird looks,</p>
<p>but of course you&rsquo;ll be the one doing</p>
<p>some significantly more volume,</p>
<p>not experiencing delayed onset muscle soreness</p>
<p>and achieving better endurance and strength gains</p>
<p>were you to do this properly.</p>
<p>Now, as a final topic related</p>
<p>to the use of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for improving health and performance,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to touch on this theme that exists online</p>
<p>on social media, on YouTube,</p>
<p>and in various fitness communities</p>
<p>of using deliberate cold exposure to the groin,</p>
<p>in particular to the testicles</p>
<p>in order to try and increase testosterone.</p>
<p>And while this might sound really kooky,</p>
<p>indeed, this practice exists.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you were to go on the Amazon,</p>
<p>there are actually ice pack underwear</p>
<p>that are being marketed for sake of increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>Now I am not aware of any specific well-controlled studies</p>
<p>that show that this indeed works.</p>
<p>I can imagine based on what I know</p>
<p>about the nervous system, testosterone and cold, et cetera,</p>
<p>that there are a couple of mechanisms</p>
<p>by which one might experience increases in testosterone</p>
<p>as a consequence of deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>First off, let me say,</p>
<p>there is no reason why you would have to</p>
<p>apply these ice packs in the way that I just described.</p>
<p>One could, of course, take a cold shower.</p>
<p>One could, of course, use cold immersion of various kinds,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still going to get that exposure</p>
<p>of the groin and the testicles to cold.</p>
<p>Now I should point out that people do report,</p>
<p>at least anecdotally, increases in testosterone</p>
<p>as a consequence of this practice.</p>
<p>And I have to imagine</p>
<p>that they are measuring their serum testosterone,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not just guessing</p>
<p>that their testosterone went up.</p>
<p>If you know of a study exploring this directly,</p>
<p>please let me know, put it in the comment section on YouTube</p>
<p>or even just email me.</p>
<p>We have a email that you can find at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Please email me the reference.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to find a reference,</p>
<p>but I can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms</p>
<p>by which deliberate cold exposure to the groin</p>
<p>and particularly the testicles would increase testosterone.</p>
<p>The first is somewhat direct,</p>
<p>which is that anytime you cool a body surface,</p>
<p>that if it&rsquo;s cold enough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>And then subsequently,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get a rebound increase in vasodilation,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re going to constrict the blood vessels</p>
<p>in that area.</p>
<p>And then after the cold is removed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be more blood flow to that area.</p>
<p>And of course, blood flow relates to organ health</p>
<p>and tissue health generally.</p>
<p>So perfusion of that region and the gonads, to be specific,</p>
<p>with additional blood,</p>
<p>you could imagine in some ways increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reasonably plausible.</p>
<p>The other probably more likely mechanism</p>
<p>relates to the dopamine increases caused by cold exposure</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Again, anytime you have a somewhat stressful stimulus,</p>
<p>but in particular with cold exposure,</p>
<p>it seems that the catecholamines, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>epinephrine, and dopamine all increase.</p>
<p>And dopamine is known to be in the pathway</p>
<p>that can stimulate testosterone.</p>
<p>And so while there isn&rsquo;t a direct relationship</p>
<p>between dopamine stimulating testosterone,</p>
<p>there is an interesting pathway</p>
<p>whereby dopamine increases can trigger increases</p>
<p>in things like luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>which can trigger increases in testosterone</p>
<p>as well as estrogen for that matter.</p>
<p>So I know that there are a lot of people out there</p>
<p>that are interested in the use of cold exposure</p>
<p>for increasing testosterone.</p>
<p>And some of those people in communities</p>
<p>are indeed using cold exposure directly on the gonads,</p>
<p>on the testes in order to do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not certain that that direct contact is necessary.</p>
<p>And in some cases it might actually be quite dangerous</p>
<p>or you at least should be careful</p>
<p>in terms of tissues there and avoiding damage.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I think that a dopamine impact</p>
<p>on testosterone is very likely</p>
<p>given the 250% increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that have been observed with cold water immersion.</p>
<p>And all of that points to the fact</p>
<p>that cold water immersion very likely increases testosterone</p>
<p>but as a downstream consequence</p>
<p>of the cold water immersion effects on dopamine</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s no reason to think</p>
<p>that the increases in luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>would also increase estrogen.</p>
<p>Probably not too dangerous</p>
<p>or levels that one would want to avoid.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>particularly specific about cold for inducing testosterone</p>
<p>and not other hormones.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very likely to increases</p>
<p>a number of different hormones.</p>
<p>I do hope that there will be a systematic study on this</p>
<p>in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>I also hope to not be a subject</p>
<p>in the cooling of the gonads experiment.</p>
<p>Now I promise you the last topic was the last topic</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one other really important point</p>
<p>that I think everyone should be aware of</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to use deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>And that brings us back to the very first thing</p>
<p>that we discussed today</p>
<p>along the lines of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>which is that your baseline temperature</p>
<p>is going to be lowest about two hours before you wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to increase in the morning and as you wake up</p>
<p>and increase throughout the day and afternoon</p>
<p>and then start to drop in the evening</p>
<p>and come down at night as you head to sleep.</p>
<p>I also want you to remember</p>
<p>that if you are to cool the external portion of your body</p>
<p>in particular your torso,</p>
<p>the net effect of that</p>
<p>is going to be an increase in body temperature.</p>
<p>So for many people, not all, but for many people</p>
<p>if you are going to do deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>you are going to increase your core body temperature.</p>
<p>And that makes sense if you think about</p>
<p>how deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism</p>
<p>by increasing thermogenesis.</p>
<p>What that all means is that</p>
<p>if you are doing your deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>early in the day,</p>
<p>you are going to get yet a further increase</p>
<p>in core body temperature</p>
<p>that would be associated with wakefulness,</p>
<p>your ability to be alert that morning</p>
<p>or throughout the day and so on.</p>
<p>It also means that if you do your deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>very late in the evening or at night,</p>
<p>so 6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9 p.m. and so on</p>
<p>you are going to increase your core body temperature.</p>
<p>And if you recall a decrease in core body temperature</p>
<p>of one to three degrees is not just beneficial</p>
<p>but is necessary in order to get into deep sleep</p>
<p>and remain in deep sleep.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from this is</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure done properly</p>
<p>will increase your core body temperature</p>
<p>and make you feel more alert.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing it early in the day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably terrific</p>
<p>given that most of us want to be alert during the day.</p>
<p>However, if you do it too late in the day,</p>
<p>evening or night, it can disrupt sleep</p>
<p>by way of disrupting your core body temperature.</p>
<p>Now, the caveat to that is I myself</p>
<p>tend to do my deliberate cold exposure early in the day,</p>
<p>maybe not first thing in the morning, but mid morning,</p>
<p>maybe as late as three or four in the afternoon</p>
<p>in some cases, in the longer days of summer</p>
<p>I might do it even later, 5 or 6 p.m.</p>
<p>and have no trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>I have done deliberate cold exposure very late at night,</p>
<p>10 p.m., 11 p.m. and so on as part of a 30 day challenge</p>
<p>of doing deliberate cold exposure every day for 30 days.</p>
<p>And I got sloppy with my timing.</p>
<p>And then in order to not miss a day,</p>
<p>I would do it at 11 o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>
<p>And I must say, I found that I could still fall asleep</p>
<p>very easily, even doing deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>very late at night.</p>
<p>However, on those particular days, I was particularly busy.</p>
<p>And so I was particularly exhausted</p>
<p>when I arrived at the deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>and I had no trouble falling asleep</p>
<p>after doing deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>and then taking a nice warm shower and then going to sleep.</p>
<p>But I could imagine that because of the increases</p>
<p>in core body temperature caused by deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>that were one to do that too late in the day,</p>
<p>evening or night, that it could indeed disrupt your sleep.</p>
<p>So my recommendation would be for most people,</p>
<p>only do deliberate cold exposure if you are prepared</p>
<p>to be fairly alert for the next one to four</p>
<p>or maybe even six hours following</p>
<p>that deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So for today&rsquo;s episode, as is the case with most episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I covered a lot of material.</p>
<p>We talked about mechanisms of catecholamines and stress</p>
<p>and pulsatile release of epinephrine, metabolism,</p>
<p>mental effects, performance, glabrous skin cooling</p>
<p>and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And while the goal of course is to make sure</p>
<p>that everyone arrives at specific, very clear mechanistic</p>
<p>and actionable protocols, I do realize that it is</p>
<p>an immense amount of information.</p>
<p>And for that reason, I&rsquo;ve created a list</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure protocols</p>
<p>aimed at improving mental toughness and resilience,</p>
<p>mood, performance, metabolism, reducing inflammation</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>All of those have been condensed into succinct form</p>
<p>and can be found at the Huberman Lab</p>
