    <p>The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>Vitalik is the cofounder of Ethereum</p>
<p>and one of the most influential people</p>
<p>in cryptocurrency and technology broadly defined.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed,</p>
<p>Four Sigmatic, and BetterHelp.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Ethereum, Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and many other cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>have been taking a wild ride of prices going up and down</p>
<p>in the past few months.</p>
<p>To me, the prices were never as important as the ideas,</p>
<p>both technical and philosophical.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency has the potential to empower billions</p>
<p>of people to participate in the global economy</p>
<p>in a way that resists the manipulation</p>
<p>by centralized power.</p>
<p>Also with smart contracts, layer two technologies,</p>
<p>data pools, NFTs, and of course,</p>
<p>integration of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>into the whole thing, we have the opportunity</p>
<p>to build tools and worlds that transform physical</p>
<p>and digital life as we know it,</p>
<p>hopefully minimizing the suffering in the world</p>
<p>and maximizing the fun.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first talk about Shiba Inu, if we can.</p>
<p>Also known as Shiba Token, code SHIB,</p>
<p>for context, Shiba Inu was created in August 2020,</p>
<p>modeled off of Dogecoin by the anonymous founder</p>
<p>known as Ryoshi.</p>
<p>On May 10th this year, it had a market capitalization</p>
<p>of over 13 billion.</p>
<p>And maybe you can explain this, but in a crazy move,</p>
<p>you were given half of SHIB&rsquo;s total supply.</p>
<p>You burned, a.k.a. destroyed 90% of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worth $6.7 billion.</p>
<p>And you donated 10%, that&rsquo;s worth 1.2 billion at the time</p>
<p>to an India COVID 19 relief fund,</p>
<p>saying you don&rsquo;t want to be the locus of this much power.</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>Why and how were you able to walk away</p>
<p>from this much money and this much power?</p>
<p>So I should probably start by giving some of the backstory</p>
<p>around these coins and this concept of giving me coins.</p>
<p>So first of all, Shiba Inu, as you said,</p>
<p>is this kind of knockoff of Dogecoin, right?</p>
<p>And Dogecoin was this initial kind of fun coin</p>
<p>that was created back, I think, around 2014 or so.</p>
<p>And it was just created by Jackson Palmer</p>
<p>who put it out as a joke for a couple of hours</p>
<p>and a community formed around it.</p>
<p>And at the beginning, people didn&rsquo;t take it very seriously.</p>
<p>I actually remember putting about $25,000 into Doge</p>
<p>sometime around 2016.</p>
<p>And I just remember thinking to myself,</p>
<p>okay, how am I going to explain to my mom</p>
<p>that I just invested $25,000 into Dogecoins?</p>
<p>And what even are Dogecoins?</p>
<p>The only interesting thing about this coin</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a logo of a dog somewhere.</p>
<p>But of course, that ended up being one of the best</p>
<p>investments I&rsquo;ve ever made and it did really well.</p>
<p>And then at the end of 2020, Elon Musk, of course,</p>
<p>started talking about Dogecoin and the market cap</p>
<p>just shot up to about $50 billion.</p>
<p>Actually, it shot up multiple times, right?</p>
<p>Like the first time it went up from about 0.8 cents</p>
<p>to about like 7 cents.</p>
<p>And this just happened all in one day.</p>
<p>And I remember this was when I was still in Singapore</p>
<p>in the middle of COVID and I saw that the price</p>
<p>just went up by 1000% and I was like,</p>
<p>oh my God, my Doge is worth like a lot.</p>
<p>And so I immediately called up some of my friends</p>
<p>and told them to like drop everything and scramble.</p>
<p>And I sold half the Doge and I got $4.3 million,</p>
<p>donated the proceeds to give directly.</p>
<p>And a few hours after I did this,</p>
<p>the price dropped back down from about 7 cents to 4 cents.</p>
<p>So I managed to sell the Doge at the top</p>
<p>and I remember just that feeling</p>
<p>like I was such an amazing trader.</p>
<p>But then of course, the price went up from 4 cents</p>
<p>then to 7 and then 50 and just like Doge becoming</p>
<p>this big phenomenon where there&rsquo;s even a lot of people</p>
<p>that have heard of Doge that have not heard of Ethereum</p>
<p>is just like something even I wasn&rsquo;t predicting, right?</p>
<p>And so after that, of course, we have Doge</p>
<p>and then people are thinking, well,</p>
<p>if the leading DOG token is worth $50 billion,</p>
<p>then surely the second largest DOG token deserves</p>
<p>at least seven or 8 billion, right?</p>
<p>Like, I feel like that&rsquo;s the kind of what the mindset</p>
<p>of these Shiba people is.</p>
<p>So that of course, they did this other gimmick, right?</p>
<p>Where they gave me half the Shiba token supply.</p>
<p>They were actually not the first projects to do this.</p>
<p>So around the end of 2020,</p>
<p>there was this weird project called Teller.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like T E L L O R.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re a chain link competitor</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>But I remember they just like dumped $50,000</p>
<p>worth of their token into my wallet.</p>
<p>And then they had their Twitter army</p>
<p>just like basically run around saying,</p>
<p>look, look at Vitalik&rsquo;s wallet, Vitalik holds Tellers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of us, he&rsquo;s a supporter.</p>
<p>And as soon as I discovered this,</p>
<p>I just like publicly sold the Teller tokens on Uniswap.</p>
<p>And this created a bit of a Twitter splat.</p>
<p>Now, the Shiba people were more clever.</p>
<p>The Shiba people, instead of dumping to that wallet,</p>
<p>they dumped to my cold wallet, right?</p>
<p>So in a cryptocurrency, right,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this concept of like cold wallets and hot wallets.</p>
<p>Basically, like the thing that actually owns your money</p>
<p>is like this 80 digit number called a private key, right?</p>
<p>And a hot wallet is when that private key</p>
<p>is just stored in memory on your computer,</p>
<p>on your phone, really easy to access.</p>
<p>Cold wallet means it&rsquo;s either written down</p>
<p>on a piece of paper or it&rsquo;s on a computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just never accessed the internet, right?</p>
<p>So cold is very inconvenient,</p>
<p>but cold is also much more secure, right?</p>
<p>Because even if that computer has some viruses on it,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like air gapped,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not actually going to be able to upload it.</p>
<p>So this cold wallet and like all the money</p>
<p>is out of the cold wallet,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s safe for me to talk about my setup now, right?</p>
<p>But it was a laptop that was sitting in Canada.</p>
<p>And I also had two pieces of paper</p>
<p>where I wrote down two numbers</p>
<p>on those two pieces of paper.</p>
<p>One was with me, one was in Canada.</p>
<p>And if you add those two numbers together,</p>
<p>you get the private key.</p>
<p>So because of COVID travel restrictions,</p>
<p>and this cold wallets in Canada,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very difficult for me to actually access it, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if they knew this,</p>
<p>maybe they just got lucky,</p>
<p>but basically they sent a lot of these dog tokens</p>
<p>into this wallet where it was very difficult</p>
<p>for me to access it.</p>
<p>But then I saw these dog tokens,</p>
<p>I saw more and more people talking about them.</p>
<p>And then at some point I realized that like,</p>
<p>hey, these things are worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And like, no, there&rsquo;s lots of really good things</p>
<p>that you could do with that amount of money.</p>
<p>And it would actually be a waste to just like see it go.</p>
<p>So I made the decision that like,</p>
<p>I would actually power through</p>
<p>and figure out how to like safely,</p>
<p>like basically get my private key.</p>
<p>I actually had to call up my family,</p>
<p>tell them to read out their number</p>
<p>off of their piece of paper.</p>
<p>I entered that into a fresh laptop</p>
<p>that I bought from Target.</p>
<p>Then I put in my other number on my piece of paper,</p>
<p>added the two numbers together on the computer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>And at the same time, like just scrambled for two days,</p>
<p>setting up a new wallet</p>
<p>where I could move my ETH to safely,</p>
<p>like getting people to be multisig partners,</p>
<p>just like doing all sorts of like stuff</p>
<p>that 10 years ago you would expect</p>
<p>to just be part of a cyberpunk science fiction novel,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s all real.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing this all by yourself, essentially.</p>
<p>Most of it by myself.</p>
<p>So you have to keep it secret.</p>
<p>Right, and I needed my family to actually like go</p>
<p>and read the number on their piece of paper.</p>
<p>And then in my new multisig wallet,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s other people that are signatories,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m obviously not gonna reveal any details beyond that.</p>
<p>So I did this, right?</p>
<p>And I actually managed to like get the private key,</p>
<p>make the first transaction that would just move all my ETH</p>
<p>to the multisig wallet so it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>And then second transact,</p>
<p>put the private key on my main computer,</p>
<p>then started going in and just selling some</p>
<p>of the dog tokens and then just like giving them</p>
<p>to these different charities.</p>
<p>Now, at the time I actually did not even like have any idea</p>
<p>of how much you would be able to get, right?</p>
<p>Because like on paper, the dog tokens are $7 billion,</p>
<p>but like in reality, it&rsquo;s a very liquid market.</p>
<p>Are you gonna crash it after you sell 1 million worth</p>
<p>or are you gonna crash it after 10 million?</p>
<p>Might you actually be able to get like an entire 200 million?</p>
<p>I had no idea.</p>
<p>So I definitely was just over the mindset,</p>
<p>like, okay, I mean, I&rsquo;ll sell a bit,</p>
<p>maybe I get some ETH and then donated some ETH</p>
<p>to give well, donated some to other groups.</p>
<p>And then, okay, have some dog tokens.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have an easy ability to sell more myself,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;ll just like give them to these groups</p>
<p>and like, hopefully they&rsquo;ll do good things with them.</p>
<p>It was actually, I actually donated at 20%</p>
<p>then dumped 80%.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the COVID India group got one batch</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another group that got another batch.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna say who they are</p>
<p>cause I think that they wanna announce themselves</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can see the fact</p>
<p>that these transactions were made on the blockchain,</p>
<p>but it was just very interesting and unexpected</p>
<p>and just an insanely crazy situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for helping me hang up some curtains.</p>
<p>This is a first for the podcast</p>
<p>and shows that you&rsquo;re a truly a special person</p>
<p>to be willing to help.</p>
<p>But now a couple of weeks later,</p>
<p>do you regret any aspect of that decision?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there is some things</p>
<p>that I probably could have done better.</p>
<p>Like I was actually talking to some of these charities</p>
<p>and I was impressed by just how much money they managed</p>
<p>to get out of selling some of these coins.</p>
<p>So I probably could have done better</p>
<p>by just talking more with the traders</p>
<p>and actually ensuring that they can do a better job</p>
<p>of maximizing the value of all of them.</p>
<p>But it was a very stressful time</p>
<p>and I did have to act quickly.</p>
<p>Like I did manage to make a lot of the donations</p>
<p>before, a few days before the great crypto crash happened.</p>
<p>So it was, it&rsquo;s difficult to,</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s parallel universes in which I did better,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also lots of parallel universes</p>
<p>where because I hesitated more</p>
<p>and tried to spend more time thinking I missed</p>
<p>the opportunity.</p>
<p>So on that, it&rsquo;s like a luck of the draw</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just happy that everything was able to turn out</p>
<p>as well as it did.</p>
<p>But psychologically, you mentioned stress.</p>
<p>How hard was it?</p>
<p>It was stressful, right?</p>
<p>I think, well, one of the really stressful parts</p>
<p>was just the fact that I had to basically move</p>
<p>all of my funds, including the 325,000 ether</p>
<p>from one cold wallet into another hot wallet,</p>
<p>or sorry, into another multi SIG wallet.</p>
<p>And maybe the multi SIG wallet had a bug in it.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s like some mistake I&rsquo;ll make in the middle</p>
<p>that causes the funds to get lost.</p>
<p>You know, that part was stressful.</p>
<p>And I was definitely stressing out for two days.</p>
<p>I mean, triple checking the new wallet.</p>
<p>I even did a bit of an audit of the code myself.</p>
<p>I wrote my own JavaScript to DAP to make confirmations</p>
<p>because Gnosis Safe didn&rsquo;t work with the status wallet well.</p>
<p>So there was definitely,</p>
<p>that whole thing was definitely a bit of a marathon.</p>
<p>I was also a kind of definitely a bit worried</p>
<p>about or uncertain, I guess, how the public</p>
<p>and including the coin communities</p>
<p>would perceive the whole thing.</p>
<p>But I was actually impressed.</p>
<p>Like I, for every poster that was saying like,</p>
<p>no, you know, why did Vitalik like rug pull on us?</p>
<p>He was, his wallet was supposed to be a burn address.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like 10 people that are like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I thought I was just in this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a fun pyramid gambling thing.</p>
<p>But instead I ended up being part of this, you know,</p>
<p>great public good thing for humanity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like even more amazing.</p>
<p>So the amounts of that that I got was very impressive.</p>
<p>So, you know, all in all, you know,</p>
<p>I think the dog people did great.</p>
<p>The dog people.</p>
<p>Is there something you can extend</p>
<p>to the bigger picture of it</p>
<p>in the principles you apply to making this decision?</p>
<p>Is there some principles, philosophies</p>
<p>that you apply also to the decisions you make</p>
<p>around Ethereum?</p>
<p>I think a big one for me is just this idea</p>
<p>that crypto, you know, isn&rsquo;t just an opportunity</p>
<p>to give people like slightly better ways</p>
<p>to save value in all of these things.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s also an opportunity to like basically create</p>
<p>these like new digital institutions</p>
<p>that could serve the public good in new ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve been interested in</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>I actually even have this article in Bitcoin Magazine</p>
<p>back in 2014, where I basically suggested this idea</p>
<p>that, you know, you would have coins that represent causes</p>
<p>and like people would just like buy and accept those coins</p>
<p>because they support those causes.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s called markets, institutions, and currencies,</p>
<p>a new form of social incentivization or something like that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you can find it and throw it in the links.</p>
<p>So that was interesting to kind of see becoming real.</p>
<p>And like in general, I think, you know,</p>
<p>public goods are very important</p>
<p>and on the internet, public goods are even more important.</p>
<p>Like every single Lex Friedman podcast is just on YouTube</p>
<p>and no anyone can go and see it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no way for you to like, you know, sell it</p>
<p>and so that some people can see it,</p>
<p>but then other people can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you could do that,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;d obviously be reducing your impact.</p>
<p>So thank you for making the amazing Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>so freely available.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually a tense thing is how do you do it</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not controlled in a centralized fashion?</p>
<p>Cause actually YouTube feels free and open,</p>
<p>but it nevertheless is one company</p>
<p>making centralized decisions.</p>
<p>And the first time I realized YouTube is not forever</p>
<p>is when a lot of the Joe Rogan experience library</p>
<p>was pulled from YouTube as part of the Spotify deal.</p>
<p>And it made me realize we need to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the realization that fiat money is centralized</p>
<p>is realizing that, you know, this is not forever</p>
<p>and you might want to come up with schemes to distribute it,</p>
<p>to decentralize the control of it</p>
<p>in a way that audio for podcasts is just an RSS feed.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I think one of the kind of philosophical things</p>
<p>that I hope to achieve is kind of decouple</p>
<p>the concept of public goods,</p>
<p>which are incredibly important</p>
<p>and are the lifeblood of modern civilization</p>
<p>from the idea that there is or can be</p>
<p>one central organization that represents the public</p>
<p>and like perfectly understands and can impose their idea</p>
<p>of what is the good, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, when people talk about public goods,</p>
<p>it just often comes with this baggage of, you know,</p>
<p>either centralization or conformism.</p>
<p>And I think like it doesn&rsquo;t have to, right?</p>
<p>Like often the most important public goods</p>
<p>are the ones that are created by, you know,</p>
<p>the crazy individualists that disagree with everyone else.</p>
<p>So trying to make this kind of synthesis</p>
<p>where you combine the values of decentralization</p>
<p>and the values of open source,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not naive about it.</p>
<p>And like, you know, you realize that</p>
<p>for these things to be produced,</p>
<p>there needs to be a way for it to be sustainable.</p>
<p>There needs to be some way of supporting people</p>
<p>who are working these projects.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>you want to avoid that turning into</p>
<p>a vector of centralization,</p>
<p>like trying to sort of get all of the good things</p>
<p>without the bad things.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s a big part of sort of</p>
<p>what my grand experiment in crypto is about.</p>
<p>And like, we are doing things</p>
<p>in different kinds of things for this, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s the Gitcoin Grants quadratic funding</p>
<p>in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously these dog coins</p>
<p>that just happens, I guess, accidentally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other projects that, like for example,</p>
<p>you know, Uniswap has their Uniswap DAO</p>
<p>that just has a huge amount of funding.</p>
<p>And like, we haven&rsquo;t seen yet how that&rsquo;s going to be deployed,</p>
<p>but, you know, it could be potentially deployed</p>
<p>to do lots of really good and amazing things.</p>
<p>Do you see Ethereum as essentially a mechanism</p>
<p>to fight for social causes?</p>
<p>I definitely see Ethereum as being a mechanism</p>
<p>to fight for definitely some specific things</p>
<p>that are social causes.</p>
<p>Like just, you know,</p>
<p>the fact of creating an open financial system</p>
<p>that anyone can participate in</p>
<p>no matter where they are in the world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a social cause.</p>
<p>Just, you know, giving people the ability</p>
<p>to organize and create projects,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s five people in five different countries.</p>
<p>I think that kind of inclusiveness,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a social cause</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a core crypto value.</p>
<p>But then at the same time, like the other important</p>
<p>and if part of the magic of Ethereum</p>
<p>that you have to balance that against</p>
<p>is that it is also this open platform</p>
<p>where ultimately, you know,</p>
<p>the things that are on Ethereum</p>
<p>is just the things that the community makes of it.</p>
<p>Well, you kind of briefly opened the door,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>When it comes to government regulation of crypto,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best case scenario?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the worst case scenario?</p>
<p>In terms of, you know, as you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned,</p>
<p>Ethereum challenges the power centers of the world</p>
<p>and how do you see the interplay between governments</p>
<p>and this new technology that resists centralized power?</p>
<p>Best case and worst case.</p>
<p>The best case is that, you know,</p>
<p>blockchains continue to prosper</p>
<p>and we figure out scalability</p>
<p>so that people can actually start doing things on block,</p>
<p>like, you know, all of the amazing use cases</p>
<p>that people have been talking about</p>
<p>instead of today where a lot of the great stuff</p>
<p>gets priced out because, you know,</p>
<p>transaction fees are at five to $10</p>
<p>and then we see a lot of different amazing applications</p>
<p>happening on blockchains.</p>
<p>You know, it could be like DAO is creating new ways</p>
<p>for people to interact and organize with each other</p>
<p>and new ways for artists to get funded</p>
<p>and just all sorts of these amazing things</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just enough public support</p>
<p>and just enough people that see that, you know,</p>
<p>look, crypto is clearly doing a lot of good things</p>
<p>and, you know, there are definitely areas</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s tensions,</p>
<p>but in those areas where there&rsquo;s tensions,</p>
<p>like, there could be some kind of creative</p>
<p>and interesting approaches that get figured out, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, the concept of corporate taxes,</p>
<p>for example, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, that would disappear as a revenue stream</p>
<p>if theoretically corporations just all get replaced by DAOs</p>
<p>but, you know, like maybe there&rsquo;s some other creative way</p>
<p>by which DAOs themselves can kind of be code,</p>
<p>you know, have some kind of encoded governance</p>
<p>that ensures that they have at least some kind of bias</p>
<p>towards serving the global public good</p>
<p>and, you know, maybe DAOs can do enough of that</p>
<p>that people are happy with it.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are going to be things</p>
<p>that people are unhappy about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gonna be the people</p>
<p>that, you know, wants to surveil everyone</p>
<p>but if the kind of effect of crypto</p>
<p>from just empowering people is greater than that</p>
<p>and greater than that in a way</p>
<p>that people can just easily see,</p>
<p>then, you know, that would be a good scenario, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll just become kind of incorporated and accepted</p>
<p>the same way as happened with the internet.</p>
<p>But in the worst case scenario would, of course,</p>
<p>be just like people suddenly, you know,</p>
<p>flipping and going into moral panic mode</p>
<p>and just, you know, oh my God,</p>
<p>like this technology is used by like, you know,</p>
<p>insert bad group over the day.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t think governments have the ability</p>
<p>to ban crypto to the extent of just complete</p>
<p>like preventing blockchains from existing</p>
<p>but they definitely have the ability</p>
<p>to really marginalize it, right?</p>
<p>Like if you just ban all exchanges,</p>
<p>like in ban all links from the Fiat ecosystem to crypto</p>
<p>and, you know, you ban all kind of mainstream employers</p>
<p>from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>then like you can successfully like turn it into a,</p>
<p>like, you know, a fairly kind of niche countercultural thing</p>
<p>that has much less impact than otherwise would.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s somewhere between the good scenario</p>
<p>and the bad scenario.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously hoping for the good.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting also the tension</p>
<p>between governments and companies.</p>
<p>Like if you have a bunch of billionaires</p>
<p>or a bunch of companies like Tesla investing in Bitcoin</p>
<p>and then governments resisting that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting who wins out in that worst case scenario.</p>
<p>And almost when companies and rich, quote unquote,</p>
<p>respectable people embrace cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, so on, even the dot coins,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost sends a signal to everybody else</p>
<p>that this is a revolution that&rsquo;s here to stay.</p>
<p>On this one little tangent that you brought up,</p>
<p>this is almost an outdated idea, but it&rsquo;s still with us,</p>
<p>which is cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activity,</p>
<p>for drugs, for crime, and so on.</p>
<p>Is there some sense that worries you</p>
<p>that if cryptocurrency, if Ethereum runs the world,</p>
<p>then making money from crime will be easier?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always that possibility, but like at the same time,</p>
<p>I think if you look at, you know, the world as a whole</p>
<p>and like the way all the other technological trends</p>
<p>are going, like, you know, in person surveillance</p>
<p>is just going up every year, right?</p>
<p>Like if you commit a crime in, you know, meat space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to get away with it.</p>
<p>So like, you know, if you wants to do something,</p>
<p>and this is something that&rsquo;s just like happening</p>
<p>as a result of, you know, just better technology</p>
<p>and information transparency,</p>
<p>like a lot of it&rsquo;s hard to prevent even if you really tried.</p>
<p>So the world where like things go dark to such an extent,</p>
<p>you know, as the police hawks sometimes like to say,</p>
<p>to such an extent that like, you know, oh my God,</p>
<p>the criminals are committing crimes with impunity</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t see anything, like that just seems unlikely.</p>
<p>But, you know, on the other hand,</p>
<p>like the world where there just, you know,</p>
<p>is no privacy, for example, or the world where there just</p>
<p>like is no ability to kind of act outside of the confines</p>
<p>of, you know, mainstream institutions,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s more realistic</p>
<p>and that seems like something that could lead</p>
<p>to a lot of kind of a lot of scary things, right?</p>
<p>And like, even from a government&rsquo;s point of view, right?</p>
<p>Like I think governments over the last few years,</p>
<p>a lot of them, they&rsquo;re very worried about sovereignty.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re worried about like,</p>
<p>if their country is economies and, you know,</p>
<p>social environments are just completely dependent</p>
<p>on basically foreign tech companies controlled</p>
<p>by foreign governments, like, you know,</p>
<p>governments are not on team government, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, the Indian government is on,</p>
<p>you know, team India, then the Russian government</p>
<p>is on team Russia and so forth, right?</p>
<p>So like, you know, they don&rsquo;t want the US to be able</p>
<p>to like have this big backdoor into everything.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I do think that a balance is needed,</p>
<p>but at the same time, I do think,</p>
<p>I guess I definitely like worry more</p>
<p>about the possibility that just like without things</p>
<p>to like crypto kind of acting outside of institutions</p>
<p>becomes too impossible.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even necessarily mean outside of governments,</p>
<p>even just, you know, outside of corporations,</p>
<p>like becomes too impossible.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just like terrible things</p>
<p>that come as a result.</p>
<p>I mean, if things going in the other direction,</p>
<p>like it obviously is a risk, but no,</p>
<p>at the same time, I think in the longterm,</p>
<p>like a crypto can potentially even like offer defenses</p>
<p>as much as attacks against that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, many throughout history,</p>
<p>many of the most destructive things came</p>
<p>from centralized institutions versus sort of</p>
<p>from the people operating in the shadows.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve been talking to a bunch</p>
<p>of psychedelics folks that people doing researches</p>
<p>like Rick Doblin in Johns Hopkins,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of exciting research on psychedelics.</p>
<p>And one thing you could say about operating</p>
<p>at the edge of legality,</p>
<p>it could actually accelerate the adoption</p>
<p>of particular things like whether it&rsquo;s marijuana</p>
<p>or psychedelics, they can help people out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost accelerates the policy.</p>
<p>It forces the policy to catch up</p>
<p>to where the people stand.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a positive way of doing things</p>
<p>that are in the gray area of legality</p>
<p>and creating a market that allows people</p>
<p>to in a safe way be able to participate</p>
<p>in this gray area of legality.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind, of course,</p>
<p>is that the set of like the kinds of things</p>
<p>that just like payment processors as companies</p>
<p>try to restrict you from is much larger</p>
<p>than the set of things that&rsquo;s illegal, right?</p>
<p>Like part of that is because they wanna be</p>
<p>super conservative and like the more layers you have,</p>
<p>the more they&rsquo;re like conservative</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re scared of what the layer below them</p>
<p>will do to them.</p>
<p>Sometimes they have their own moral opinions</p>
<p>of various kinds.</p>
<p>They go after lots of people, right?</p>
<p>Like they make life really hard for sex workers,</p>
<p>for example, psychedelics, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of activity,</p>
<p>even including stuff that is totally legal</p>
<p>that just there&rsquo;s this like shadow</p>
<p>like PayPal credit card governments</p>
<p>or whatever you wanna call it.</p>
<p>And that makes it just hard to participate in this stuff.</p>
<p>So I think like reducing the number of intermediaries</p>
<p>is definitely normally a good thing.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s talk about one of the most exciting</p>
<p>technologies like technically, philosophically,</p>
<p>like socially, financially in every way,</p>
<p>which is Ethereum 2.0.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million things to talk about,</p>
<p>but step one is probably a good thing to do,</p>
<p>which is can you briefly summarize your vision</p>
<p>how Ethereum 2.0 will make Ethereum more scalable,</p>
<p>secure and sustainable?</p>
<p>Sure, so I think recently we&rsquo;ve actually been</p>
<p>kind of deemphasizing the ETH 2.0 branding, I guess.</p>
<p>So the reason behind that was that originally</p>
<p>we envisioned something more like a big grand event</p>
<p>where all the good things would happen at the same time</p>
<p>and it would be a new blockchain,</p>
<p>and it would be a new protocol</p>
<p>and people would have to take a lot of effort</p>
<p>to migrate over.</p>
<p>But later we&rsquo;ve slowly changed the roadmap</p>
<p>over to something that&rsquo;s much more incremental, right?</p>
<p>So proof of stake happens kind of over time</p>
<p>and then sharding gets added over time</p>
<p>and all of these features get added over time.</p>
<p>And so the experience for just a regular Ethereum user</p>
<p>still feels very seamless, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like maybe a little bit more complex</p>
<p>than the hard forks that we&rsquo;ve already done</p>
<p>from a user&rsquo;s point of view, but not by that much, right?</p>
<p>So the big two things that are happening, right?</p>
<p>These are what used to be considered</p>
<p>the two flagship features of ETH 2.0</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re just the flagship features</p>
<p>of the next devolution of Ethereum,</p>
<p>as proof of stake and sharding.</p>
<p>So proof of stake is a consensus algorithm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, or a consensus mechanism, I should say.</p>
<p>The difference is that like an algorithm</p>
<p>is something that you run by yourself.</p>
<p>A mechanism is like interactions between people</p>
<p>and it could even include incentives and all of that.</p>
<p>So a consensus mechanism,</p>
<p>so by which nodes in the network agree on</p>
<p>which blocks came in, which transactions came in,</p>
<p>what order, make sure that once a block gets accepted,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t get reverted and all of these things</p>
<p>that we expect from a blockchain.</p>
<p>So existing blockchains, including Bitcoin,</p>
<p>including the Ethereum of today,</p>
<p>and including a lot of them, they use proof of work, right?</p>
<p>So the reason why we need proof of anything</p>
<p>is because they serve this function that I call</p>
<p>an economic civil resistance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s obviously a big word for,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;ve never heard of symbols before,</p>
<p>but like the basic idea is, right,</p>
<p>that you have a network and you have lots of computers</p>
<p>that agree on like which blocks to accept.</p>
<p>And sometimes you get two blocks that get published</p>
<p>at the same time and you just have to agree on an order.</p>
<p>So there has to be some kind of voting game.</p>
<p>But then the question is, well, in this voting game,</p>
<p>who gets to vote, who gets to participate?</p>
<p>Now, you can&rsquo;t say one person, one vote, right?</p>
<p>The reason why you cannot say one person, one vote</p>
<p>is because you need some kind of like authority</p>
<p>or some kind of mechanism to say who the humans are.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>then a bad guy could just come in with a virtual machine</p>
<p>or with a computer that has on it 10 billion virtual machines</p>
<p>that have 10 billion virtual nodes.</p>
<p>And then just like say, look, I&rsquo;m 99% of the network,</p>
<p>I should control everything.</p>
<p>So to prevent this, what proof of work and proof of stake</p>
<p>both do is they basically say, well, the weight of your vote,</p>
<p>like how much influence your votes have in the consensus</p>
<p>is proportional to like what quantity</p>
<p>of economic resources you bring in.</p>
<p>So in the case of proof of work,</p>
<p>you prove what economic resources you have</p>
<p>because your economic resources are computers</p>
<p>and you prove that you have them</p>
<p>by just running them 24 seven</p>
<p>using these hash algorithms, right?</p>
<p>So this does solve the problem, right?</p>
<p>Because in order to attack the network,</p>
<p>you have to come in with more computers</p>
<p>and more money invested into computers and electricity</p>
<p>than the rest of the network puts together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s extremely expensive.</p>
<p>In proof of stake, instead of relying on people</p>
<p>with computers that are just constantly cranking out</p>
<p>hashes 24 seven, as you&rsquo;re like a unit of economic resources,</p>
<p>you just use like holdings of coins inside the system, right?</p>
<p>So all of these blockchains,</p>
<p>they have some kind of coin in them.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has Bitcoin, Ethereum has ether,</p>
<p>they all have a coin.</p>
<p>So why not just use that as the economic resource</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using to measure participation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the core distinction</p>
<p>between proof of work and proof of stake.</p>
<p>I like proof of stake</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve liked proof of stake for many years,</p>
<p>basically because like it just requires</p>
<p>much less ongoing resource consumption, right?</p>
<p>Like with proof of work,</p>
<p>you have to like actually go and buy these physical computers</p>
<p>and these days, they have specialized hardware,</p>
<p>ASICs, application specific integrated circuits.</p>
<p>You have to go produce them and you have to go buy them.</p>
<p>And unless you have millions of dollars,</p>
<p>you have to buy them from one of these other people</p>
<p>who creates them and those other people often end up</p>
<p>taking a huge cut of the profits themselves.</p>
<p>And then you have to plug them in,</p>
<p>you have to just burn all of this electricity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just running 24 seven.</p>
<p>So it consumes a huge amount of energy, right?</p>
<p>And not just energy, it also,</p>
<p>just to create the hardware, right?</p>
<p>Like people focus a lot on energy,</p>
<p>but like actually about half the cost of proof of work</p>
<p>mining is the cost of the hardware.</p>
<p>So hardware is a very big deal too.</p>
<p>And you need this really big and powerful,</p>
<p>very specialized hardware,</p>
<p>another kind that fills up these big warehouses.</p>
<p>So proof of stake,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really need that much electricity,</p>
<p>you just need just a little bit to run a regular computer.</p>
<p>You can run proof of stake validators on computers</p>
<p>that you already have.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just much less resource intensive.</p>
<p>And like, this is good for a few reasons, right?</p>
<p>Like one is, you know,</p>
<p>the kind of environmental rationale that, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not breaking the environment.</p>
<p>The second is that you&rsquo;re not taking away electricity</p>
<p>and like other resources from other people.</p>
<p>I mean, like right now there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think just today I saw a story about like Iran</p>
<p>wanting to shut down some Bitcoin mining</p>
<p>because it was just grabbing up so much electricity</p>
<p>that it was, you know, outbidding the nearby towns</p>
<p>and they just didn&rsquo;t have enough.</p>
<p>And then there was like Chia,</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s doing proof of like hard disk mining</p>
<p>basically is just like grabbing up so many hard disks,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a shortage, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the second reason.</p>
<p>And then the third more selfish reason is that</p>
<p>because participating in consensus</p>
<p>does not require so much energy expenditure,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to pay people as much to participate, right?</p>
<p>So like Bitcoin and Ethereum,</p>
<p>they both issue somewhere around 4% of the total supply</p>
<p>every year right now to miners.</p>
<p>So Ethereum is about 4.7 million ether</p>
<p>and the current supply is about 115 million.</p>
<p>But with proof of stake,</p>
<p>like we expect it&rsquo;ll be somewhere between 500,000</p>
<p>and one million per year.</p>
<p>So that means, you know,</p>
<p>the supply doesn&rsquo;t have to increase so quickly.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>One of the pros that the people sort of argue for the proof</p>
<p>of work is that it is secure</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s much more difficult to sort of,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve highlighted, it&rsquo;s difficult to participate.</p>
<p>Is there, what are your thoughts about the security</p>
<p>of the proof of stake mechanism?</p>
<p>Is there ways to make it secure?</p>
<p>So I think proof of stake is very secure</p>
<p>because in order to be able to attack the system,</p>
<p>you needs to have like basically as much stake</p>
<p>as the rest of the network, right?</p>
<p>So that means like right now, for example,</p>
<p>we have 5 million eth staking.</p>
<p>So you have to come up with 5 million eth</p>
<p>and then join the network.</p>
<p>And then the other, so 5 million eth is a lot, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how much is it now?</p>
<p>Like $15 billion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually more than I believe the cost</p>
<p>of attacking the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>And then the second thing is that recovering</p>
<p>from attacks is much easier in proof of stake</p>
<p>than in proof of work, right?</p>
<p>Because in proof of stake, you have, like, first of all,</p>
<p>we have for many kinds of attacks</p>
<p>that you do against this network,</p>
<p>we have this concept of like automatic slashing, right?</p>
<p>Which basically means that in order</p>
<p>to like revert a finalized block,</p>
<p>so if there&rsquo;s one block that&rsquo;s like accepted by the network</p>
<p>and you try to convince the network</p>
<p>to kind of revert that block and accept a different block,</p>
<p>in order to make that kind of attack,</p>
<p>you basically have to have your validator,</p>
<p>like a big portion of your validator</p>
<p>assigned to conflicting messages.</p>
<p>And this is something that like once these messages</p>
<p>are on the network, like you can go and prove,</p>
<p>like, look, these people did it.</p>
<p>And so we have this feature in the protocol called slashing</p>
<p>where you basically take all these people</p>
<p>who provably misbehaved and you burn their coins, right?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t burn anyone else&rsquo;s coins.</p>
<p>Now, there are other cases, like for example,</p>
<p>if instead of reverting blocks,</p>
<p>the attack just tries to censor everyone, right?</p>
<p>Then everyone who got censored would just like</p>
<p>basically create the minority chain</p>
<p>and then the community would basically</p>
<p>have to do a soft fork, right?</p>
<p>They would just have to say like,</p>
<p>look, this chain is clearly attacking us,</p>
<p>this chain is the one not attacking us,</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re gonna join this chain.</p>
<p>And then what happens is that on that new chain,</p>
<p>the attackers also lose a lot of coins, right?</p>
<p>So the difference between proof of stake and proof of work</p>
<p>is that in a proof of stake system,</p>
<p>like you can identify specific participants</p>
<p>and you can say, you know, these,</p>
<p>and like this isn&rsquo;t like, you know,</p>
<p>a human going in and saying, I don&rsquo;t like you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like you, I don&rsquo;t like you,</p>
<p>this is like automated, right?</p>
<p>So the slashing process is automated.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there ways it can go wrong?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a painful process where the coins are burned.</p>
<p>It is painful, yes.</p>
<p>I think, I mean, the one big unknown, of course,</p>
<p>is like if an attack actually happens</p>
<p>and like if an attack happens that requires the community</p>
<p>to actually choose one of these minority forks,</p>
<p>then like what would the community</p>
<p>actually successfully coordinating on this look like, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like, you know, we can talk about it</p>
<p>and we can, you know, write like science fiction novels</p>
<p>about it, but like until it&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really know the details of like what it looks like</p>
<p>and how difficult it is.</p>
<p>What are the channels of communication for the community?</p>
<p>If you can enlighten me a little bit, like what, you know,</p>
<p>in many ways in the political realm,</p>
<p>Twitter is often used as a way to kind of have</p>
<p>these emerging phenomena of large groups of people</p>
<p>coming to a consensus about a particular idea.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s battle for consensus.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the Ethereum community, how do people,</p>
<p>what are the sources of natural language based communication</p>
<p>that have an emergent belief structure that you would say?</p>
<p>Or is it all through money?</p>
<p>Is it all through trading that the communication happens?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely talking as well.</p>
<p>I mean, like we have to agree on protocol changes somehow,</p>
<p>right, like there&rsquo;s Twitter, there&rsquo;s Reddit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s GitHub, there&rsquo;s all of the various Ethereum forums,</p>
<p>Ethereum magicians, Ethereum research.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just in person communication.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s just kind of like the hidden web</p>
<p>of everyone talking to everyone on Telegram or Signal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like some of everything, right?</p>
<p>But I think like the thing to emphasize around like,</p>
<p>can you actually come to consensus on, you know,</p>
<p>whether or not to fork the chain</p>
<p>because the attacker is censoring everyone,</p>
<p>just for example, is like everyone who&rsquo;s running a node</p>
<p>is going to see almost the same thing, right?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re gonna be off by a few seconds</p>
<p>and like maybe they&rsquo;ll be off by a few minutes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll disagree by a few minutes.</p>
<p>But like if it&rsquo;s a serious attack, you know,</p>
<p>people are gonna know, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like one of those things where, you know,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re trying to agree on like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>did Epstein kill himself or like some random political fact</p>
<p>where like in reality, no one knows a single thing</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s actually going on and they&rsquo;re all speculating.</p>
<p>Like it is much more visible, right?</p>
<p>So we do have that, but you know, at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to admit that like,</p>
<p>these are fairly untested mechanisms,</p>
<p>but like at the same time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also untested mechanisms in Proof of Work, right?</p>
<p>And like in Proof of Work, it&rsquo;s even harder</p>
<p>because in Proof of Work, you don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to like identify and say, like, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to these miners attacked</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re not gonna let these miners in,</p>
<p>these miners did not attack, so we&rsquo;re gonna keep them in.</p>
<p>Like you have to pretty much, you know,</p>
<p>either take out none of the miners</p>
<p>or you do a fork that changes the Proof of Work algorithm</p>
<p>which takes out all of the miners, right?</p>
<p>So the economics of like recovering from attacks</p>
<p>in Proof of Work, at least to me,</p>
<p>actually do seem like more unfavorable,</p>
<p>but you know, I&rsquo;m sure the Proof of Work people you talk to</p>
<p>will give a very different and contradictory opinions</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s totally fine and amazing.</p>
<p>Some people describe MEV, minor extractable value,</p>
<p>as an existential risk to Ethereum.</p>
<p>What is MEV?</p>
<p>How important is it to solve MEV?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s important, what ideas do you have?</p>
<p>Sure, how about after this one,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll also talk about sharding because it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s part of you too.</p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;ll return back to sharding</p>
<p>which is, we&rsquo;ll return to the big picture</p>
<p>of the scaling problem as you mentioned.</p>
<p>I love this conversation, you know,</p>
<p>depth first search instead of breadth first.</p>
<p>So basically, okay, MEV, minor extractable value,</p>
<p>it is not different in Proof of Work and Proof of Stake,</p>
<p>right, so like if you want to call it, you know,</p>
<p>block proposer extractable value,</p>
<p>like it sounds a lot sexy, but you know,</p>
<p>we can call it BPEV instead of MEV, who cares?</p>
<p>So this is a problem in both Proof of Work</p>
<p>and Proof of Stake?</p>
<p>Yes, so the basic idea is that if you have the ability</p>
<p>to choose which transactions go into a block</p>
<p>and in what order, then you have the ability</p>
<p>to like take advantage of that position for economic gain</p>
<p>and for economic gain in a lot more ways</p>
<p>than just collecting transaction fees, right?</p>
<p>Like for example, there&rsquo;s decentralized exchanges on chain</p>
<p>like Uniswap and like let&rsquo;s say the price</p>
<p>of ETH versus USDC was 2,700 the previous block,</p>
<p>but then there was a bit of a market drop</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s 2,680 where you can go on Uniswap</p>
<p>and you can just like gobble up the entire part of,</p>
<p>you know, the automated order book</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like between 2,700 and 2,680, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and then at the same time, you like run a bot</p>
<p>and you know, you buy some ETH back at 2,680</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve just like made about $10 of profit, right?</p>
<p>So, or well, $10 times, you know, whatever the depth is.</p>
<p>Right, so there&rsquo;s lots of little things like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also things that involve like front running</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s transactions.</p>
<p>So one example of this would be that if someone sends</p>
<p>a transaction that says, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>buy me five ETH for whatever price that you can get,</p>
<p>then, but with a maximum of, let&rsquo;s say $15,000,</p>
<p>then you can go and like, you can send each,</p>
<p>put a transaction right in front of that transaction</p>
<p>and you can like buy up that ETH first</p>
<p>and then you resell it to him at, you know,</p>
<p>$15,000 minus one, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then you get to make a little bit of money that way.</p>
<p>Exactly, so there&rsquo;s a lot of these different</p>
<p>like arbitrage, front running, back running,</p>
<p>these different tricks that allow block proposers to.</p>
<p>To get some percentage on top, like overhead.</p>
<p>Exactly, and the reason why this is a challenge</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s, I mean, like first of all,</p>
<p>it sometimes degrades user experience</p>
<p>because users get no less favorable trades,</p>
<p>but there are sometimes ways to like mitigate that</p>
<p>for applications, sometimes it&rsquo;s not that bad,</p>
<p>but like the bigger risk that I think some people consider</p>
<p>more existential is that there&rsquo;s just much more</p>
<p>economies of scale in figuring out</p>
<p>how to extract all this revenue, right?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re just collecting transaction fees,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t really economies of scale,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t really benefits to centralizing, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a very simple formula,</p>
<p>you just like grab up the transactions that pay you the most.</p>
<p>But with MEV, there&rsquo;s all these sophisticated algorithms</p>
<p>and if you have lots of money,</p>
<p>then you can hire really smart people</p>
<p>to make amazing algorithms and then you can use</p>
<p>the other half of your money to get a lot of mining power</p>
<p>or a lot of stake and you get a lot of opportunities</p>
<p>to use your even better algorithms.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this risk that like as a result of this,</p>
<p>mining is basically, or even validating proof of stake</p>
<p>is going to centralize.</p>
<p>So I think the ecosystem is best replied</p>
<p>to this sort of risk and it&rsquo;s the direction</p>
<p>where projects like Flashbots are going already</p>
<p>is if you can&rsquo;t eliminate the centralization,</p>
<p>then you try to firewall it, right?</p>
<p>And the way that you firewall it is you basically say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to try to deliberately create a marketplace</p>
<p>where people can just do the complicated work</p>
<p>of creating what are called bundles,</p>
<p>like bundles of transactions that are very profitable, right?</p>
<p>And then at the other side of the market,</p>
<p>you just have like block proposes reminders</p>
<p>that are just dumb notes.</p>
<p>And they go and ask the what are called searchers,</p>
<p>the bundle creators, and they just ask like,</p>
<p>hey, like how much can you give me if I put in your bundle?</p>
<p>And then they just take the highest offer, right?</p>
<p>So you sort of separate out the task</p>
<p>and you have the easy part and then you have the hard part</p>
<p>and you have like this special class of actor</p>
<p>called a searcher that does the hard part</p>
<p>and then the easy part, the people doing the easy part,</p>
<p>which is just miners and validators,</p>
<p>they kind of just talk to all the different people</p>
<p>doing the searching and they just accept the highest bidder.</p>
<p>So this is also just like an interesting example</p>
<p>of like economic design philosophy, right?</p>
<p>Like sometimes you can&rsquo;t just like make centralization</p>
<p>go away, sometimes it&rsquo;s inevitable,</p>
<p>but no, at least you can try to kind of contain it,</p>
<p>you can direct it or you can even sort of firewall it away</p>
<p>from core consensus,</p>
<p>the parts that really do need to be decentralized.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t see it as an existential risk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a bit of a problem</p>
<p>that it has to be constantly dealt with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a risk, like there&rsquo;s obviously a risk</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a very severe problem</p>
<p>and that even this flash bots approach</p>
<p>has some fatal flaw or whatever.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re definitely approaching it</p>
<p>with the mindset of this is a problem</p>
<p>and like, yes, we do have to do some work to solve it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re doing it and so far it&rsquo;s being solved.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about the other really, really fascinating</p>
<p>part of the future of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not call it Ethereum 2.0,</p>
<p>but the future of Ethereum</p>
<p>that also may require a hard fork,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you can correct me on this,</p>
<p>is well, broadly ideas for scaling.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And more specifically sort of layer two</p>
<p>or layer one and two intersection ideas</p>
<p>of how to achieve scaling.</p>
<p>And at the core of that is the idea of sharding.</p>
<p>So first, what is sharding?</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s two major paradigms</p>
<p>for scaling blockchains, right?</p>
<p>As you said, layer one and layer two.</p>
<p>And layer one basically means</p>
<p>make the blockchain itself capable</p>
<p>of processing more transactions</p>
<p>by having some mechanism by which it can do that</p>
<p>despite the fact that there&rsquo;s a limit</p>
<p>to the capacity of each participant in the blockchain.</p>
<p>And then layer two says,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re gonna keep the blockchain as is,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna create clever protocols</p>
<p>that sit on top of the blockchain</p>
<p>that still use the blockchain</p>
<p>and then still kind of inherit things</p>
<p>like the security guarantees of a blockchain.</p>
<p>But at the same time, a lot of things are done off chain.</p>
<p>And so you get more scalability that way.</p>
<p>So in Ethereum, the most popular paradigm</p>
<p>for layer two is rollups</p>
<p>and the most popular paradigm for layer one is sharding.</p>
<p>So one way to achieve layer one scaling</p>
<p>is to increase the block size.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Block size wars, quote, unquote.</p>
<p>And you actually tweeted something about,</p>
<p>people are saying that Vitalik changed his mind about,</p>
<p>he went from being a small blocker to a big to small.</p>
<p>But you said, I&rsquo;ve been a medium blocker all along.</p>
<p>So maybe you can also comment on where,</p>
<p>on the very basic aspect before we even get to sharding</p>
<p>of where you stand on this block size debate.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So the way that I think about the trade off</p>
<p>is I think about it as a trade off</p>
<p>between making it easy to write to the blockchain</p>
<p>and making it easy to read the blockchain.</p>
<p>So when I say read, I just mean,</p>
<p>have a node and actually verify it</p>
<p>and make sure that it&rsquo;s correct and all of those things.</p>
<p>And then by write, I mean send transactions.</p>
<p>So I think for decentralization,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for both of these tasks to be accessible.</p>
<p>And I think that they&rsquo;re about equally importance.</p>
<p>If you have a chain that&rsquo;s too expensive to read,</p>
<p>then everyone will just trust a few people</p>
<p>to read for them.</p>
<p>And then those people can change the rules</p>
<p>without anyone else&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>But if on the other hand,</p>
<p>it becomes really expensive to write,</p>
<p>then everyone will move on to basically</p>
<p>second layer systems that are incredibly centralized.</p>
<p>And that takes away from decentralization</p>
<p>and self sovereignty as well.</p>
<p>So this has been my viewpoints</p>
<p>pretty much the whole time, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you need this balance</p>
<p>and going in one direction or the other direction</p>
<p>is very unhealthy.</p>
<p>In the Bitcoin case, basically what happened</p>
<p>was that Bitcoin originally,</p>
<p>at the very beginning, it didn&rsquo;t really have a block size.</p>
<p>It just had an accidental block size of 32 meg,</p>
<p>or block size limit of 32 megabytes</p>
<p>because that just happens to be the limit</p>
<p>of the peer to peer messages.</p>
<p>But then&hellip;</p>
<p>Interesting, I didn&rsquo;t even know that part.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then Satoshi back in 2010</p>
<p>was worried that even 32 megabyte blocks</p>
<p>would be too hard to process.</p>
<p>So he put the limit down to one megabyte.</p>
<p>And I think the&hellip;</p>
<p>I put, you mean sneaked in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like made an update to the Bitcoin software</p>
<p>that made blocks bigger than one,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a million bytes invalid.</p>
<p>And I think the impression that most people had at the time</p>
<p>is that this is just a temporary safety measure.</p>
<p>And over time, as we become more confident in the software,</p>
<p>that limit would be raised somewhat.</p>
<p>But then when the actual usage of the blockchain</p>
<p>started going up, and then it started going up</p>
<p>first to 100 kilobytes per block,</p>
<p>then to 250 kilobytes per block,</p>
<p>then to 500 kilobytes per block,</p>
<p>there started coming out of the woodworks this opinion</p>
<p>that no, that limit should just not be increased.</p>
<p>And then there are all of these attempts at compromising.</p>
<p>First, there was a proposal for 20 megabyte blocks.</p>
<p>Then there was the 248 proposal,</p>
<p>which is a bit ironic because the 248 proposal</p>
<p>started off being a small block negotiating position.</p>
<p>But then when the big block people came back and said,</p>
<p>hey, aren&rsquo;t we gonna do this?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, no, no, no, we don&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want the block size increases anymore.</p>
<p>So there were these two different positions,</p>
<p>the small blockers.</p>
<p>I think they valued one megabyte blocks for two reasons.</p>
<p>One is that they just really, really believe</p>
<p>in the importance of being able to read the chain.</p>
<p>But two is that a lot of them really believe</p>
<p>in maintaining this norm of never hard forking, right?</p>
<p>So the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork</p>
<p>is basically that in a soft fork,</p>
<p>any block that&rsquo;s valid under the new rules</p>
<p>was still valid under the old rules.</p>
<p>So if you have a client that verifies</p>
<p>according to the old rules,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll still be able to accept the chain</p>
<p>that follows the new rules.</p>
<p>Whereas with a hard fork,</p>
<p>you have to update your code in order to stay on the chain.</p>
<p>And look, they have this belief that soft forks</p>
<p>are kind of either less coercive than hard forks,</p>
<p>which by the way, I completely disagree with.</p>
<p>I actually think soft forks are more coercive</p>
<p>because basically they force everyone who disagrees</p>
<p>to sort of go along by default.</p>
<p>But, or they have this opinion that there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more difficult to abuse soft forks</p>
<p>to do really mean things like,</p>
<p>or that like completely violate people&rsquo;s expectations,</p>
<p>like increasing the supply, which is like,</p>
<p>I think there is some truth to that.</p>
<p>So because of these reasons,</p>
<p>they just say we&rsquo;re only going to do soft forks</p>
<p>and we want to just not do any hard forks.</p>
<p>And they eventually discovered this idea</p>
<p>called segregated witness that allows for like</p>
<p>a very tiny block size increase</p>
<p>to like the equivalent of about two megabytes</p>
<p>with a soft fork.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this really like weird and devious trick.</p>
<p>Like basically what they do is they take the signatures</p>
<p>of transactions and then they put them outside of the block.</p>
<p>And then they add an extra rule that says that like every,</p>
<p>for a block to be valid,</p>
<p>the block has to come with a separate,</p>
<p>like basically extension block</p>
<p>that contains all of the transaction signatures, right?</p>
<p>So when you measure it, according to the old rules,</p>
<p>like, hey, it adds up to less than a million,</p>
<p>but actually there&rsquo;s this extension block</p>
<p>that the old protocol doesn&rsquo;t even know about.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hack that seemed to work to in a small way</p>
<p>extend the size of the block size.</p>
<p>So the small block side was like happy</p>
<p>with these very low levels of block size.</p>
<p>And then the big block side wanted to expand to,</p>
<p>at the very least go to four megabytes,</p>
<p>then maybe go maybe eight, 20.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s disagreements within there as well.</p>
<p>I definitely was favoring the big side</p>
<p>the whole way through, as you can probably tell, but.</p>
<p>Even though, so the argument against the big</p>
<p>is that it makes things more centralized.</p>
<p>Yes, because fewer people can run a note</p>
<p>that verifies the chain.</p>
<p>And also because any of these things</p>
<p>would require a hard fork</p>
<p>and hard forks are inherently risky.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s truth to that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pro hard fork.</p>
<p>I think hard forks are actually like</p>
<p>in a political economic sense,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re better than soft forks.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s, okay, okay.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful principle as stated</p>
<p>that soft forks may be more coercive than hard forks.</p>
<p>This is not just about cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>This is about politics and life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re okay with hard forks.</p>
<p>In fact, you think hard forks is the right way</p>
<p>to make changes because then everybody&rsquo;s forced</p>
<p>to make a decision.</p>
<p>Do you accept this change or not</p>
<p>as opposed to ideas being sneaked in behind the door</p>
<p>and that decision is forced on you?</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so, but hard forks, some people say,</p>
<p>this is when they talk about sort of Ethereum,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s some aspect to a hard fork</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to upgrade a,</p>
<p>what is it, airplane while it&rsquo;s flying.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>I think soft forks are also upgrading an airplane</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s flying.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a smaller upgrades.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s some truth to that.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s definitely a bit more risk of like a split</p>
<p>as a result of a hard fork than as a result of a soft fork.</p>
<p>And the split is highly undesirable, right?</p>
<p>Well, it depends.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s a split because of a bug, then that&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a split as a result of political differences,</p>
<p>then I think like a split is better than, you know,</p>
<p>one side being forced to basically just like suck it up</p>
<p>and accept the majority position even if it really hates it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also political connections</p>
<p>throughout the history of the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sometimes groups of people</p>
<p>that strongly disagree with each other</p>
<p>should be forced to work it out.</p>
<p>Even if they, even when a split seems like an easy thing</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>And I think like, well, for blockchains in particular,</p>
<p>the costs of people being able to like peacefully do their,</p>
<p>go off and do their own thing are much lower, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, okay, if you have a country</p>
<p>and you have two groups, then like often enough,</p>
<p>like fighting out the new rules requires, you know,</p>
<p>a civil war requires everyone to move and so forth.</p>
<p>But no, on a blockchain, like, you know,</p>
<p>the costs are lower and so.</p>
<p>So if you were to look at the way things worked out</p>
<p>with the block size wars and there was a split,</p>
<p>what is it, Bitcoin Cash and all this?</p>
<p>In Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you, like you looking, putting on your historian hat,</p>
<p>you mentioned offline you like Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>So if Dan Carlin wanted to do an episode</p>
<p>on the block size wars, do you think it could&rsquo;ve turned out</p>
<p>better or do you, are you okay with the way it turned out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely disappointed with what happens</p>
<p>with the block, with the big block side.</p>
<p>I think the source of my disappointment is that like,</p>
<p>one of the things that you notice when just looking at</p>
<p>like this political disagreements generally,</p>
<p>especially when you have environments where, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re authoritarian or like single party dominated</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s some opposition party</p>
<p>and the opposition often has like very legitimate grievances.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the thing you notice is that often</p>
<p>enough the opposition just sucks, right?</p>
<p>Like it just doesn&rsquo;t have, you know, political capacity.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have like the ability to come up with policy</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s entire culture is like designed around</p>
<p>resisting much more than it&rsquo;s designed around like,</p>
<p>you know, actually debating serious policy trade offs.</p>
<p>And I worry or I guess not so much worry</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s already happened.</p>
<p>I unfortunately think that Bitcoin Cash ended up</p>
<p>being a victim of this, right?</p>
<p>Like first, no, there was a split with Bitcoin Cash.</p>
<p>And then of course, Craig Wright came in</p>
<p>and you know, Craig Wright was this basically scammer</p>
<p>who just keeps on pretending that he is Satoshi Nakamoto,</p>
<p>the inventor of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Hey, Craig Wright&rsquo;s legal team, do you hear me?</p>
<p>Yes, I still think your client is a scammer.</p>
<p>So sue me.</p>
<p>This is definitely gonna be death for a search</p>
<p>because I gotta ask you about Craig.</p>
<p>I guess these people have been contacting me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to figure out like,</p>
<p>what is up with this human being?</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s somebody who is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start this Satoshi Nakamoto, who is the creator</p>
<p>of Bitcoin, who&rsquo;s anonymous.</p>
<p>And actually most really big people</p>
<p>in the cryptocurrency space do not like yourself</p>
<p>and others do not dare claim that they are even</p>
<p>for fun Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>In fact, if Satoshi Nakamoto is still alive</p>
<p>and is like, if say you were Satoshi Nakamoto,</p>
<p>it seems like the thing he would do is probably</p>
<p>or she is trying to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that, there&rsquo;s a guy named Craig Wright</p>
<p>who continually keeps claiming that he is in fact</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people.</p>
<p>So on him, if we could just linger on him,</p>
<p>what do you make of this character?</p>
<p>What are we supposed to make of this character?</p>
<p>Should he be ignored?</p>
<p>Is there any possible truth to his claims?</p>
<p>What do you make of him?</p>
<p>The analogy that&rsquo;s at the top of my head</p>
<p>will get a bit political, but that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had Michael Malice.</p>
<p>So I guess I view Craig Wright</p>
<p>as being kind of like a Donald Trump figure</p>
<p>in that he&rsquo;s not very intellectual,</p>
<p>but I think he gets a big audience</p>
<p>because he says things that play to the resentments</p>
<p>that people have and he says things</p>
<p>that people wants to hear.</p>
<p>Like in the wake of this block size war,</p>
<p>the big blockers did feel very disenchanted.</p>
<p>They felt that Bitcoin always had this vision</p>
<p>that we were supposed to just keep increasing</p>
<p>the block size and Bitcoin is peer to peer cash.</p>
<p>It says so in the white paper.</p>
<p>And then this elitist clique of core devs</p>
<p>just came in and said, no, no, no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna impose this totally different vision.</p>
<p>And if you ever want your scalability,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to wait for us to create</p>
<p>this totally unproven fancy technology</p>
<p>called the lightning network</p>
<p>that works under completely different principles.</p>
<p>And they were very angry at this.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think a lot of that anger is justified,</p>
<p>but at the same time, when people are in that mental state,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very easy for you to just kind of like latch on.</p>
<p>And if you find someone who expresses anger</p>
<p>at the same things that you&rsquo;re angry at,</p>
<p>and also like it seems like someone who&rsquo;s strong</p>
<p>and seems like someone who might be good to rally around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to just like get behind that.</p>
<p>But that extra part about it where he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamura, I don&rsquo;t understand why that&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, he could have done it without that,</p>
<p>but that just, it&rsquo;s a marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Like it sort of gives him more salience.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s other big block personalities, right?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the difference with Craig Wright?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not just a big block personality,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s potentially Satoshi.</p>
<p>And he did say all the big block things, right?</p>
<p>Like he talked about how,</p>
<p>oh, the concept of a fee market is fundamentally</p>
<p>like economically wrong and it should be a free market</p>
<p>and you should be able to have blocks as big as you want.</p>
<p>So like he repeated all the talking points.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people were kind of sucked into that, right?</p>
<p>And so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate</p>
<p>a big part of the Bitcoin cash community for a long time.</p>
<p>And then eventually, of course,</p>
<p>more and more people started to catch on.</p>
<p>He would just say technical things</p>
<p>that are completely wrong, right?</p>
<p>Like one example of this that I remember</p>
<p>is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits</p>
<p>and two to the power of 256 bits, right?</p>
<p>So the difference is, it&rsquo;s like the difference</p>
<p>between 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers, right?</p>
<p>And because of this, like he made this arguments</p>
<p>that said that Bitcoin&rsquo;s elliptic curve</p>
<p>is friendly to cryptographic pairings.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to understand what that is,</p>
<p>but if you want to know,</p>
<p>I have articles on both at Vitalik.ca.</p>
<p>But basically he made this like technical argument</p>
<p>that really hedged on this point.</p>
<p>And then when people pressed him on,</p>
<p>it was like, yes, but no, no, like what?</p>
<p>Look, exactly, the height is like what?</p>
<p>Two to the 256 bits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very tiny amount of information.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, two to the 256 bits</p>
<p>is more than the amount of information in the universe.</p>
<p>And like he equivocated and kind of like preyed</p>
<p>on people&rsquo;s inability to understand</p>
<p>that mathematical nuance.</p>
<p>And I called him out.</p>
<p>And eventually I even called him out in person</p>
<p>at this conference in Seoul.</p>
<p>Like I just stood up and asked,</p>
<p>hey, conference organizer,</p>
<p>why are you letting this fraud speak at this conference?</p>
<p>And I remember even some big blockers at the time</p>
<p>getting angry at me.</p>
<p>But eventually they did get rid of him.</p>
<p>And then Craig, well, basically Craig Wright</p>
<p>was forced to split off</p>
<p>because the rest of the community refused</p>
<p>to accept some network change that he wanted.</p>
<p>And so then there was the BCH and BSP.</p>
<p>And then in the Bitcoin Cash community,</p>
<p>there was this drama of,</p>
<p>are they going to add a developer fund</p>
<p>where they redirect 12 and a half percent of the revenue</p>
<p>from the miners to the devs?</p>
<p>And according to the libertarian not aggression principle,</p>
<p>is this technically theft?</p>
<p>Like his understanding of the technical depths</p>
<p>of cryptocurrency was lacking in a way</p>
<p>that Satoshi Nakamoto certainly would not.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>But the point is that even after Craig Wright got expunged,</p>
<p>the Bitcoin Cash community kept having these disagreements.</p>
<p>And now after this development funds dispute,</p>
<p>there was a further split between Bitcoin Cash and ABC.</p>
<p>So the branch continues to extend.</p>
<p>So in that way, it&rsquo;s disappointing</p>
<p>to see those kinds of splitting that was never resolved.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I would have definitely like wanted to see more</p>
<p>of a kind of like the principled coin</p>
<p>with like tries to be Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but follows consistent big block values.</p>
<p>But I know maybe I should just like stop expecting projects</p>
<p>that I have no involvement in to care at all</p>
<p>about what my values are.</p>
<p>And like maybe Ethereum just like is.</p>
<p>I think you have a powerful voice</p>
<p>and you can inspire other projects</p>
<p>to live up to their best possible selves.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the layer one approach.</p>
<p>The other layer one within Ethereum</p>
<p>is the idea of sharding.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What the heck is sharding?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What does the future of sharding look like?</p>
<p>Right, so to summarize that big long tangent</p>
<p>that we just went into.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful tangent by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the basic tangent.</p>
<p>And I think like crypto is just one</p>
<p>of the most underrated aspects of crypto</p>
<p>is I think how you can like analyze the sociology</p>
<p>and the politics and the anthropology.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure Dan Carlin would have fun exploring</p>
<p>the space at some point.</p>
<p>But like the core trade off, right?</p>
<p>Is that if you scale blockchains the dumb way</p>
<p>just by increasing the parameters,</p>
<p>then eventually you just make it harder and harder</p>
<p>to participate as a node and you end up with a system</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like 20 computers running the whole thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just very centralized.</p>
<p>So sharding basically says, well,</p>
<p>instead of just increasing the parameters,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to do is we&rsquo;re going to change</p>
<p>the blockchain architecture in such a way</p>
<p>that each individual node in the blockchain</p>
<p>only needs to store a small portion of the data</p>
<p>and only needs to process a small portion</p>
<p>of the transactions.</p>
<p>So you can think about it as being like inspired</p>
<p>by BitTorrent, right?</p>
<p>Like on BitTorrent, there&rsquo;s no such thing</p>
<p>as a BitTorrent full node that has every movie, right?</p>
<p>You know, the work is like split up among a huge number</p>
<p>of computers and like that makes sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, the only sane way</p>
<p>to scale a system like that.</p>
<p>And if they actually tried making a version of BitTorrent</p>
<p>that required full nodes that store every movie,</p>
<p>then, you know, it would have like zero censorship</p>
<p>resistance and it would just like, you know,</p>
<p>be dead in an instant.</p>
<p>So the challenge with taking that model</p>
<p>and applying it to blockchains, right?</p>
<p>Is that blockchains aren&rsquo;t just about like spreading data</p>
<p>around, they&rsquo;re about agreeing on exactly what data</p>
<p>was spread around and ensuring that everything</p>
<p>that you agree on actually is correct.</p>
<p>And so you have this paradox where let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you want to have a system that supports 10,000 transactions</p>
<p>a second, but each computer in the network</p>
<p>can only personally verify a hundred transactions a second.</p>
<p>So how can each computer get a guarantee</p>
<p>about the other 9,900 without actually going</p>
<p>and verifying them themselves?</p>
<p>And it turns out that there are some,</p>
<p>like a bundle of different tricks that can do that, right?</p>
<p>So like one of them is just random sampling.</p>
<p>So the idea behind random sampling is like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for simplicity, this is a proof of stake chain</p>
<p>and you have 10,000 validators, validators are like,</p>
<p>you know, the stakers and like for simplicity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll assume they all have the same number of coins, right?</p>
<p>If someone has more coins, we&rsquo;ll just kind of split them up</p>
<p>and pretend they&rsquo;re 10 stakers.</p>
<p>Then you do like some random shuffling</p>
<p>and you basically say, these random hundred validators</p>
<p>are assigned to validate this block.</p>
<p>These random hundred validators</p>
<p>are assigned to validate this block.</p>
<p>These random hundred validators</p>
<p>are assigned to validate this block.</p>
<p>And so each individual computer only gets assigned</p>
<p>to validate like a small piece,</p>
<p>but then the way that the information</p>
<p>about like what&rsquo;s valid gets passed around, right?</p>
<p>Is that when these hundred participants validate a block,</p>
<p>they all sign a message basically saying like,</p>
<p>yes, we agree that this block is valid.</p>
<p>And then like they combine that signature into one</p>
<p>and then they broadcast that signature.</p>
<p>And then everyone else,</p>
<p>instead of verifying the blocks directly,</p>
<p>just verifies that signature, right?</p>
<p>And so if I see the signature,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not directly convinced that that block is valid,</p>
<p>but what I am convinced of is that out of this committee</p>
<p>of this randomly selected group of a hundred validators,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say at least 70 of them agree</p>
<p>that this block is valid.</p>
<p>And so if I trust that the majority</p>
<p>of these participants are all honest,</p>
<p>then because it&rsquo;s all randomly selected,</p>
<p>the attacker can&rsquo;t just like force themselves</p>
<p>into one committee.</p>
<p>And so the attacker is gonna be evenly spread out too.</p>
<p>And so if the entire set of validators is mostly honest,</p>
<p>every committee is gonna be mostly honest.</p>
<p>And so like bad blocks are not gonna go through, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like one simple form of sharding.</p>
<p>There was also other more clever things that you can do.</p>
<p>So for example, there&rsquo;s this concept of a ZK snarks, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call it as your knowledge proofs.</p>
<p>So this is the idea that you can make a cryptographic proof</p>
<p>that says, I verified or I ran some complex computation</p>
<p>on this piece of data and I got this answer.</p>
<p>And so if you make these kinds of proofs,</p>
<p>then like if you see a ZK snark</p>
<p>that says some block is valid,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re convinced that that block is valid.</p>
<p>And even if everyone in that committee is evil,</p>
<p>like they have no way of making a valid proof</p>
<p>for a bad block, right?</p>
<p>Like, because the proof itself,</p>
<p>like it is a proof that you did the computation</p>
<p>where that proof is much easier to verify</p>
<p>than just running the computation yourself.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s once again, super awesome mathematical</p>
<p>or cryptographic magic behind making ZK snarks work.</p>
<p>But it gives you a little bit of a leg up</p>
<p>over the 51% honest assumption.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little hack that improves upon the random</p>
<p>sampling thing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And like, there&rsquo;s other hacks, right?</p>
<p>Like there is another hack called data availability</p>
<p>sampling that allows you to make sure that the data</p>
<p>in the blocks was actually published.</p>
<p>But like, basically, like if you stack a couple</p>
<p>of these tricks on top of each other,</p>
<p>you can create a system where like I,</p>
<p>as an individual participant can be convinced</p>
<p>that everything that&rsquo;s going on in this distributed</p>
<p>blockchain thing is correct without actually personally</p>
<p>checking more than like a percent of it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sharding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sharding.</p>
<p>But the, as I understand, maybe correct me on this,</p>
<p>is in the space of Ethereum, the sharding happens</p>
<p>on some fixed number.</p>
<p>Like the split is on some fixed number.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 64 is the currently sort of proposed number.</p>
<p>So how does that help scaling?</p>
<p>Is it just the fixed constant scaling by 64?</p>
<p>And is that a way to achieve those crazy,</p>
<p>the crazy amount of scaling that seems to be required</p>
<p>to use cryptocurrency for purchasing?</p>
<p>So doing like competing with credit cards</p>
<p>and Visa and so on.</p>
<p>So first, I think like the 64 can be hard forked up</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve set it so that like there&rsquo;s theoretically space</p>
<p>in the data structure for 1024 shards,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that 64 of them are turned on.</p>
<p>There are challenges with having more shards</p>
<p>because like you have to have logic that just like checks</p>
<p>and manages all of those shards.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s too many of them,</p>
<p>then that becomes too expensive.</p>
<p>But even still, you can improve quite a bit.</p>
<p>And then the other thing that we&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>if what we&rsquo;re getting maximum scalability</p>
<p>by combining rollups and sharding.</p>
<p>So this might be a good time to talk about rollups.</p>
<p>What are rollups?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re moving into layer two ideas.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the idea behind a rollup is basically that,</p>
<p>so instead of just publishing transactions</p>
<p>directly on chain and having everyone do all of the checking</p>
<p>of those transactions,</p>
<p>what you do is you create a system</p>
<p>where users send their transactions to some central party</p>
<p>called an aggregator.</p>
<p>And like, well, theoretically, you can have a system</p>
<p>where like the aggregator switches around</p>
<p>or where anyone can be an aggregator.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still like permissionless to send things.</p>
<p>Then what the aggregator does is they strip out</p>
<p>all of the transaction data that like is not relevant</p>
<p>to helping people update the state.</p>
<p>So when I say the state,</p>
<p>this is a very important kind of technical term</p>
<p>for blockchains.</p>
<p>I mean, like account balances, code,</p>
<p>like things that are like memory,</p>
<p>internal memory of smart contracts,</p>
<p>like basically everything the blockchain</p>
<p>actually has to keep track of and remember, right?</p>
<p>So you just put in,</p>
<p>you take all these transactions,</p>
<p>strip out all the data that&rsquo;s not relevant</p>
<p>to telling people how to update the state.</p>
<p>And then you take the data that&rsquo;s needed</p>
<p>to update the state,</p>
<p>and then you like really compress it, right?</p>
<p>So like, for example, if we say,</p>
<p>I, Vitalik, have an account that&rsquo;s 0xAB58,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it&rsquo;s 20 bytes.</p>
<p>Well, instead we can say,</p>
<p>well, I have an account that is number 1874224 in the tree.</p>
<p>And that goes down from 20 bytes</p>
<p>to just like an index and a position,</p>
<p>which is three bytes, right?</p>
<p>So you use all sorts of these fancy compression tricks,</p>
<p>and you basically just,</p>
<p>instead of publishing all these transactions,</p>
<p>you publish this like tiny compressed blob, right?</p>
<p>So the amount of data that goes on chain</p>
<p>goes down by maybe about a factor of 10, right?</p>
<p>And then the second thing is that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do the computation on chain,</p>
<p>instead you do the computation off chain,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s one of two ways to do this, right?</p>
<p>One is called a ZK rollup,</p>
<p>which is you just provide a ZK SNARK that basically says,</p>
<p>hey, look, I did this computation,</p>
<p>and I have this proof that here&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>some hash of the result and it&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And then you stick it on chain,</p>
<p>and everyone verifies this one proof</p>
<p>instead of verifying all these transactions.</p>
<p>And then the other approach is called an optimistic rollup,</p>
<p>which is basically made of the scheme where,</p>
<p>like, first someone says like,</p>
<p>hey, this is what I think the result of applying</p>
<p>these transactions is.</p>
<p>And then someone else can say,</p>
<p>I disagree, the result is different.</p>
<p>And only if two people disagree,</p>
<p>do you actually just like publish all of the data</p>
<p>and run that whole block on chain.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s disagreements,</p>
<p>then you just like run everything on chain</p>
<p>and whoever was wrong, like loses a lot of money, right?</p>
<p>So like disagreements are very rare</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very expensive.</p>
<p>And then a ZK rollup,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even rely on this like challenging game at all,</p>
<p>you just rely on a proof.</p>
<p>So the core principle is basically that</p>
<p>instead of lots of transactions</p>
<p>and everyone verifies every transaction,</p>
<p>it is you take the transactions,</p>
<p>you strip them down and compress them as much as possible,</p>
<p>then stick that on the blockchain.</p>
<p>You do need to stick something on the blockchain</p>
<p>just so that everyone else can like keep up to date</p>
<p>with the state so they know what all the contracts are,</p>
<p>what all the balances are and all of this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very small amount of data.</p>
<p>And then you use one of these other off chain games,</p>
<p>could be this optimistic game, could be a ZK snark</p>
<p>to just prove that somebody out there did the computation</p>
<p>and the result is correct, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re pushing like 90% of the work off chain</p>
<p>and then, well, 90% of the data</p>
<p>and 99% of the computation off chain,</p>
<p>and then you still have 10% of the data</p>
<p>and 1% of the computation on chain.</p>
<p>And so your scalability goes up by a factor of about 100.</p>
<p>So these systems are already alive</p>
<p>for some applications, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something called loopering,</p>
<p>which is just a ZK roll up for payments, right?</p>
<p>So you can have assets inside of the loopering system</p>
<p>and you can go around and transfer them,</p>
<p>and you get like much lower transaction fees, right?</p>
<p>Like instead of $5, you&rsquo;d have to pay like less than 5 cents.</p>
<p>But the only problem is that this only supports</p>
<p>a couple of applications right now,</p>
<p>like making one that supports anything</p>
<p>that you can do on Ethereum just takes a bit more work,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s being done as well, right?</p>
<p>So like within a few months, I&rsquo;m expecting fully Ethereum</p>
<p>capable roll ups to be available as well.</p>
<p>So roll ups, just summarizing,</p>
<p>do most of the work off chain,</p>
<p>put only a little bit on chain, factor of 100 scaling,</p>
<p>sharding, another factor of 100 scaling,</p>
<p>100 times 100 factor of 10,000,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of transactions a second,</p>
<p>and like, you know, there&rsquo;s your scalability.</p>
<p>Okay, so you achieve scalability,</p>
<p>you can do a large number of transactions very quickly</p>
<p>and the cost of doing those transactions are much lower.</p>
<p>You wrote that in the long term ZK roll ups</p>
<p>are going to win in terms of layer two technology.</p>
<p>Specifically you wrote, in general,</p>
<p>my own view is that in the short term,</p>
<p>optimistic roll ups, as you were saying,</p>
<p>are likely to win out of general purpose EVM computation</p>
<p>and ZK roll ups are likely to win out for simple payments,</p>
<p>exchange and other application specific use cases,</p>
<p>just as you were saying.</p>
<p>But in the medium to long term,</p>
<p>ZK roll ups will win out in all use cases</p>
<p>as ZK SNARK technology improves.</p>
<p>Why do you think ZK roll ups are going to win</p>
<p>the big picture battle over layer two technologies?</p>
<p>So I think ZK roll ups, like once you accept</p>
<p>that the technology works are just like conceptually simpler</p>
<p>and they have nicer properties.</p>
<p>The reason is that they do not have this concept</p>
<p>of a challenge game, right?</p>
<p>Like, as I mentioned in an optimistic roll up,</p>
<p>the way that you ensure that the results are correct</p>
<p>is that you let one person submit</p>
<p>and like they just submit with no proof.</p>
<p>They just say, here&rsquo;s what I think the result is.</p>
<p>And then if someone else disagrees,</p>
<p>they make their own submission.</p>
<p>And then if you have two disagreeing submissions,</p>
<p>then you actually publish it on Chase.</p>
<p>And then you see who&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But for this to work, like you need to actually wait</p>
<p>for someone to disagree, right?</p>
<p>So like, for example, if I have an asset inside</p>
<p>of an optimistic roll up and I wants to withdraw it,</p>
<p>then I actually have to wait a week to withdraw it.</p>
<p>Because like, if the block that contains my withdrawal</p>
<p>turned out to be invalid,</p>
<p>then there needs to be space for someone</p>
<p>to disagree with it, right?</p>
<p>Whereas with a ZK roll up,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t need time for disagreeing</p>
<p>because you just have a proof, right?</p>
<p>As soon as a block is submitted,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a proof and you know it&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>So if disagreements, especially in the longterm are sparse,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t want to do the optimistic,</p>
<p>the game theoretic thing, you wanna do the ZK stock.</p>
<p>Right, the ZK stuff is just,</p>
<p>like you can win a ZK roll up,</p>
<p>you can withdraw immediately.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to like worry about the economics</p>
<p>of proving as much, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just like fewer issues.</p>
<p>The reason why ZK roll ups are not winning everywhere today</p>
<p>is because ZK stocks are still a crazy new technology,</p>
<p>right, like this is something that 10 years ago,</p>
<p>it existed only in theory and there was none in practice.</p>
<p>Then, eight years ago,</p>
<p>people were just getting excited about it</p>
<p>in Bitcoin conferences for the first time.</p>
<p>Like four years, starting four years ago</p>
<p>or three and a half years ago even,</p>
<p>that was the first time you were able to make</p>
<p>any ZK stock based anything on Ethereum.</p>
<p>And then people started making them</p>
<p>and ZK technology has only really become efficient enough</p>
<p>to do a lot of things within the past</p>
<p>maybe one and a half years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s new technology, it&rsquo;s crazy technology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s admittedly scary technology.</p>
<p>If you wanna learn more,</p>
<p>I also have an article about this on Vitality.ca.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really, really good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, most of your writing, it goes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s technical but it&rsquo;s accessible.</p>
<p>I highly, highly recommend to check out Vitality&rsquo;s articles</p>
<p>and blogs, whatever you call them on the website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brilliant summary of the work.</p>
<p>Actually, Ethereum documentation period is really good.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s somewhat crowdsourced.</p>
<p>That documentation is really, really accessible</p>
<p>and brilliant.</p>
<p>But let me ask about sort of other approaches</p>
<p>to layer two, like side chains.</p>
<p>So the one popular one is Polygon.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Polygon,</p>
<p>which is a layer two network?</p>
<p>Is it positive?</p>
<p>Is it negative for Ethereum?</p>
<p>Is it both?</p>
<p>Does it have a future?</p>
<p>Which is its own chain, but it&rsquo;s using Ethereum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like based on Ethereum essentially.</p>
<p>Or maybe you can describe what it is.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a really big and important difference</p>
<p>in security models between rollups and side chains,</p>
<p>which is basically that rollups inherit</p>
<p>from the security of Ethereum, right?</p>
<p>So if I have coins inside of Loopring or Optimism</p>
<p>or Arbitrum or ZK Sync,</p>
<p>then even if everyone else in the world</p>
<p>who is participating in these ecosystems</p>
<p>hates me and wants to steal my money,</p>
<p>I can still personally make sure</p>
<p>that no matter what happens, I get my money out.</p>
<p>It might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out</p>
<p>and I have to do transactions on the main chain,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll be able to do it.</p>
<p>Whereas in Polygon, which is a side chain,</p>
<p>and so instead of being secured by Ethereum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also in part secured by its own</p>
<p>proof of stake consensus with its own token.</p>
<p>So if 70% of the whole,</p>
<p>or even 51% of the holders of Polygon tokens</p>
<p>wanted to take my money in Polygon, they can, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, and like, to be fair,</p>
<p>like there aren&rsquo;t even, like the supply,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think is even that widely distributed, right?</p>
<p>So like potentially you could,</p>
<p>this idea of 51% of the token holders</p>
<p>coming together and stealing everything,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not impossible, right?</p>
<p>Where does the scaling of Polygon come from?</p>
<p>Like why is it able to process much more transactions</p>
<p>than the Ethereum main chain?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea there?</p>
<p>I think in part, like I imagine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what its capacity level is,</p>
<p>but like I imagine it has a higher capacity</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a bit more willing</p>
<p>to take centralization trade offs.</p>
<p>And then another thing is that like,</p>
<p>if the Ethereum ecosystem,</p>
<p>like even if it did not do that, right?</p>
<p>If you think about an Ethereum ecosystem</p>
<p>hypothetically scaling with side chains,</p>
<p>then you would have a hundred copies of Polygon</p>
<p>and they would each have their own tokens,</p>
<p>they would each have their own chains.</p>
<p>And so even if each one of those chains</p>
<p>was only as scalable as Ethereum,</p>
<p>you could still, like the total sum of them</p>
<p>would still be a hundred times more than Ethereum.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The thing that I want to say in Polygon&rsquo;s favor</p>
<p>just to be very fair to them,</p>
<p>like I really, you know,</p>
<p>I definitely really, you know,</p>
<p>respect the work that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So, you know, start with a bit with that word</p>
<p>of not criticism caution, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s that they made this kind of deliberate trade off</p>
<p>for very pragmatic reasons,</p>
<p>which is that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to scale now.</p>
<p>And there are applications that want to do something now.</p>
<p>And, you know, if there aren&rsquo;t Ethereum friendly options</p>
<p>for them, then like, they&rsquo;re not going to just wait</p>
<p>peacefully and do nothing for 12 months.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to go to, you know,</p>
<p>either Binance Smart Chain or, you know,</p>
<p>one of some other system or potentially something</p>
<p>that just has totally no alignment</p>
<p>with Ethereum values whatsoever.</p>
<p>But whereas, you know, with Polygon,</p>
<p>like the best thing that you can say in Polygon&rsquo;s favor</p>
<p>and against optimism is that, you know,</p>
<p>optimism is not live and Polygon is live, right?</p>
<p>Like it just takes more work to create a system</p>
<p>that has these extra rollups, security features.</p>
<p>And so Polygon just said, we&rsquo;re going to be the system</p>
<p>that makes the pragmatic trade off.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go, you know, functionality first,</p>
<p>and then, you know, we can talk about adding back</p>
<p>the security later.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked to them and like, in principle,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re very, you know, open to the idea</p>
<p>of like adding more security and like becoming more,</p>
<p>becoming a rollup or at least, you know,</p>
<p>adding a Polygon chain that&rsquo;s a rollup</p>
<p>at some point in the future,</p>
<p>which is definitely something I think they, you know,</p>
<p>absolutely should follow through on.</p>
<p>But like the fact that like they exist now,</p>
<p>and so, you know, applications can kind of bootstrap now</p>
<p>on a chain that, you know,</p>
<p>even though its security isn&rsquo;t perfect,</p>
<p>at least it exists and people can go use it.</p>
<p>And then over time, you know, the chain matures</p>
<p>as the applications mature.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s, I think a very reasonable strategy</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m definitely really happy</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re part of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>The history of cryptocurrency has this tension</p>
<p>of really good ideas that are hard to implement.</p>
<p>So they take longer to implement</p>
<p>and ideas that are not as good, but are faster to implement.</p>
<p>This is like the story of like, you have like JavaScript</p>
<p>that basically took over the world</p>
<p>because it was quick to implement within 10 days.</p>
<p>And then like later kept fixing itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of that.</p>
<p>Sort of from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more and more becoming comfortable</p>
<p>and accepting the fact that our whole world</p>
<p>will run a technology that&rsquo;s not as good</p>
<p>as it could have been.</p>
<p>Just because the crappy solution is faster to implement</p>
<p>and it sticks.</p>
<p>What do you make of that tension?</p>
<p>I think the compromise that we&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>within Ethereum is like when we have to take</p>
<p>the crappy solution, we look for crappy solutions</p>
<p>that are forward compatible with becoming good over time.</p>
<p>When you build the quick and dirty thing,</p>
<p>you would still already have ideas in your head</p>
<p>about what the more complete thing</p>
<p>with all the security features added on would look like.</p>
<p>Even if it requires a hard fork?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For example, with sharding, I think it&rsquo;s likely</p>
<p>that the first version of sharding that comes out</p>
<p>is not going to have zkstarks and data availability sampling,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>But we know what these technologies are.</p>
<p>We feel like we have wrapped our heads around them.</p>
<p>And so we know how to build a system</p>
<p>where we can put all the pieces in place</p>
<p>so that it becomes very easy to bolt those components</p>
<p>on in the future.</p>
<p>So if you do things that way, then at the beginning,</p>
<p>you can have your system that has the functionality,</p>
<p>but say has less security or less sustainability</p>
<p>or less of something else.</p>
<p>But then over time, it&rsquo;s designed in such a way</p>
<p>that it has this easy on ramp to adding those things.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t think explicitly</p>
<p>about being future compatible,</p>
<p>then you do often end up with a quick and dirty solution</p>
<p>that backs you into a corner.</p>
<p>And then there are definitely cases</p>
<p>where I think the Ethereum ecosystem has suffered from that.</p>
<p>And we have had to expand pretty significant effort</p>
<p>on, for example, removing features that we didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that we actually can&rsquo;t sustain.</p>
<p>Like one big example is just increasing the gas costs.</p>
<p>So like making some operations more expensive</p>
<p>because they should be expensive</p>
<p>because they actually take a lot of time in the process.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s making something more expensive,</p>
<p>kind of like taking some functionality away.</p>
<p>So if you can like be cognizant</p>
<p>of where you&rsquo;re likely going into the future,</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t know, like even be cognizant</p>
<p>of both the most likely paths that you&rsquo;ll take in the future</p>
<p>and coming, like thinking about your roadmap</p>
<p>and coming up with a roadmap where you know</p>
<p>that like if you wants to do either of those things,</p>
<p>then you have a clean path toward it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the best kind of practical way</p>
<p>to get the best of both worlds that we have.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about this wonderful process of merging.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s the main net,</p>
<p>which is the Ethereum 1.0 chain,</p>
<p>or the, what should we say,</p>
<p>the chain that uses proof of work</p>
<p>as a consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, what is it called?</p>
<p>The beacon chain that uses the proof of stake mechanism.</p>
<p>And I believe the beacon has been deployed successfully,</p>
<p>is working, so that was in December of 2020.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of questions around that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating as well,</p>
<p>but I think the most fascinating question</p>
<p>is about merging those two.</p>
<p>When do the two chains, one that&rsquo;s proof of work,</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s proof of stake, merge?</p>
<p>And what are the most difficult parts of this process?</p>
<p>Right, so as you&rsquo;ve said, right,</p>
<p>the way that we have set up this proof of stake transition</p>
<p>is that at first, the proof of stake chain</p>
<p>just launches on its own, right?</p>
<p>And this is the thing that happened in December.</p>
<p>And the proof of stake chain has been running</p>
<p>for close to six months now.</p>
<p>I mean, by the time people watch this,</p>
<p>it might actually be six months.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t actually coming to consensus</p>
<p>on anything except for itself, right?</p>
<p>So the idea behind that is to just</p>
<p>give the proof of stake chain time to mature,</p>
<p>time for people to build the ecosystem around it,</p>
<p>time to make sure that there aren&rsquo;t any bugs,</p>
<p>and just like prove to the community</p>
<p>that no proof of stake actually is real,</p>
<p>and a full transition is realistic,</p>
<p>because the thing that you&rsquo;re transitioning to</p>
<p>already exists and already works.</p>
<p>And then at some point in the future,</p>
<p>you have this event called the merge,</p>
<p>where you basically take the activity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being done inside of the proof of work chain,</p>
<p>and you actually move it over into the proof of stake chain,</p>
<p>so you get rid of the proof of work side completely.</p>
<p>So the way that the merge will work is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely gone through a few different iterations.</p>
<p>Like the earlier versions of this</p>
<p>actually required more work for users</p>
<p>and more work for clients.</p>
<p>It was much more like,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s this new chain, there&rsquo;s this old chain,</p>
<p>and then everyone has to migrate</p>
<p>from the old chain to the new chain,</p>
<p>and then at some point we&rsquo;ll forget about the old chain.</p>
<p>The new version is designed</p>
<p>to be much more seamless for users, right?</p>
<p>So basically what actually happens is that</p>
<p>the old chain basically becomes embedded</p>
<p>inside the new chain, right?</p>
<p>So starting from the merge transition block,</p>
<p>every proof of stake chain block</p>
<p>is going to contain a block of the,</p>
<p>what we consider now to be,</p>
<p>what we consider to be the Ethereum chain today,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll call it the execution chain.</p>
<p>And then at the same time, to create one of these blocks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to need proof of work anymore, right?</p>
<p>So basically at the same time,</p>
<p>you would both get rid of the proof of work requirements</p>
<p>for one of these blocks to be valid,</p>
<p>but instead you require these blocks</p>
<p>to be embedded inside of the proof of stake blocks, right?</p>
<p>So you basically have like a chain inside a chain.</p>
<p>And this is, from an architecture perspective,</p>
<p>you might think it&rsquo;s a little bit suboptimal,</p>
<p>but it actually has some nice properties</p>
<p>and makes it easier to kind of think about the consensus</p>
<p>and think about what we call the execution layer,</p>
<p>like transactions and contracts kind of separately</p>
<p>and upgrade them separately.</p>
<p>And it also just means that the upgrade process</p>
<p>is extremely seamless, right?</p>
<p>Because from the point of view of a client</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s following the chain,</p>
<p>you basically have to update nothing, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still following the same chain</p>
<p>and follows the same rules,</p>
<p>except instead of checking proof of work,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll switch to checking that these blocks</p>
<p>are embedded inside of blocks of the proof of stake chain.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be this merge block</p>
<p>that will mark this transition.</p>
<p>And over time, I guess the new chain</p>
<p>will contain the full record</p>
<p>of all the transactions that&rsquo;s ever happened</p>
<p>on the previous chain, on the old chain.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;m asking a dumb question here,</p>
<p>but in this process, is the new chain going to have</p>
<p>all the information of the past transactions?</p>
<p>The new chain is not going to hold information</p>
<p>from what happened in the Ethereum chain before the merge,</p>
<p>right, so Ethereum clients that people are going to use</p>
<p>around the time of the merge and soon after the merge,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably just going to sync</p>
<p>and check the proof of work chain up to the merge,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re gonna check the proof of stake chain.</p>
<p>But at some point in the future,</p>
<p>I think people will just stop bothering</p>
<p>checking the proof of work before the merge.</p>
<p>Got it, so that old history information is not important</p>
<p>for the future, like if you&rsquo;re operating actively</p>
<p>on the new chain, that history is not important to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not important, so it&rsquo;s not strictly important</p>
<p>for just like any smart contract</p>
<p>or just like applications that run on the blockchain.</p>
<p>It can be important to users,</p>
<p>and it can be important for some applications,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re basically saying that like maintaining</p>
<p>and serving that is not going to be a simultaneous</p>
<p>with the responsibility of every Ethereum node.</p>
<p>If you want that information, there can be separate</p>
<p>protocols for backing it up.</p>
<p>And like these other protocols actually exist, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something called the graph,</p>
<p>which is doing some history retrieval.</p>
<p>Potentially, you can just take that entire chain</p>
<p>and stake it on BitTorrent.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s lots of ways to like archive it</p>
<p>and create kind of customized search protocols for it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your sense why, so there&rsquo;s a Python 2</p>
<p>and Python 3, and it took forever for people to switch.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense why this merge has been taking longer</p>
<p>than perhaps was expected?</p>
<p>I think the biggest reason is just we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>underestimating the technical complexity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of technical complexity</p>
<p>in making a successful proof of stake chain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of technical complexity</p>
<p>in actually figuring out the transition process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s bigger than social complexity.</p>
<p>So the technical complexity you would say</p>
<p>is the bigger reason for any delays</p>
<p>than the social complexity?</p>
<p>I actually think so.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been very fortunate</p>
<p>to not have too much social complexity around the merge.</p>
<p>So not much drama.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I think the biggest part of the reason</p>
<p>is just because we have been talking</p>
<p>about proof of stake and sharding</p>
<p>as being part of the roadmap</p>
<p>since almost the very beginning of the project, right?</p>
<p>Like the very first proof of stake blog post</p>
<p>is from January 2014, which was two months</p>
<p>after the project started</p>
<p>and maybe even a day after the announcement.</p>
<p>So proof of stake was not something</p>
<p>that we kind of put on anybody by surprise.</p>
<p>And then when the Dow fork happened</p>
<p>and the people on the ETC side split off,</p>
<p>I think it also just happens that a lot of the people</p>
<p>that were not willing to stomach the Dow fork</p>
<p>and then join the ETC side,</p>
<p>they were the more Bitcoiny types.</p>
<p>And the more Bitcoiny types do also tend to like proof</p>
<p>of work more.</p>
<p>And so like that also sort of ended up,</p>
<p>sort of like purifying the communities on both sides,</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>So Ethereum Classic is not switching to proof of stake</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re happy with their setup.</p>
<p>And by the time that it came</p>
<p>to the beacon chain launching into now,</p>
<p>I think the community is very strongly in favor</p>
<p>of the proof of stake switch.</p>
<p>But let me ask the question that no engineer wants to hear,</p>
<p>which is the question of timeline.</p>
<p>When do you think the merge will happen?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense it might happen this year?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense it might be pushed</p>
<p>towards next year, 2022 or even beyond?</p>
<p>I think early 2022 is the most realistic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely still like an optimistic case</p>
<p>of it happening this year,</p>
<p>but the realistic thing to count on is definitely</p>
<p>the very early part of next year.</p>
<p>Is there specific things that stand out to you</p>
<p>that will make you feel good about progress</p>
<p>if you see it happening?</p>
<p>So the thing that we had last month</p>
<p>is we had this online hackathon called Rayanism,</p>
<p>where basically a bunch of the different client developers</p>
<p>that are going to be part of the transition,</p>
<p>like hacks together some test nets</p>
<p>of the post merge Ethereum chain.</p>
<p>So these were only test nets</p>
<p>of what would happen after the merge.</p>
<p>They were not test nets of the transition itself.</p>
<p>So the thing that people are working on now actually</p>
<p>is the transition.</p>
<p>So having a full specification</p>
<p>of both the transition and post transition,</p>
<p>and we have specifications now,</p>
<p>but in a realistic way,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll probably needs to have a couple of changes</p>
<p>and have things that continue to be ironed out,</p>
<p>and then have a test net</p>
<p>that does both the transition and the post transition.</p>
<p>And then once you have a test network,</p>
<p>then you just have to do a lot of testing and audit it,</p>
<p>and then do some runs on not just a specialized test network</p>
<p>but on say an existing test network</p>
<p>like a Robson or Rinkeby</p>
<p>that Ethereum people already significantly use.</p>
<p>And if it works,</p>
<p>then you can deploy the transition on mainnet.</p>
<p>Just as a quick comment,</p>
<p>because this is fascinating.</p>
<p>In August of last year,</p>
<p>there was this Medalla.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s pronounced Medasha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a South American subway station.</p>
<p>I forget where.</p>
<p>But spelled with two Ls.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how Spanish works, right?</p>
<p>Like the two Ls have a&hellip;</p>
<p>Medasha.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, but I read about it in middle of August, August 14th,</p>
<p>there was an incident on that test net.</p>
<p>How does this process work?</p>
<p>What do you learn from those kinds of incidents</p>
<p>when stuff goes wrong in the test process?</p>
<p>I think that incident was that</p>
<p>there was a consensus failure of some kind as I remember.</p>
<p>Basically just different clients</p>
<p>interpreting things in different ways,</p>
<p>and then one of them getting kicked off the network.</p>
<p>And then it ended up taking a while</p>
<p>to actually get everyone to get back online.</p>
<p>A big part of the reason why it took weeks to resolve</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s on a test network,</p>
<p>like the coins are valueless.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not really this big push of any kind</p>
<p>for people to actually go and download the new clients</p>
<p>so they can start participating again.</p>
<p>And so it definitely took a while</p>
<p>until the chain started finalizing again.</p>
<p>And then also there was, I think,</p>
<p>another round of just not finalizing in October,</p>
<p>as I remember.</p>
<p>There were definitely things that we learned.</p>
<p>Like there were a lot of things,</p>
<p>especially that client developers</p>
<p>just learned about like optimization</p>
<p>and how to build their clients</p>
<p>in a way that they can process things efficiently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that we learned</p>
<p>from just like seeing the full life cycle</p>
<p>of what happens when more than a third of the validators</p>
<p>go offline and then finalization stops.</p>
<p>And then that kind of weird unusual state</p>
<p>of the chain continues for a while.</p>
<p>And then eventually everyone who is not participating</p>
<p>just gets enough of their stake.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t use the word slashed,</p>
<p>we use the word leaked for this,</p>
<p>but like basically also burned</p>
<p>until the people who are participating</p>
<p>go back up to two thirds</p>
<p>and then the chain goes back to finalizing.</p>
<p>So just seeing all of those edge cases play out live,</p>
<p>I think actually helped a lot</p>
<p>and probably helped to really contribute</p>
<p>to making us feel better about Mainnet.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s also an incident just recently</p>
<p>in April 24th of 2021</p>
<p>where this was on Beacon, I guess.</p>
<p>There was a bug discovered in the software client Prism</p>
<p>that prevented roughly 70% of validators</p>
<p>on the network from producing blocks.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you can comment on what happened,</p>
<p>but broadly like the big picture,</p>
<p>what kind of stuff are you worried about</p>
<p>in terms of problems that might arise?</p>
<p>Are we talking about small bugs?</p>
<p>Are we talking about like emergent social,</p>
<p>unexpected social bugs?</p>
<p>What are the things that worry you</p>
<p>about the future of Ethereum</p>
<p>that you want to make sure you construct mechanisms</p>
<p>that prevent those things from happening?</p>
<p>So one of the lucky things there was</p>
<p>that this particular bug only prevented</p>
<p>proposed self blocks.</p>
<p>It did not prevent attestations.</p>
<p>So attestations is just a mechanism for voting on blocks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the attestations that are actually responsible</p>
<p>for the chain finalizing.</p>
<p>So like coming to this more permanence agreements on blocks.</p>
<p>So the chain was actually quite stable all the way through.</p>
<p>I think the thing that we generally learned</p>
<p>from these experiences is just how valuable it is</p>
<p>to have this multi client network.</p>
<p>So this is one of these areas where I think Ethereum</p>
<p>distinguishes itself from like Bitcoin, for example.</p>
<p>That in Ethereum, we don&rsquo;t have one single client</p>
<p>that everyone just runs, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s multiple implementations of the protocol.</p>
<p>And these multiple implementations,</p>
<p>they all process and verify the blocks</p>
<p>that each other can verify, right?</p>
<p>So they all speak the same language.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes when there&rsquo;s a bug, they disagree.</p>
<p>And when two clients disagree because of a bug,</p>
<p>we call this a consensus failure.</p>
<p>And consensus failures are pretty serious, right?</p>
<p>And when you have a client&rsquo;s monoculture like Bitcoin does,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s more rare to have consensus failures.</p>
<p>Though you still have them actually.</p>
<p>Bitcoin had a consensus failure</p>
<p>between two different versions of the same client</p>
<p>back in 2013, but they&rsquo;re less likely to happen.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing is that the multi client</p>
<p>architecture has actually, I think, saved Ethereum</p>
<p>much more than it&rsquo;s heard it.</p>
<p>So even in this most recent incident, right?</p>
<p>Like Prism was not producing blocks,</p>
<p>but all the other clients were still producing blocks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s four others, right?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a Prism, Nimbus, Teku, and the Lighthouse.</p>
<p>And then also Ethereum back in 2016 had this fun events</p>
<p>that we call the Shanghai DOS attacks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called that because the attacks started</p>
<p>right on the first day of our annual conference at DEF CON</p>
<p>that happens to be in Shanghai that year.</p>
<p>So what happened basically was that someone came up</p>
<p>with a way to create blocks that were very slow</p>
<p>for one client to process, but not the other client.</p>
<p>So at that time, there were basically two Ethereum clients.</p>
<p>They were called Geth and Parity.</p>
<p>Right now, I think the top three ones are Geth,</p>
<p>Nethermind, and Basu.</p>
<p>But what happened as a result of us having two clients</p>
<p>is that the attacker was just not able to come up</p>
<p>with blocks that both clients were completely failing</p>
<p>at processing.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the miners and a lot of network participants,</p>
<p>they just kept on switching between the two implementations</p>
<p>depending on which one worked.</p>
<p>And that actually really helped the chain survive</p>
<p>through that month of attacks as the attacker just kept</p>
<p>on hammering at our system and identifying all</p>
<p>of the weaknesses and just forcing our clients</p>
<p>to do this rapid sprint of just optimizing the hell</p>
<p>out of everything and make sure there aren&rsquo;t any</p>
<p>of those DOS blocks or DOS bugs remaining.</p>
<p>So that was another example.</p>
<p>And then as a counter example,</p>
<p>so something that also shows the point from the other side,</p>
<p>Bitcoin had this bug in 2010, the balance overflow bug.</p>
<p>Basically someone created a transaction that had two outputs</p>
<p>and those outputs were both of a few billion Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So like about two to the power of 63 Satoshis.</p>
<p>And then if you add those numbers together,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go above two to the power of 64.</p>
<p>And of course, computers like once you go above</p>
<p>to the power of 64, you wrap around.</p>
<p>And so the Bitcoin nodes thought that there was enough money</p>
<p>to pay for the transaction because it was asking for,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say like a billion Satoshis or something,</p>
<p>but actually it was asking for two to the power</p>
<p>of 64 plus a billion.</p>
<p>And so the attacker just managed to create like billions</p>
<p>of Bitcoin out of thin air.</p>
<p>And this was not only discovered and fixed</p>
<p>after something like 12 hours,</p>
<p>but if there had been,</p>
<p>if Bitcoin had been a multiple implementation system,</p>
<p>then what would have almost certainly happened</p>
<p>is like one of the clients would have bugged out,</p>
<p>but the other clients would have probably</p>
<p>actually had a check for that, right?</p>
<p>And so there would have been a consensus failure,</p>
<p>but at least that would have like alerted everyone</p>
<p>that there is a problem very quickly.</p>
<p>And it also would have given everyone</p>
<p>just like obvious social permission to go and, you know,</p>
<p>pick whichever one of the chains is correct</p>
<p>and solve the problem.</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s, I think a big learning that we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>from multiple of our experiences in the Ethereum ecosystem,</p>
<p>just like validating this multi client model.</p>
<p>And like, to be fair,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a model that we get criticized for a lot, right?</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin people talk about, you know,</p>
<p>the risk of consensus failures that this creates.</p>
<p>VC types are like, well, you know,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it expensive and wasteful to fund three software teams</p>
<p>where you could just be making, you know,</p>
<p>one quote focused effort, you know,</p>
<p>they love the word focused.</p>
<p>And like, you know, Ethereum is not that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing despite not being that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Basically, yeah, so that was interesting.</p>
<p>And then there have definitely been other learnings as well,</p>
<p>just from like seeing the chain live</p>
<p>and seeing what actually is the staking experience like,</p>
<p>what are the actual incentives</p>
<p>for all the different participants.</p>
<p>So I definitely feel like we&rsquo;re gaining a lot</p>
<p>from this sort of one year of trial running the chain</p>
<p>before we actually make all of Ethereum depend on it.</p>
<p>Let me ask perhaps a strange question,</p>
<p>but you know, proponents of Bitcoin will say things like,</p>
<p>Bitcoin fixes everything.</p>
<p>So why do we need Ethereum?</p>
<p>Versus like Bitcoin plus lightning network for scalability</p>
<p>and then using Bitcoin for,</p>
<p>with this proof of work for security.</p>
<p>So in this kind of, it is perhaps sort of a strange question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a high level question.</p>
<p>Why do we need another technology?</p>
<p>Yes, it has a bunch of nice features,</p>
<p>but like doesn&rsquo;t Bitcoin fix everything already?</p>
<p>So the thing that always attracted me about Bitcoin</p>
<p>is these values of decentralization,</p>
<p>creating these open provisional systems</p>
<p>that anyone can participate in</p>
<p>and that aren&rsquo;t just going to flop over and die</p>
<p>if whoever created them gets bored</p>
<p>and that are resistant to like whoever runs them</p>
<p>breaking the rules and all of these things.</p>
<p>And I think that pretty strongly that these principles</p>
<p>are like really valid in importance</p>
<p>to much more things than just money, right?</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin is the blockchain for money</p>
<p>and Ethereum was built from the start</p>
<p>as a general purpose blockchain, right?</p>
<p>There is ether the asset on Ethereum,</p>
<p>but then you can also make decentralized financial things,</p>
<p>what we call DeFi today.</p>
<p>You can make like ENS, the decentralized domain name system.</p>
<p>You can put, make prediction markets on it.</p>
<p>You can make totally nonfinancial systems</p>
<p>that just like keep track of whether or not</p>
<p>some certificate was signed</p>
<p>or whether or not some like cryptographic key got revoked.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this big long list of like just interesting things</p>
<p>that you could use about blockchains to do, right?</p>
<p>Like basically they are sort of the missing piece</p>
<p>that where without them,</p>
<p>the kinds of things that a decentralized computer network</p>
<p>can do is very limited.</p>
<p>And once you have them,</p>
<p>a lot of those limitations end up going away.</p>
<p>And so Ethereum was like always from the beginning</p>
<p>about that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about like, hey, this isn&rsquo;t just money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more that you could do</p>
<p>if you could just go ahead and make any infrastructure</p>
<p>or digital institution or DAO</p>
<p>or whatever you wanna call it,</p>
<p>where the kind of the base layer of the logic</p>
<p>is just executed in this open and transparent way</p>
<p>where everyone can see what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>or if you like your zero knowledge proofs,</p>
<p>at least everyone can see proofs that prove to you</p>
<p>that what&rsquo;s going on follows the rules</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to just constantly keep trusting</p>
<p>centralized actors.</p>
<p>Hence the smart contracts</p>
<p>as being a sort of a core technology as part of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Smart contracts, the computer programs</p>
<p>that are running on Ethereum,</p>
<p>they are like the core</p>
<p>of what makes Ethereum general purpose.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I do think that there&rsquo;s a lot more wrong</p>
<p>with the world than just money, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not one of these people who thinks that</p>
<p>if you get rid of fiat currency</p>
<p>and you replace it with cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>then suddenly wars are gonna go away, right?</p>
<p>Because like, first of all,</p>
<p>like say your average revenue</p>
<p>is only a small portion of government revenue, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what, 5%, 10%, something like that.</p>
<p>Second of all, like if you are the sort of,</p>
<p>this is one of the things</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even get about their philosophy.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re the sort of person</p>
<p>who is an extreme and very distrusting libertarian</p>
<p>and you think that these governments are terrible, right?</p>
<p>Like we know today that governments</p>
<p>find a combination of things like welfare</p>
<p>and things like the military</p>
<p>that goes and like bombs people in Afghanistan, right?</p>
<p>And so the question you have to ask is like, okay,</p>
<p>you with your new, you know, magic newfangled cyber currency</p>
<p>that takes over the world,</p>
<p>take away the government&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to have seniorized revenue</p>
<p>and so you reduce the government&rsquo;s revenue by 10%.</p>
<p>If the government is that evil,</p>
<p>which portion of its expenses</p>
<p>is it gonna take that 10% from?</p>
<p>Is it gonna stop the bombing people in Afghanistan</p>
<p>or is it gonna cut welfare?</p>
<p>If you think it&rsquo;s the first,</p>
<p>you have a very optimistic view of the government, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I guess, my perspective</p>
<p>on like why the whole, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to save the world and create peace</p>
<p>by like denying governments the right</p>
<p>to stealth taxation kind of perspective</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really make much sense for me.</p>
<p>And I do think that there is real value</p>
<p>that comes from a decentralized and open currency.</p>
<p>Like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure</p>
<p>that anyone in the world can go ahead and use, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s something that can easily be</p>
<p>a big boon for people, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of places where the currency</p>
<p>and is much less stable than the dollar.</p>
<p>And, you know, these people like they don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>well, if they use Bitcoin,</p>
<p>their only option is to get Bitcoins, right?</p>
<p>Which, you know, are also pretty volatile.</p>
<p>If they use Ethereum, then, you know, they can get ether,</p>
<p>but then they can also get stable coins, right?</p>
<p>And you might think that, you know,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re not being ideologically pure.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re giving them stable coins,</p>
<p>which are mirroring dollars.</p>
<p>And obviously dollars are going to collapse too.</p>
<p>But the reality is that dollars are vastly more stable</p>
<p>than the Venezuelan Bolivar.</p>
<p>So like, there are really meaningful and beneficial things</p>
<p>that you can give to people by having a global</p>
<p>and open financial system.</p>
<p>But I think if you want to actually do that,</p>
<p>like you have to have much more than just a currency, right?</p>
<p>And then if you want to go beyond financial things,</p>
<p>then, you know, you have to obviously have much more</p>
<p>than a currency and then, you know,</p>
<p>you also have to actually take scalability seriously</p>
<p>because the nonfinancial applications,</p>
<p>like nobody&rsquo;s going to pay $5 a transaction for them.</p>
<p>Can we return to dogs?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Woof, woof.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>The other one&rsquo;s categorically forbidden.</p>
<p>Yeah, categorically forbidden.</p>
<p>Is there any cryptocurrency based on cats actually?</p>
<p>I think there are.</p>
<p>Like, there was cat coin, there was nan coin.</p>
<p>For some reason, they just didn&rsquo;t catch on as much</p>
<p>as the dog coins did.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about Dogecoin and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Elon said that, quote, ideally,</p>
<p>Doge speeds up block time 10x,</p>
<p>increases block size 10x, and drops fee 100x.</p>
<p>Then it wins hands down, end quote.</p>
<p>You said in a blog post, partially responding to that,</p>
<p>that there are subtle technical reasons</p>
<p>why this is not possible.</p>
<p>To this, Elon said that you, quote, fear the Doge.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>What are the technical hurdles for Dogecoin</p>
<p>that prevent it from becoming</p>
<p>one of the primary cryptocurrencies of the world?</p>
<p>And do you, in fact, fear the Doge?</p>
<p>I definitely feel obligated to correct the record.</p>
<p>I definitely do not fear the Doge.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, I love the Doge.</p>
<p>I actually visited the Doge in Japan a few years back.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an amazing dog, she&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>Wait, the original Doge?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So, you know, we accept Doge every year</p>
<p>for our annual DEF CON conferences.</p>
<p>So, I definitely don&rsquo;t think Ethereum</p>
<p>is opposed to Doge coins.</p>
<p>I kind of want to feel like Ethereum</p>
<p>is at least a little bit in spirit itself a Dogecoin.</p>
<p>And then, as I mentioned, I love Doge,</p>
<p>I bought a bunch of Doge, I still hold a bunch of Doge.</p>
<p>On the scalability question,</p>
<p>the challenge basically is the limits to scalability</p>
<p>and the trade offs with centralization, right?</p>
<p>If you just increase the parameters</p>
<p>without doing anything else,</p>
<p>then it just becomes more and more difficult</p>
<p>for people to validate the chain</p>
<p>and it just becomes more likely that the chain</p>
<p>becomes centralized and becomes vulnerable</p>
<p>to all kinds of capture.</p>
<p>So, does it need like some of the layer two technologies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about?</p>
<p>I personally think that if Doge wants to somehow bridge</p>
<p>through Ethereum and then people can trade Doge</p>
<p>thousands of times a second inside of a loop ring,</p>
<p>then that would be amazing.</p>
<p>If they want to just like take ZK roll up style technology</p>
<p>and just have thousands of transactions a second</p>
<p>on their own chain, then that would be a great outcome</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>So, is there ways for Ethereum and Dogecoin</p>
<p>to work together?</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a power behind a person like Elon Musk</p>
<p>pushing the development of a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Is there ways to leverage that power and that momentum</p>
<p>to improve Ethereum, to improve some of the sort of</p>
<p>cryptocurrencies that are already technologically advanced</p>
<p>and pushing forward that kind of technology?</p>
<p>I definitely think there&rsquo;s room for&hellip;</p>
<p>You know that meme of Doge like taking over,</p>
<p>like that storm?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Is there a way to ride that storm, that wave of the Doge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s taking over?</p>
<p>I think if we can have a secure Doge to Ethereum bridge,</p>
<p>then that would be amazing.</p>
<p>And then when Ethereum gets its scalability,</p>
<p>any scalability thing that works for Ethereum assets,</p>
<p>you would be able to also trade wrapped Doge</p>
<p>with extremely low transaction fees</p>
<p>and very high speed as well.</p>
<p>Is there precedence for building secure bridges</p>
<p>between cryptocurrencies?</p>
<p>Is that, I mean, how difficult is this kind of task?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely something that&rsquo;s in its infancy.</p>
<p>There definitely have been some cross chain interaction</p>
<p>things that have been done before.</p>
<p>So, the earliest is probably the concept of merge mining,</p>
<p>right, when a chain just makes its entire</p>
<p>proof of work algorithm dependent on</p>
<p>the proof of work algorithm of another chain.</p>
<p>So, I think famous Dogecoin actually merge mines</p>
<p>to Litecoin, which is, I think in retrospect,</p>
<p>not looking like a very good choice</p>
<p>because now Dogecoin is bigger than Litecoin.</p>
<p>But, you know, if there&rsquo;s potentially some way</p>
<p>for Dogecoin to merge mine with an Ethereum proof</p>
<p>of stake of some kinds,</p>
<p>then that could be an interesting alternative.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s one type of chain interaction.</p>
<p>As far as bridges, like one chain reading another chain,</p>
<p>early in Ethereum&rsquo;s history,</p>
<p>there was this project called BTC Relay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a smart contract on Ethereum</p>
<p>that just verifies Bitcoin blocks.</p>
<p>I think people stopped really caring about it</p>
<p>and maintaining it because there just weren&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>applications that were actually interested</p>
<p>in using it at the time.</p>
<p>And then the transaction fees got too high</p>
<p>to actually maintain it.</p>
<p>So, I think if we want to make a BTC Relay 2.0,</p>
<p>that becomes cheaper because, you know,</p>
<p>it uses snarks or something like that,</p>
<p>then you probably could.</p>
<p>But maybe now&rsquo;s the time when you actually</p>
<p>can do that sort of one way verification.</p>
<p>But the one challenge though,</p>
<p>is that if he wants to have a bridge</p>
<p>that allows you to move assets between chains,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t just need one way verification,</p>
<p>you need two way verification, right?</p>
<p>And Ethereum can verify anything</p>
<p>because Ethereum smart contracts</p>
<p>can just run arbitrary code.</p>
<p>But if you want Bitcoin to be able to do things</p>
<p>based on what happens in Ethereum lands,</p>
<p>then Bitcoin would have to basically,</p>
<p>well, they can do everything with soft forks</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s their religion,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll do it that way.</p>
<p>And if Doge wants to make a fork</p>
<p>where that allows for two way transferability</p>
<p>with Ethereum, then they could.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that would be a lovely collaboration</p>
<p>to make if there&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>I think there might actually even be some multi SIG funds</p>
<p>that has some funding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a bounty for someone</p>
<p>to make a bridge between the two.</p>
<p>Oh, could you maybe try to psychoanalyze Elon Musk</p>
<p>for a brief second?</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about Tesla and Elon Musk&rsquo;s</p>
<p>journey through the cryptocurrency world?</p>
<p>So first with Bitcoin and then with Dogecoin.</p>
<p>So acquiring, holding a large amount of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And I believe, at least considering the acquiring</p>
<p>and holding a large amount of Dogecoin.</p>
<p>Positives, negatives, what do you think the future</p>
<p>for Tesla and SpaceX in the cryptocurrency space looks like?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;ll consider Ethereum?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that if they stay in the cryptocurrency system</p>
<p>at all, then they have to at some point.</p>
<p>Bitcoin number one, Dogecoin number,</p>
<p>I mean, come on, it deserves to be number three.</p>
<p>And then, or number two.</p>
<p>And then Ethereum can be whatever that other number is.</p>
<p>If Ethereum only becomes a Dogecoin somehow,</p>
<p>maybe change the logo to incorporate a dog of some sort.</p>
<p>Almost like Doge sneaking behind.</p>
<p>Oh, that would be fascinating.</p>
<p>For when the merge happens.</p>
<p>And I think, Elon, you definitely,</p>
<p>I think you would make a mistake</p>
<p>if you were to kind of ascribe too much sophisticated,</p>
<p>malevolent, or any deep intentionality to the whole process.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s just a human being and he likes dogs,</p>
<p>just like I like dogs.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that is literally the reasoning</p>
<p>behind the whole Dogecoin thing.</p>
<p>There is some aspect to which,</p>
<p>I mean, the guy helped launch a car into space, right?</p>
<p>Like you could ask, like, what is the purpose of that?</p>
<p>I think the purpose of that is fun.</p>
<p>I think he truly is more and more, especially lately,</p>
<p>embodying the whole idea that the most entertaining outcome</p>
<p>is the most likely and he&rsquo;s fully embracing</p>
<p>the most entertaining outcome.</p>
<p>And in many ways, Dogecoin is the most</p>
<p>entertaining cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As cryptocurrency becomes more and more impactful</p>
<p>in the world, people are getting</p>
<p>more and more serious about it.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s selecting the cryptocurrency</p>
<p>that is the least serious and the most fun.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to that,</p>
<p>like coupling fun with technological sophistication</p>
<p>and somehow figuring out a way to do that well.</p>
<p>I want the world to be fun.</p>
<p>I think the world being fun is great.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask about a couple</p>
<p>of other technologies if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Chainlink</p>
<p>and hybrid smart contracts that utilize</p>
<p>off chain external data sources?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s definitely necessary for a smart contract</p>
<p>so that do a lot of things to use off chain data</p>
<p>of some kind, right?</p>
<p>Like if you want to have a stable coin,</p>
<p>you need a price oracle so you know</p>
<p>what price you&rsquo;re targeting.</p>
<p>If you want to have some fancy no crop insurance gadget,</p>
<p>like I think EtherRisk has been doing</p>
<p>a lot of good work with that.</p>
<p>And I think it was either Kenya or Sri Lanka or both,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re making a lot of good progress</p>
<p>in some of those places.</p>
<p>Like you need some kind of oracle to tell you,</p>
<p>did it actually rain in this particular area?</p>
<p>If he wants to have like assets that mirror</p>
<p>other financial assets, you need an oracle.</p>
<p>If you want to have a prediction market,</p>
<p>you need an oracle.</p>
<p>And so projects that provide oracles</p>
<p>are definitely really important.</p>
<p>There are definitely different kinds of use cases.</p>
<p>Like Augur is more about events</p>
<p>and the Augur oracle is designed,</p>
<p>I think differently from Chainlink, right?</p>
<p>Like Chainlink emphasizes the whole,</p>
<p>we have a fast automated thing</p>
<p>that just gives you data quickly.</p>
<p>Whereas Augur is more, we don&rsquo;t give a crap about speed.</p>
<p>And look, we don&rsquo;t need to give a crap about speed</p>
<p>because if you want to get your money out</p>
<p>on a prediction market that where in reality it&rsquo;s resolved,</p>
<p>you can probably just sell your coins for 99 cents anyway.</p>
<p>So I mean, I think Chainlink is definitely</p>
<p>taking a good and important part of the oracle design space.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m definitely happy that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that project taking the task on.</p>
<p>I mean, at the same time, I do think that</p>
<p>their frog army on Twitter can get a bit intense at times,</p>
<p>but like.</p>
<p>I mean, is there a way to incorporate</p>
<p>sort of oracle network type of ideas into Ethereum?</p>
<p>I personally would prefer the Ethereum base layer,</p>
<p>like stay away from trying to provide too much functionality</p>
<p>because like once you have the Ethereum base layer</p>
<p>making a claim about like say the US dollar</p>
<p>to Ethereum price, like at some sense,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically saying that like Ethereum</p>
<p>as a base platform starts making</p>
<p>what could be geopolitical statements, right?</p>
<p>Like for example, imagine if there was some civil war</p>
<p>and the US split up and you had two currencies</p>
<p>that both claims to be the US dollar,</p>
<p>well, Ethereum would have to pick one</p>
<p>for the sake of everyone who was already using that oracle.</p>
<p>So does that mean that the blockchain would be</p>
<p>taking a position in this big mega political debate?</p>
<p>So I think like for just those kinds of reasons,</p>
<p>I would personally like prefer Ethereum itself</p>
<p>to be more of this sort of pure platform</p>
<p>that just analyzes transactions</p>
<p>just mathematically using deterministic consensus rules.</p>
<p>And then if you need the oracles, that can be layer twos.</p>
<p>Like I think Ethereum like benefits</p>
<p>from not trying to do everything at layer one</p>
<p>and having this like very robust layer two ecosystem</p>
<p>where you have all these projects doing interesting things.</p>
<p>Yeah, focus on the basic technology avoid the politics.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Let me ask a bit of a human question.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, someone you&rsquo;ve worked with</p>
<p>in the early days of Ethereum,</p>
<p>there appears to my outsider view</p>
<p>to have been a bit of a falling out.</p>
<p>Is there positive inspiring human story</p>
<p>to be told about why you two parted ways?</p>
<p>I kind of want to let the various books</p>
<p>about Ethereum speak for themselves,</p>
<p>but I feel like since that time,</p>
<p>I think Charles has clearly progressed</p>
<p>and matured in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>And people who follow Charles closely</p>
<p>have definitely told me that like 2021 Charles</p>
<p>is very different from a 2014 Charles.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s 2021 Vitalik is much different</p>
<p>from 2014 Vitalik as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 Vitalik</p>
<p>and Charles look like as well.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Like the progression of the humans.</p>
<p>Is this going to be one of those things</p>
<p>where like everyone comes full circle</p>
<p>and then 2030 Vitalik and Charles are best friends?</p>
<p>Yeah, not necessarily best friends,</p>
<p>but some kind of are able to reminisce</p>
<p>in ways that puts some of the tension of the past behind.</p>
<p>I think such things are possible.</p>
<p>I think people definitely absolutely have a right to,</p>
<p>and I think should strive to just constantly change</p>
<p>and reinvent themselves.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about your thoughts</p>
<p>about the Cardano project that Charles Hoskinson leads?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve worked on some interesting ideas</p>
<p>that mirror some of the ideas in Ethereum,</p>
<p>proof of stake, working on smart contracts</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Is there something, again, positive,</p>
<p>inspiring that you could say?</p>
<p>Are they a competitor?</p>
<p>Is it complimentary technology?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely interesting ideas in there.</p>
<p>I do think Cardano takes a bit of a different approach</p>
<p>than Ethereum in that they really emphasize</p>
<p>having these big academic proofs for everything,</p>
<p>whereas Ethereum tends to be more okay with heuristic arguments</p>
<p>in part because it&rsquo;s just trying to do more faster.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s definitely very interesting things</p>
<p>that come out of IOHK research.</p>
<p>Can you comment on that kind of idea?</p>
<p>I, as sort of having a foot in research,</p>
<p>enjoy Charles&rsquo;s kind of emphasis on papers</p>
<p>and deep academic rigor.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of deep research rigor</p>
<p>in the world of cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually the sort of person</p>
<p>who thinks deep rigor is overrated.</p>
<p>The reason why I think deep rigor is overrated</p>
<p>is because I think in terms of why protocols fail,</p>
<p>I think the number of failures that are outside the model</p>
<p>is even more important, is bigger and more important</p>
<p>than the failures that are inside the model.</p>
<p>So if you take selfish mining, for example,</p>
<p>that original discovery from 2013</p>
<p>that showed how Bitcoin does,</p>
<p>even if it has a 50% fault tolerance,</p>
<p>assuming everyone&rsquo;s honest,</p>
<p>it only has a zero to 33% fault tolerance,</p>
<p>depending on your network model,</p>
<p>if you assume rational actors.</p>
<p>And to me, that was a great example</p>
<p>of an outside the model failure, right?</p>
<p>Because traditional consensus research,</p>
<p>just up until or before the blockchain days,</p>
<p>did not think about like incentivization much, right?</p>
<p>There was a little bit of thought about incentivization.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a couple of papers</p>
<p>on the Byzantine altruist rational model,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t that deep.</p>
<p>It was mostly operating under the assumption</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna make consensus</p>
<p>between 15 participants and these are institutions.</p>
<p>And if something goes wrong,</p>
<p>then we can figure out whether or not</p>
<p>it was deliberate offline.</p>
<p>And if they did something evil, we can sue them.</p>
<p>Whereas in the crypto world, you can&rsquo;t sue that, right?</p>
<p>And so that whole discovery basically arose</p>
<p>just because the model of traditional consensus research</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t cover those possibilities.</p>
<p>And then once you go out of the model,</p>
<p>those other issues do exist, right?</p>
<p>So, but then at the same time,</p>
<p>there definitely are protocols that turn out to be,</p>
<p>that do have failures inside the model.</p>
<p>Like this reminds me of the time</p>
<p>when I think I found a bug</p>
<p>in a proposed consensus implementation</p>
<p>from either BitShares or EOS.</p>
<p>This happened around the end of 2017.</p>
<p>So that was definitely inside the model</p>
<p>because like they had a very clear idea</p>
<p>of what they were trying to achieve.</p>
<p>They had a very clear description</p>
<p>and like there&rsquo;s a very clear mathematical argument</p>
<p>for why the description doesn&rsquo;t lead</p>
<p>to what they&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>But ultimately what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve</p>
<p>can never be fully described in formal language, right?</p>
<p>Like I think this is the big discovery of,</p>
<p>the AI safety people, for example, right?</p>
<p>Like just having a specification of what you want</p>
<p>is an insanely hard problem.</p>
<p>And like the more powerful the optimizer</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re giving the instructions to,</p>
<p>the more you have to be careful.</p>
<p>And so, I think there are the kind of these two sides.</p>
<p>And then the other thing is that</p>
<p>a lot of the academic approach ends up</p>
<p>basically optimizing for other people</p>
<p>inside of the academic system.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t really optimize for like curious outsiders.</p>
<p>Whereas like I personally totally optimize</p>
<p>for curious outsiders, or at least I feel like I strive to.</p>
<p>So I guess like that&rsquo;s my case for why I like</p>
<p>tends to behave in ways that, you know,</p>
<p>occasionally traditional academic types</p>
<p>criticize as being reckless.</p>
<p>But I mean, on the other hand, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely real benefits that come from</p>
<p>like just taking a rigorous approach,</p>
<p>especially when, you know, you know what the thing,</p>
<p>like, you know what the specification is</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to get.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re trying to kind of improve your ways</p>
<p>or provide protocols that actually provide that.</p>
<p>And like, you know exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>I feel like realistically, you probably wants to do</p>
<p>both kinds of analysis.</p>
<p>And like, sometimes you even want to do</p>
<p>both kinds of analysis in stages, right?</p>
<p>Like you have, you want to do more quick and dirty things</p>
<p>and even wants public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff.</p>
<p>And then later on you formalize it more</p>
<p>and then you get more feedback.</p>
<p>Like in general, I guess I feel like the norms of research</p>
<p>in the future, like the internet has just changed so much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that it&rsquo;s not going.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s even changed like collaboration structures</p>
<p>and like the patterns in which we work with each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that the correct structure</p>
<p>for collaborative research is the same</p>
<p>as what it was 15 years ago.</p>
<p>But like, what combination of these existing components</p>
<p>and of new ideas it is, like that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, totally legitimate</p>
<p>to kind of fight it out.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s great that there&rsquo;s different ecosystems</p>
<p>that have different attitudes to things.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I think, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big possibility that, you know,</p>
<p>things that the Ethereum,</p>
<p>ways that the Ethereum ecosystem approaches some problems</p>
<p>is totally wrong.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s other ecosystems with different principles</p>
<p>and they do well, that&rsquo;s something that we can learn from.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the depth for a search,</p>
<p>can you comment on AI safety?</p>
<p>And some people are really worried</p>
<p>about the existential risks of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say that&rsquo;s hopeful</p>
<p>about how we avoid in the same kind of line of reasoning</p>
<p>about creating formal models versus kind of looking</p>
<p>outside the model into what the real world actually is like?</p>
<p>Is there some lessons from that we can take</p>
<p>and map onto the AI safety world</p>
<p>where the potentials of the technology,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in autonomous weapon systems</p>
<p>or just the paperclip problem</p>
<p>that we can avoid AI destroying the world?</p>
<p>So my impression is actually that, like,</p>
<p>this is more of a kind of far away impression</p>
<p>and it could be wrong, that it might even be</p>
<p>that one of the challenges is that AI is not formal enough.</p>
<p>Like, because AI is very practitioner oriented, right?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s all about like, hey, I found a couple of hacks</p>
<p>and look, I ran them and look,</p>
<p>they seem to improve classification accuracy</p>
<p>from 0.684 to 0.773.</p>
<p>So a lot of the time there just isn&rsquo;t actual science behind</p>
<p>why this hack works and why this other hack doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You just sort of like trial and error your way into it.</p>
<p>And I could see how that approach works,</p>
<p>but at the same time, like,</p>
<p>that approach is not good for eligibility, for example.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not good for like understanding</p>
<p>what the heck is actually going on,</p>
<p>like how these kinds of systems conceivably might fail.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s even, you know, a debate on like,</p>
<p>can you take GPT3 like things and just scale them up</p>
<p>and their intelligence will continue to improve</p>
<p>or is there just like some types of reasoning</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re fundamentally bad at</p>
<p>and like they&rsquo;re not gonna get good at it</p>
<p>no matter how much you like scale this exact same approach</p>
<p>and add more hardware to it.</p>
<p>So having like thinking about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>more explicitly, I mean, my understanding</p>
<p>is that a big part of AI safety research</p>
<p>is trying to do that sort of stuff, right?</p>
<p>Formalize.</p>
<p>Yeah, formalize, try to improve just AI eligibility,</p>
<p>like trying to understand, you know,</p>
<p>if the AI makes some classification</p>
<p>so we can actually see like what happens</p>
<p>and like what&rsquo;s going on in the middle, right?</p>
<p>Whereas with crypto or with traditional cryptography,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like very much not,</p>
<p>well, okay, I mean, I shouldn&rsquo;t quite say that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, traditional cryptography is this interesting mix</p>
<p>of being very formal and being very informal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very formal with,</p>
<p>given these security assumptions,</p>
<p>prove that the protocol works</p>
<p>under these security assumptions.</p>
<p>The places where it&rsquo;s very informal is like,</p>
<p>well, how do we even know that there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>an efficient algorithm for factoring numbers?</p>
<p>Yeah, we kind of tried it for 40 years.</p>
<p>And then, you know, so far,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s found anything better</p>
<p>than the general number field sieve.</p>
<p>And like, okay, fine, we&rsquo;ll just assume it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You know, how do we know you can&rsquo;t find the discrete log</p>
<p>between two elliptic curve points?</p>
<p>Like, nope, did it a couple of decades,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s found anything faster</p>
<p>than like baby step, giant step stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and like, there&rsquo;s definitely ways</p>
<p>in which that approach really makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Because at least you can concentrate your analysis</p>
<p>on a small number of building blocks.</p>
<p>And like, you know, you do have some intuitive reasoning</p>
<p>about those building blocks,</p>
<p>but like at least there is a small number</p>
<p>of building blocks and lots of people are looking at them.</p>
<p>And then everything else just sort of gets formally built</p>
<p>on top and you actually can like mathematically reduce</p>
<p>the security of big things to building blocks, right?</p>
<p>Like you can have mathematical proofs</p>
<p>that say, you know, if you make a ZK Synarch</p>
<p>of a yes statement when in reality that statement is false,</p>
<p>then you can use that to like extract information</p>
<p>out of elliptic curves that, you know,</p>
<p>it completely breaks the problem or something like that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So ZK Synarch is an example where formalism is beneficial.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>And so maybe you can have the same kind of stuff</p>
<p>in the AI safety within AI systems</p>
<p>that you can get a hold of some kind of aspect</p>
<p>of the systems that you can control provably.</p>
<p>And then in blockchains and cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>I think the one area where consensus mechanisms</p>
<p>is still more an art than a science</p>
<p>is that these aren&rsquo;t just like technological systems,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re crypto economic systems, right?</p>
<p>And they make assumptions about people.</p>
<p>And which assumptions you can make about people</p>
<p>is not something that you can prove with math.</p>
<p>Right, even just the basic 51%.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Honest.</p>
<p>Can you trust the 51%?</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t trust the 51%,</p>
<p>can you trust the other 49% to be able to coordinate</p>
<p>on like making their own fork?</p>
<p>What will happen to coin prices?</p>
<p>Like how do people as human beings react to these events?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s all of these assumptions.</p>
<p>But no, at the same time,</p>
<p>look, if you can write down the assumptions,</p>
<p>then you can like do formal things with them.</p>
<p>I almost forgot to ask you</p>
<p>about one of the most exciting aspects of Ethereum.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s non technical.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a societal, it&rsquo;s social, which is NFTs.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the explosion of NFTs</p>
<p>in the recent months, especially in the art world</p>
<p>and beyond, and what does the future look like?</p>
<p>So this is maybe the social impact on the world,</p>
<p>on the individual creators of all kinds.</p>
<p>Like is that something you&rsquo;ve actually expected to see,</p>
<p>NFTs having this kind of impact?</p>
<p>And beyond, what do you think will happen</p>
<p>in the digital space with NFTs,</p>
<p>in virtual reality, in gaming, all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>I was definitely surprised by like NFTs in particular.</p>
<p>Like I even actually think might be on record somewhere</p>
<p>on some tech conference panel.</p>
<p>Like they were asking, you know,</p>
<p>it was one of those overrated or underrated sections</p>
<p>and ask about NFTs and I thought,</p>
<p>and I said like, hey, I think NFTs are overrated.</p>
<p>And, you know, in retrospect,</p>
<p>that turned out to be quite wrong.</p>
<p>I think, like, I guess I just personally</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really relate to this concept</p>
<p>of like spending a lot of money on a thing.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s nothing, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no clear kind of understanding</p>
<p>of why that thing would maintain its value.</p>
<p>Uniqueness of a thing having value.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, I definitely like cannot really understand,</p>
<p>you know, the psychology behind like buying,</p>
<p>you know, paying $200,000 for original art painting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, you know, if I had a mansion,</p>
<p>just like give me photocopies of everything.</p>
<p>You can hang three photocopies of the Mona Lisa section.</p>
<p>Why would I even have the Mona Lisa?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d probably just like have some Nyan Cats</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing where mathematics</p>
<p>or theoretical computer science cannot formalize</p>
<p>why the heck NFTs are valuable.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But the thing that makes me very happy about the space</p>
<p>now that it has happened is that,</p>
<p>and this gets back to the conversation</p>
<p>that we had at the beginning, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m interested in this concept</p>
<p>of decentralized public goods funding, right?</p>
<p>Like I want things that are good and valuable</p>
<p>to as much as possible also be things</p>
<p>that can economically sustain the people</p>
<p>who produce them, right?</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>then either the public goods just don&rsquo;t get produced at all</p>
<p>or people make like centralized versions</p>
<p>that have some of the properties and try to be substitutes,</p>
<p>but actually just like concentrate control</p>
<p>in a very small group, right?</p>
<p>And both of those things are not very nice.</p>
<p>So the nice thing about NFTs would be,</p>
<p>well, if you&rsquo;re an artist and you can just mint NFTs</p>
<p>and this is a source of revenue,</p>
<p>then like great, that&rsquo;s another stream of revenue</p>
<p>for creative work that often does still get underfunded</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask you a weird question.</p>
<p>We talked about Craig Wright a little bit,</p>
<p>but a lot of people write to me, one of two emails.</p>
<p>One email is calling any coin outside of Bitcoin a scam</p>
<p>and then the other email is saying,</p>
<p>my favorite coin is the best coin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to save the world, whatever that coin is.</p>
<p>And so I sit back and I look, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I try to figure out like the humans that I trust</p>
<p>in this space, just the basic human qualities,</p>
<p>but do you think some coins are scams?</p>
<p>Do you think some coins, maybe another way to ask it,</p>
<p>are scamier than other coins?</p>
<p>How are people that are looking outside of this space</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s all of these cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>supposed to figure out what is a scam and not,</p>
<p>or how to use the right kind of language</p>
<p>when talking about them?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s the harshness of the language</p>
<p>from the Bitcoin maximalists that doesn&rsquo;t just say</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s a scam, including Ethereum,</p>
<p>but they use terms like shit coin</p>
<p>that says it&rsquo;s not only a scam, it&rsquo;s like a waste of time.</p>
<p>I mean, every word you can use, they say that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very harsh.</p>
<p>And then some people just apply the word scam</p>
<p>much, much more conservatively and just refer to coins</p>
<p>that legitimately are trying to scam people</p>
<p>out of their money as scams.</p>
<p>So what do we do with this word scam?</p>
<p>Should it ever be applied to coins?</p>
<p>And is it a binary thing or is it a gray area?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s definitely a gray area.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely things that are really and actually scams.</p>
<p>I mean, Bitconnect would be one example</p>
<p>of something that&rsquo;s way on the scam spectrum.</p>
<p>Did you see their 2017 promotional video, by the way?</p>
<p>Of Bitconnect?</p>
<p>Yeah, hey, hey, hey, what&rsquo;s up, what&rsquo;s up, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>Bitconnect!</p>
<p>It was this three minute, 48 second video</p>
<p>that was just of this guy making this totally crazy rant.</p>
<p>And it was at some conference in Vietnam</p>
<p>where they were, of course, trying to convince</p>
<p>a whole bunch of people to buy this coin</p>
<p>and they had these claims about how it would go up in value.</p>
<p>That was definitely the peak of these pure,</p>
<p>completely scammy coins.</p>
<p>And that was definitely really terrible.</p>
<p>And I feel like we have less,</p>
<p>despite cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger,</p>
<p>we actually have quite a bit less of that now.</p>
<p>But then, of course, there&rsquo;s this spectrum</p>
<p>of things that are not completely scams</p>
<p>and then things that are not scams</p>
<p>and that are technically totally fine projects</p>
<p>but where their community is just incredibly sketchy</p>
<p>and then all the way to things</p>
<p>that are where the community is nice</p>
<p>but maybe the project is just fundamentally incapable</p>
<p>of achieving what it&rsquo;s trying to do</p>
<p>or in the community doesn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>and then really good projects, right?</p>
<p>So if you wanna go a step,</p>
<p>like if that&rsquo;s 100% scam,</p>
<p>then what would I call say 80% scam?</p>
<p>Well, like Bitcoin SV is one example.</p>
<p>This is a Craig Wright&rsquo;s fork of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it&rsquo;s a blockchain, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fork of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It has some 512 megabyte blocks.</p>
<p>If you really wanted to, you could use the blockchain.</p>
<p>It satisfies the property</p>
<p>so that you can send transactions onto it.</p>
<p>You can probably use it as a backup</p>
<p>to store your files if you really wanted to</p>
<p>just because it has so much space.</p>
<p>It might fail, but at the same time,</p>
<p>as we basically said, Craig Wright is a scammer</p>
<p>and half the community is just totally batshit insane.</p>
<p>So the humans of a particular cryptocurrency</p>
<p>is what makes for a scam and not like the humans at the top</p>
<p>that have a voice guiding the community.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think in the case of BSV,</p>
<p>the humans, they make just completely wrong</p>
<p>and just obviously wrong claims</p>
<p>about what BSV is capable of accomplishing</p>
<p>and what it can say we could accomplish.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just a lot of aspects of it</p>
<p>that make it feel like a money grab.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>And then you gotta go a bit further</p>
<p>and then you have the trons of the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a platform, you can use it,</p>
<p>you can do stuff on it.</p>
<p>But at the same time, they did plagiarize the IPFS white paper</p>
<p>and then they&hellip;</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s scammy qualities.</p>
<p>See, the thing that throws me off a lot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult for me, is that most coins,</p>
<p>but the ones that make me feel like are scammy</p>
<p>have a large community of people</p>
<p>that are super positive about it.</p>
<p>Like, and they&rsquo;ll write to me.</p>
<p>Now that said, sort of on the flip side of that,</p>
<p>Bitcoin people are also very positive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some sense in&hellip;</p>
<p>The reason I was having like squinty eyes</p>
<p>looking at Bitcoin for quite a while</p>
<p>is like, why is everyone so positive?</p>
<p>I was getting total cult vibes.</p>
<p>Like the ideas are not grounded in truth,</p>
<p>but are grounded in an obsession</p>
<p>of like when you can artificially conjure up a truth,</p>
<p>which is why I was a little bit like worried about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve learned a lot since then</p>
<p>to where like, I learned to separate the community</p>
<p>from the ideas.</p>
<p>And I think Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea on many fronts,</p>
<p>but still a community that&rsquo;s like dogmatically excited</p>
<p>about something, whatever that is, makes me skeptical.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just like my upbringing,</p>
<p>but when everybody&rsquo;s really excited about something,</p>
<p>it makes me skeptical.</p>
<p>But it also makes me difficult to decide</p>
<p>what is this scam or not,</p>
<p>because some of the most exciting ideas in this world</p>
<p>have a community of people who are excited about it, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think space exploration is super exciting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people, I know a lot of them</p>
<p>that are exceptionally excited about space exploration.</p>
<p>Does that mean it&rsquo;s a scam?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>And so most I just try to stay away, I suppose,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unfortunate because I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of exciting technologies in that space.</p>
<p>Like in the case of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>like I would definitely not call Bitcoin a scam.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I would also not call Litecoin a scam.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who call Litecoin a scam</p>
<p>because they just like say, oh, look,</p>
<p>it has no fundamental use case.</p>
<p>And the concept of being silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold</p>
<p>is just like stupid.</p>
<p>And like milli Bitcoin is the silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold.</p>
<p>But at the same time, like if you have these people</p>
<p>who just, they do seem to earnestly believe this.</p>
<p>And like they&rsquo;re trying to just like make Litecoin</p>
<p>be a Litecoin as best as they can.</p>
<p>Then like, to me that&rsquo;s enough for it to not be a scam.</p>
<p>And then, so yeah, I think the biggest gray area</p>
<p>is definitely between like projects that are earnest</p>
<p>but they have just all sorts of these</p>
<p>like different combinations of flawed qualities to them.</p>
<p>I mean, the ones that legitimately is a scam</p>
<p>is when the key people that are at the head of the project</p>
<p>are intentionally lying.</p>
<p>And I think as long as the intent</p>
<p>is to try to do good in the world,</p>
<p>even if your actual implementation of that is flawed,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not a scam.</p>
<p>It could be flawed ideas, it could be wrong ideas,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a scam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning to navigate this space.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely a very challenging space</p>
<p>to navigate, I mean, it&rsquo;s in some ways</p>
<p>the reflection of the world at large.</p>
<p>Yeah, and as we&rsquo;ve said, maybe offline</p>
<p>that the fact that money is involved</p>
<p>makes it a little bit more complicated</p>
<p>that lives can be ruined by the choice of technologies</p>
<p>that are taken on.</p>
<p>So it makes it more real, more painful,</p>
<p>more like elevated the impact of this.</p>
<p>Like imagine like Mac versus PC wars</p>
<p>if everyone who bought a MacBook had 10 Apple shares</p>
<p>inside of it, and everyone who had a PC</p>
<p>had 10 Microsoft shares inside of it.</p>
<p>And then you had the elites who bought their Macs</p>
<p>back in 1983, and then they spent $500 debt,</p>
<p>and now they have $40 million,</p>
<p>and they just think that they&rsquo;re these gurus</p>
<p>who understands the future of finance and geopolitics,</p>
<p>and they make theories about why Apple is the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna bring freedom to the world,</p>
<p>and Windows is secretly allied with the axis of evil.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is so brilliant.</p>
<p>So I think the right way to think about this</p>
<p>is we map some of the cryptocurrency battles</p>
<p>into the space of like EMAX versus VIM,</p>
<p>or Apple versus PC, if there were some stock</p>
<p>that came along with each implementation of each PC,</p>
<p>each Mac, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>This is 100% correct, 100% correct.</p>
<p>Because then that really energizes the armies</p>
<p>of people debating over this in a way</p>
<p>that something without money does not.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask you about something really fascinating</p>
<p>that you are also excited about, which is longevity,</p>
<p>antiaging.</p>
<p>You have donated money to the SENS Foundation,</p>
<p>so you have an interest in this whole space</p>
<p>of lifespan research.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your vision here?</p>
<p>Or what do you hope to see in antiaging</p>
<p>and longevity research?</p>
<p>I think I hope to see the concept</p>
<p>of seeing your parents and grandparents die</p>
<p>just slowly disappear from the public consciousness</p>
<p>as an experience that happens</p>
<p>over the course of half a century,</p>
<p>the same way that getting lost in a city</p>
<p>slowly disappeared over the public consciousness</p>
<p>over the last 50 now that we have smartphones.</p>
<p>The thing you have from Nick Bostrom,</p>
<p>the essay pinned in your Twitter argues</p>
<p>that essentially death is almost unethical.</p>
<p>The fact that we don&rsquo;t do something about this thing that,</p>
<p>this, in the essay, is a dragon</p>
<p>that keeps murdering everybody around us,</p>
<p>including our parents and grandparents,</p>
<p>is, the fact that we don&rsquo;t try to do something aggressively</p>
<p>about that dragon doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>So you think this is a battle worth fighting,</p>
<p>a battle for immortality, or at least longevity?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say absolutely.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say a battle where we really have started</p>
<p>over the last five years in particular</p>
<p>to see the first cracks of humanity</p>
<p>starting to make things that look like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll turn into victories.</p>
<p>Do you think humans can eventually live forever?</p>
<p>And maybe as a side comment to that,</p>
<p>what technology do you think will enable that</p>
<p>as a genetic modification?</p>
<p>Is it cloning, is it uploading your mind?</p>
<p>Define forever, like are we talking 1,000 years,</p>
<p>a million, 10 to the 14, 10 to the 45?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start, as I tweeted today,</p>
<p>eventually everything, the universe will be filled</p>
<p>with supermassive black holes.</p>
<p>So that forever, maybe like backtracking to where.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have 10 to the 16 years to figure it out.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe travel between the multiverse,</p>
<p>between the different universes of the multiverse.</p>
<p>I mean, but forever meaning like, you know, millennia.</p>
<p>I definitely think that we can get there.</p>
<p>I definitely think that it&rsquo;s the sort of thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to take an insanely huge amount of work.</p>
<p>And I definitely think it&rsquo;s the sort of thing</p>
<p>where once we figure out the first crop of problems</p>
<p>and like people start living to 150,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just realize that there&rsquo;s like 10 other problems</p>
<p>that kill you half as slowly and we&rsquo;ll have to do more work.</p>
<p>But the good news is that this is Aubrey&rsquo;s longevity</p>
<p>escape velocity argument that if you get everyone</p>
<p>to live to 150 now, then you have half a century</p>
<p>to fix all those other problems as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m optimistic for that reason.</p>
<p>I think you definitely do not want to underestimate</p>
<p>human ingenuity, especially over the longterm.</p>
<p>Like just to look at what happens to computers</p>
<p>between the ENIAC in 1950 and we&rsquo;re around 2020, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a span of 70 years.</p>
<p>So like, you know, both of us, I think,</p>
<p>with just present day technology,</p>
<p>I have like at least 70 more years to live.</p>
<p>So just like imagine what kind of sea change</p>
<p>will happen in biomedicine during that time.</p>
<p>And the other thing that made me optimistic</p>
<p>is that I actually think COVID has been this kind of event</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really kind of pushed biomedicine</p>
<p>and especially like activist approaches to biomedicine</p>
<p>really into the public consciousness, right?</p>
<p>Like it basically, it&rsquo;s put people into this mindset</p>
<p>that, you know, wait, but like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just like, you know, the bits and tweets</p>
<p>that are gonna save the world, you know,</p>
<p>the bio is actually like super important and huge.</p>
<p>And, you know, ultimately what&rsquo;s ending COVID basically,</p>
<p>you know, is the vaccines</p>
<p>and the vaccines have just been, you know, amazing.</p>
<p>And if you can take that energy and also like this,</p>
<p>I think philosophical attitude that I&rsquo;ve noticed,</p>
<p>like the way that I would describe</p>
<p>the philosophical attitude here,</p>
<p>this is going more depth first,</p>
<p>is that I think the way that I kind of interpret</p>
<p>part of what I would call late 20th century ideology</p>
<p>is that there is this mentality that, you know,</p>
<p>nature is good and disruptions from nature are bad</p>
<p>and generally you wanna minimize disruptions from nature.</p>
<p>And like this exists everywhere in the political spectrum.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nature as in literal nature.</p>
<p>And my view is that like the right wing version of that</p>
<p>is markets as nature, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, the way that like that kind of philosophy</p>
<p>talks about, you know, markets</p>
<p>and like the goal of not interfering with them,</p>
<p>like, you know, it is very kind of like nature styled.</p>
<p>And then of course, you know, the conservative one,</p>
<p>which is like traditional culture that existed</p>
<p>before the activists started controlling everything</p>
<p>as also being a kind of nature.</p>
<p>But the 21st century attitude and like really COVID,</p>
<p>you know, has flipped a lot of minds</p>
<p>because with COVID what&rsquo;s happened is that,</p>
<p>well, no, like it&rsquo;s not, nature is not safe, right?</p>
<p>The default is that is like, you know, untold misery</p>
<p>and suffering in tens of millions of people dying.</p>
<p>The only way out for us is through</p>
<p>like basically human ingenuity.</p>
<p>And that frame of mind is one that&rsquo;s like much more friendly</p>
<p>to one, this other change of minds that I want to see,</p>
<p>which is like basically treating aging</p>
<p>as an engineering problem, right?</p>
<p>Like the default is all 7.8 billion human beings</p>
<p>that are currently on this earth are gonna die</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna live their last decade of life</p>
<p>in debilitating pain.</p>
<p>And the only way to stop that is human ingenuity.</p>
<p>And, you know, we don&rsquo;t have that solution yet,</p>
<p>but, you know, if we work hard, we will.</p>
<p>And more and more people on the biology side,</p>
<p>computational biology are basically converting</p>
<p>the mess of the human biology into an engineering problem.</p>
<p>And once that conversion is happening,</p>
<p>looking at the genetic code, the proteins,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things, once that conversion happens,</p>
<p>you can now apply the tools that we know</p>
<p>how to solve engineering problems to solving it that way.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also the other version, which is, you know,</p>
<p>why do we romanticize this meat vehicle</p>
<p>that ultimately is just the thing that carries the brain,</p>
<p>maybe we can more and more convert ourselves</p>
<p>into the digital realm.</p>
<p>This is where like Neuralink have the computer interfaces</p>
<p>and then achieve immortality in the space of information</p>
<p>and the digital space versus the biology space.</p>
<p>That stuff&rsquo;s interesting too, I agree.</p>
<p>Again, I think, you know, we have enough resources</p>
<p>and we should just try all the parallel tracks.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s great that we have people</p>
<p>just trying to make our bodies work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that we have people trying to upload</p>
<p>or improve brain scanning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also great that we have just like people</p>
<p>improving cryonics.</p>
<p>So like we could just like, you know,</p>
<p>go to sleep in the freezer and eventually,</p>
<p>hopefully sometime in the future, you know,</p>
<p>Hal Finney is gonna be able to wake up,</p>
<p>all of this, you know, anyone who gets cryo chronically</p>
<p>frozen today will be able to wake up,</p>
<p>but you know, that&rsquo;s a bet, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last resort.</p>
<p>And then the other interesting thing</p>
<p>about the like extreme uploading approach, right,</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re excited about space.</p>
<p>And one of the points that a lot of science</p>
<p>or like hard science fiction types make</p>
<p>is that, you know, if you want to explore space,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot easier if you&rsquo;re not a human, right?</p>
<p>Like one example of this is that, you know,</p>
<p>in the context of humans, we&rsquo;re talking about like,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re gonna be able to go to the moon,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re gonna be able to go to Mars,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this project called Starshot, I believe, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically trying to send spacecraft</p>
<p>to mini spacecrafts to Alpha Centauri,</p>
<p>and they literally believe that they&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to get spacecraft over to Alpha Centauri</p>
<p>like four light years away by like the 2060s.</p>
<p>Now, I mean.</p>
<p>By traveling close to the speed of light, yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly, like, so the way it works is, you know,</p>
<p>you have these light sails,</p>
<p>like you basically take these a spacecraft</p>
<p>and you shine a laser at it,</p>
<p>and the laser is insanely strong,</p>
<p>quickly accelerated at a hundred Gs or,</p>
<p>no, I think it was 10,000 Gs</p>
<p>until it gets to 20% of the speed of light,</p>
<p>and then, you know, it goes on your merry way, right?</p>
<p>So if you wants to be in,</p>
<p>like personally explore the Alpha Centauri system</p>
<p>within like two centuries or one century,</p>
<p>then, you know, being a robot is like,</p>
<p>by far the most practical way to do it,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no way that a human being</p>
<p>can survive 10,000 Gs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely interesting longterm,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a lot of like psychological hangups</p>
<p>and a lot of like deep philosophy</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll just have to grapple with to get there.</p>
<p>I think what it hangs on the topic</p>
<p>of whether we can convert consciousness</p>
<p>into an engineering problem.</p>
<p>So like, is consciousness tied to our biology?</p>
<p>Because the moment we can convert consciousness</p>
<p>into a digital form,</p>
<p>then we can send it with that light sail</p>
<p>to Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p>Until then, a robot is not carrying anything</p>
<p>except maybe some basic knowledge like Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not carrying the flame of human consciousness.</p>
<p>I have high hopes for converting consciousness</p>
<p>into an engineering problem.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it&rsquo;s not as difficult as people think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely in the camp that consciousness</p>
<p>is a property of the algorithm</p>
<p>and not a property of a brain structure.</p>
<p>The other fun, like the kinds of philosophical things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have to grapple with is like,</p>
<p>once you upload yourself, like you can hit Control C,</p>
<p>you know, like it wouldn&rsquo;t be lovely</p>
<p>to have like 10 copies of Alex Friedman</p>
<p>and then like we could just interview everyone.</p>
<p>So this is, I mean, this is, I have to ask this question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult one,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be wonderful, first of all.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So in the following way,</p>
<p>and this has to do with immortality as well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about scarcity that creates value.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a bunch of philosophers,</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl, Bernard Williams, Ernest Becker,</p>
<p>they argue that death or the scarcity of life</p>
<p>creates meaning.</p>
<p>The reason we, life is beautiful,</p>
<p>the reason so many moments of experience</p>
<p>of love or delicious food,</p>
<p>all those things are made delicious</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re finite, because they end,</p>
<p>and because we don&rsquo;t have that many of them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a kind of worry</p>
<p>that if we extend the human lifespan,</p>
<p>if we achieve immortality, or if we, God forbid,</p>
<p>clone me multiple times,</p>
<p>then you lose the richness of what it means</p>
<p>to have this life, to have this experience.</p>
<p>Is that worry you at all?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some aspect</p>
<p>to which death does in fact give meaning to life?</p>
<p>I guess like the one historical parallel,</p>
<p>and this might be a bit unfair,</p>
<p>is that there have been philosophers</p>
<p>that have said things like,</p>
<p>war gives meaning to human collectives,</p>
<p>and the struggle for supremacy between nations and races</p>
<p>is this big driver of progress</p>
<p>that ensures that everyone strives to be their best.</p>
<p>And of course, this viewpoint got into the head</p>
<p>of a crazy Austrian guy, and 20 years later,</p>
<p>his soldiers were shooting at my grandparents.</p>
<p>So these days we don&rsquo;t really have that,</p>
<p>but yet life still feels meaningful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve still found other ways to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a striving for technological progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a striving for self improvements in general.</p>
<p>And it turns out that you don&rsquo;t actually need</p>
<p>to have existential conflicts in order to have that.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you need conflict,</p>
<p>but we have other kinds of conflict, right?</p>
<p>Like we have competition between businesses,</p>
<p>competition between political ideologies,</p>
<p>competition between projects.</p>
<p>And so these are, like whatever the psychological needs are,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re just our substitutes for it.</p>
<p>So I guess like, yeah, so if we trying to say,</p>
<p>I feel like once we start living to the age of 200,</p>
<p>then like, I&rsquo;m just intuitively expecting</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll see substitutes emerge in the same way.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll create conflicts of other sorts</p>
<p>that lead to less human suffering than wars do.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ll just start playing Diablo four, five, six,</p>
<p>cause you die in video games.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll get some of the inkling of scarcity</p>
<p>through the activities we partake in</p>
<p>as opposed to our own body dying.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel shitty when I, like you can,</p>
<p>I remember in Diablo three, you can play in hardcore mode</p>
<p>where if you die in the game, your character&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get the richness that we currently get from life</p>
<p>by having like little artificial versions</p>
<p>of ourselves that die.</p>
<p>Interesting enough, as I&rsquo;ve just like personally</p>
<p>spent more time in this world, I&rsquo;ve started realizing</p>
<p>that there is a concept of like real finiteness</p>
<p>that still exists and it might even still be a thing</p>
<p>that provides meaning that doesn&rsquo;t require anyone</p>
<p>to actually die.</p>
<p>Like for example, like how many people from middle school</p>
<p>or even high school are yours?</p>
<p>Like do you still talk to regularly?</p>
<p>I happen to be close friends with like four or five of them.</p>
<p>Okay, well, like in my case, the answer is zero</p>
<p>for middle school and two for high school.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It dropped close to zero.</p>
<p>Exactly, it dropped a lot, right?</p>
<p>And so like there&rsquo;s a lot of these just like relationships</p>
<p>that end up being very finite.</p>
<p>A person changes their, I feel like a person changes enough</p>
<p>of their worldview after 25 years.</p>
<p>Was there even a study about this?</p>
<p>Something like a person and themselves 25 years later</p>
<p>are about as different as like two different people</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>So, I mean, just like you can have conflict</p>
<p>without bloodshed, I think you can have finiteness</p>
<p>and even the necessary sorrows of finiteness</p>
<p>that give meaning without like literally anyone</p>
<p>having to end their life.</p>
<p>And hopefully if we do extend our life,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll figure out ways to extend the period of time</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s neuroplasticity</p>
<p>to where we could change our worldviews continually</p>
<p>throughout that time.</p>
<p>So you can have these different phases of life.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to hear you speak a little Russian.</p>
<p>Do you speak Russian?</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>How did your Russian roots help you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>What can you say in Russian about that?</p>
<p>What can I say about my Russian roots?</p>
<p>When I just look at other projects,</p>
<p>other people in the blockchain industry,</p>
<p>sometimes when I look at what Russian people are doing,</p>
<p>what other people are doing,</p>
<p>I can sometimes feel that these people who are Russian</p>
<p>have something that feels similar to me,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s, so for people who don&rsquo;t speak Russian,</p>
<p>that Vitalik said that there is something to the spirit</p>
<p>of the people that are Russian</p>
<p>that are working in the cryptocurrency world</p>
<p>that is a little bit different</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that connects to some kind of aspect</p>
<p>of your own self, some kind of roots there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Do you think that there&rsquo;s, does it make you sad</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s these two different worlds</p>
<p>that are sort of in part disconnected by language?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure the same could be the case with China</p>
<p>and other parts of the world,</p>
<p>where the language slows the transmission of the beauty</p>
<p>of the culture in a certain kind of way</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t truly collaborate.</p>
<p>Like you can all speak English,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re collaborating on maybe a technical level,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not collaborating on the level</p>
<p>of some deep human connection.</p>
<p>Do you see that being able to speak both languages?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely benefits, I think,</p>
<p>to be able to speak multiple languages.</p>
<p>And once you can, you discover that even your mindset changes</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re speaking in one language versus the other.</p>
<p>People have told me this, like, when I speak Russian,</p>
<p>I sound more, I guess, to the point and pragmatic.</p>
<p>When I speak Chinese, I sound more cute.</p>
<p>When I speak English, I&rsquo;m something else.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s definitely a richness that you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re only in one of these language bubbles.</p>
<p>But I guess the arguments on the other side would be that</p>
<p>if everyone spoke the same language,</p>
<p>then there would just be one bubble.</p>
<p>This is the challenge, I think.</p>
<p>There are actually benefits to having cultural diversity,</p>
<p>and you definitely don&rsquo;t want the entire world</p>
<p>to be too conformist.</p>
<p>Well, one of the interesting things about crypto</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just a culture that actually manages</p>
<p>to somehow have its uniqueness and even preserve its independence</p>
<p>from all of these surrounding countries</p>
<p>despite being embedded in all of them.</p>
<p>So it spans outside of the geographic boundaries,</p>
<p>and language in some ways does as well.</p>
<p>And the way these cultures, these bubbles are created,</p>
<p>I mean, they overlap in interesting ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a hierarchy,</p>
<p>and the same is the case of the crypto world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s communities associated with these cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s communities within those communities, and it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s definitely sad</p>
<p>whenever these groups are fighting each other,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s definitely good for them if people can cooperate more.</p>
<p>But at the same time, just having groups of people</p>
<p>that have different kinds of life experiences,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely something to benefit from that.</p>
<p>So let me ask one last question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I asked you last time</p>
<p>the ridiculous question about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>You know, Dostoevsky said,</p>
<p>beauty will save the world.</p>
<p>Krasata spacet mir.</p>
<p>Some people believe money is a big part of happiness,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve turned&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;ve made a lot of money.</p>
<p>You turned away a lot of money.</p>
<p>You turned away a lot of power.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a fascinating person to ask,</p>
<p>what do you think is meaning to life?</p>
<p>The thing that I&rsquo;ve realized with money</p>
<p>as I have experienced both having little of it</p>
<p>and having a lot of it is that the benefit of&hellip;</p>
<p>You can get the most out of money if you think of it</p>
<p>not as something that lets you do and have more things,</p>
<p>but as something that lets you worry about fewer things, right?</p>
<p>Like, if your savings are just nonzero at all,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t have to worry as much about losing your job.</p>
<p>And if you feel like you have a job</p>
<p>that just really conflicts with your values,</p>
<p>then if you have even six months saved up,</p>
<p>that just makes it easier for you to say,</p>
<p>bye bye, I&rsquo;m going to do something else.</p>
<p>If you have more money, then you can not worry about</p>
<p>even what you&rsquo;re doing needing to be profitable at all.</p>
<p>Once you get more money, then you can choose transportation options</p>
<p>and food options that just have less hassle in your life</p>
<p>and allow you to be lazier.</p>
<p>So, this aspect of just reducing troubles</p>
<p>and opening up room for other things, I think, is a big part of it.</p>
<p>If you instead think of money as being this positive</p>
<p>or this thing that gives you stuff</p>
<p>and you try to derive meaning from the stuff,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s much more likely to be a road to basically squandering that opportunity.</p>
<p>So, yeah, and I guess my philosophy on that is definitely more subtractive than additive there.</p>
<p>But once you have enough money that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burdened with another question, which is of meaning.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s meaning to it all?</p>
<p>Or it seems like your own life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to build cool stuff that alleviates some level of suffering in the world.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, one way to think about it is like,</p>
<p>think back to how you thought about life when you were in school, right?</p>
<p>In school, this act is interesting to think about, right?</p>
<p>Because in a lot of ways, it&rsquo;s just totally outside of bounds of the kinds of systems,</p>
<p>like social systems that we live in as adults,</p>
<p>or maybe not, like maybe things like academia are intended to replicate parts of school.</p>
<p>Like, first of all, school is very totalitarian, right?</p>
<p>Like, you have to follow the teacher&rsquo;s instructions,</p>
<p>the bulk of your schedule is like forced to be in particular areas,</p>
<p>and you can control the real purview from leaving the grounds during this period of time,</p>
<p>assign a lot of homework.</p>
<p>But at the same time, also, school is a bit of a post scarcity utopia</p>
<p>in that you just don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting resources for yourself.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve both lived through 12 years of that, right?</p>
<p>So, what does that say about us?</p>
<p>And I think one thing of aspects, obviously, is that there&rsquo;s definitely an easiness to living life</p>
<p>if all of your decisions are made for you.</p>
<p>And one of the challenges of adulthood, I guess, is moving to this world</p>
<p>where all your choices are much more self directed,</p>
<p>and you just have to learn to live and deal with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, dealing with the burden of freedom, in some sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually interesting, because in some ways, I feel like even my first five years</p>
<p>of doing Ethereum things, my life was not even all that self directed,</p>
<p>because a lot of it was just responding to obligations.</p>
<p>Like someone said, oh, come to speak at this event in Korea.</p>
<p>Okay, come to speak at this thing in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>For Ethereum to launch, we need this particular piece to be done and tested.</p>
<p>Okay, work on that.</p>
<p>We need some proof of stake algorithm, work on that.</p>
<p>And the last year of COVID life, basically, I was holed up in Singapore for much of it.</p>
<p>And it gave me a lot more alone time.</p>
<p>I had much less travel.</p>
<p>And that was definitely a very new and interesting experience for me.</p>
<p>Would you characterize it by sadness, melancholy, hope, dreaming, innovative period?</p>
<p>How would you characterize that alone time?</p>
<p>Some of all five, definitely some self discovery.</p>
<p>I definitely did make this very deliberate decision that, okay, I have this time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to actually make something meaningful out of it.</p>
<p>So one example of the things I did is I just actually started</p>
<p>listening to your audio books and podcasts much more.</p>
<p>Just this year, I basically discovered that the podcast space is real for the first time,</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>Like before that, there would be things that I would get interviewed for,</p>
<p>but I was not mentally incorporate this idea that podcasts are a thing that you can go listen to.</p>
<p>And this year I did.</p>
<p>My friend, Carl Lafleur, one of the optimism people, recommended hardcore history to me.</p>
<p>And so I went ahead and just listened to all the hardcore histories.</p>
<p>And then after that, I listened to like 10 Luxfried mids and then a bunch of others.</p>
<p>And after that, I also got into audio books.</p>
<p>Oh, I listened to the entire The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the whole thing, 45 hours.</p>
<p>That was fascinating.</p>
<p>So let me ask about Dan, because Dan is going to love hearing this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to send it to him.</p>
<p>Do you have a period of history, whether it&rsquo;s Dan or in general,</p>
<p>that you draw for your own life, like kind of thinking about the world,</p>
<p>about human nature that you go to?</p>
<p>Is it World War II?</p>
<p>Is it Wrath of the Khans, the Genghis Khan?</p>
<p>Is it some other more ancient history?</p>
<p>Is it World War I?</p>
<p>Is there something that kind of echoes with you in the voice of Dan or anyone else that you connect to?</p>
<p>I feel like the 1930s and 40s are fascinating because they force you to really grapple with</p>
<p>the question of where does evil come from, right?</p>
<p>The sort of mental puzzle that I&rsquo;ve always had in my head is, on the one hand,</p>
<p>things like the Holocaust happened.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, if you just go and have a coffee with people,</p>
<p>then a hundred times out of a hundred, everyone just seems so nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>How do you kind of reconcile the macro and the micro there, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sort of thing that&rsquo;s very difficult if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of,</p>
<p>I guess, the right kind of personal experience,</p>
<p>especially if your personal experience starts off being sheltered, like it was for me, right?</p>
<p>I know the stereotype is that the nerds get bullied in school, but actually for me,</p>
<p>in my school experience was just being treated with kindness by everyone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that definitely made it harder to understand things.</p>
<p>I remember actually being pretty blindsided when I started Ethereum.</p>
<p>And then within six months, there started being fights over who would get more shares</p>
<p>if Ethereum turned out to be a company.</p>
<p>And then I suggested we should just make it to be a non profit,</p>
<p>and somehow that ended up upsetting people.</p>
<p>So the fascinating thing for me is that I&rsquo;ve been obviously reading and listening to the history,</p>
<p>and then at the same time, just observing things happening in the crypto world.</p>
<p>And so one of my interesting mental intuitions that I&rsquo;ve gotten is that I think most evil</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come out of greed, it comes out of fear.</p>
<p>And one example of this in Ethereum lands, right, is I think the part of Ethereum history</p>
<p>where I thought that the Ethereum community was at its lowest,</p>
<p>and even when I personally was at my lowest.</p>
<p>Now, if you go back to the Dow fork in 2016, right, so the Dow hack happened,</p>
<p>and then we made this controversial decision to change the Ethereum protocol.</p>
<p>And then there was that Ethereum Classic split.</p>
<p>And as soon as that Ethereum Classic split happened, there was a lot of anger everywhere.</p>
<p>And there started especially being anger when the price of ETC started taking up.</p>
<p>So this was the time when Ether started off being $13 and Ethereum Classic started at zero,</p>
<p>but then suddenly there was this one day when like ETH dropped to 12.5,</p>
<p>ETC went up to 0.5, and then they dropped more.</p>
<p>And people were saying things like,</p>
<p>oh, this whole Ethereum Classic is just a psyop by the Bitcoin community</p>
<p>and just the wealthy Bitcoiners trying to destroy Ethereum.</p>
<p>And in the back of my mind, I knew that that wasn&rsquo;t entirely true.</p>
<p>There definitely were Bitcoiners.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I think blaming disagreements on foreign interference,</p>
<p>like this is the sort of thing that countries, governments do all the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very convenient excuse because it allows you to just blame these things</p>
<p>that are happening on the foreigners and avoid actually grappling with the facts that like,</p>
<p>well, no, actually you have people in your very own community</p>
<p>who just disagree with you and have a different belief.</p>
<p>And I feel like the Ethereum community during that time</p>
<p>did not do a very good job of grappling with that.</p>
<p>And I feel like I during that time did not do a very good job of grappling with that.</p>
<p>And so there was a lot of blaming the Bitcoiners.</p>
<p>There were also even a lot of people calling for us to use trademark law</p>
<p>and basically sue exchanges and try to prevent them from listing Ethereum Classic.</p>
<p>And to me, that was very unethical, right?</p>
<p>Like basically using the government as a weapon to try to attack the other cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and destroy it goes completely against the ideals of freedom</p>
<p>and things that at least in theory were supposed to stand for.</p>
<p>But in that particular time, basically what was happening was that the ETC price was rising.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the ETH price was dropping in lockstep.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of Bitcoin people basically saying this is the end of Ethereum.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people really were afraid that</p>
<p>Ethereum would be just like completely destroyed as a result of this.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where the anger came from.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It came from the fear.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what allowed people to rationalize in abandonment of principles</p>
<p>that I think they would not have accepted in other circumstances.</p>
<p>And I definitely, to some extent, played along with this myself.</p>
<p>And I do definitely regret that to some extent.</p>
<p>Well, I definitely regret the excesses completely.</p>
<p>And then obviously, Bitcoin block size war, similar sort of stuff happened.</p>
<p>So that insight was interesting because it does mentally make a lot of sense</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually afraid that unless you act in some way</p>
<p>that your entire world is going to collapse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to just rationalize forgetting your principles</p>
<p>and doing whatever you have to just save the specific thing that you care about.</p>
<p>It feels like the right thing to do, the brave thing to do is in the face of fear</p>
<p>to still have compassion, to still have love as opposed to hate.</p>
<p>So the darkest moments, the toughest moments of human history</p>
<p>are those where fear is everywhere.</p>
<p>And despite that, the way to get out of that is through love, not giving into the fear.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s the lesson that you draw from all those moments of history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I like you have in terms of those coffee and the kindness that people have,</p>
<p>it does seem that everybody has the capacity for evil</p>
<p>and everybody has the capacity for love.</p>
<p>And you just have to create mechanisms and incentives</p>
<p>that prioritize the latter over the former.</p>
<p>Vitalik, you&rsquo;re one of the most interesting people I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to talk to.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>I hope we get a chance to talk again.</p>
<p>I hope I can at least be some small part.</p>
<p>This would be awesome in a podcast with you and Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>That would be an awesome conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for doing so much incredible technical innovation</p>
<p>that inspires the computer scientists, the economists,</p>
<p>inspires the world and what technology can do.</p>
<p>And now with longevity, I do hope we live a very long time</p>
<p>and play Diablo to make that long time fun.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you too, Alex.</p>
