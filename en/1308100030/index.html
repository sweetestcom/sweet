    <p>So are we supposed to start the podcast?</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Way to go.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t feel well today, huh?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I cannot kick this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with this sickness.</p>
<p>So, listener, if you notice that Pumps is hacking and sounds a little ill, she&rsquo;s under</p>
<p>the weather.</p>
<p>But we are going to push through because that&rsquo;s how dedicated we are on this podcast journey</p>
<p>and manifesting this podcast.</p>
<p>You do kind of have a little bit of a smoker&rsquo;s laugh.</p>
<p>All the time or just today?</p>
<p>Pretty much all the time.</p>
<p>I do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I earned that.</p>
<p>So Pumps, what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with sports parents.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>So my youngest, Luke, is in high school and it&rsquo;s the state basketball tournaments.</p>
<p>And his school has a really, really, really good team.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not even kidding you with the, you know, we want to take snacks every day.</p>
<p>We want to take food every day.</p>
<p>Parents are acting like this is the NBA finals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to the NBA finals.</p>
<p>Maybe the parents are as intricate to the playoff wins as the students.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen, because I&rsquo;m friends with a couple of your parent friends and I follow one dad</p>
<p>in particular on Instagram, and he posts a picture of the bracket and he puts the date</p>
<p>and then like a dramatic space in between it and the time and then another dramatic</p>
<p>space and then he puts the big house.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking, listener, about for a high school basketball team in which the man that</p>
<p>posted this is not a player.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a high school basketball team.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But he is by no means alone.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>The fervor that is around this, it truly, it&rsquo;s comparable to the Olympics.</p>
<p>And I did have a big hissy fit because everybody was like, we&rsquo;re going to sign up to take snacks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to sign up to do this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to sign up to do that.</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If these kids can go buy their own snacks, like this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I have to say the moms made each kid a poster, like a playing card poster.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And Luke super duper loves it.</p>
<p>So I have had to eat a little crow on that.</p>
<p>Where do the posters go?</p>
<p>And they decorate the locker rooms, Jennifer.</p>
<p>And the moms are making these?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re decorating the laundry or the locker room.</p>
<p>See when we were in high school, I was a cheerleader as you were as well.</p>
<p>We did this.</p>
<p>Like we made, and the moms are up at the school making posters and decorating the locker room.</p>
<p>And have been for three weeks leading up to this.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;ve already gone to school.</p>
<p>They need to get the fuck out of the locker room.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>These moms that are up there at the school, tomahawk choppers, fucking blackhawk needs</p>
<p>to go down.</p>
<p>These women have got to pump the brakes and let the kids go to school and let the kids</p>
<p>do all of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>These are the same people that are probably bitch about, well, you know, that Gen Z, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so lazy.</p>
<p>And I wonder the fuck why?</p>
<p>Because mom&rsquo;s up making posters via glamour shots and trotting it all out over the locker</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rampant.</p>
<p>What have you had it with my darling?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, you know, Kylie has blown us up on TikTok, right?</p>
<p>So TikTok is this whole new, you know, like something I would compare to probably crack</p>
<p>cocaine.</p>
<p>You know, you get on there and it&rsquo;s just like, you know, you&rsquo;re just getting flooded with</p>
<p>all this shit.</p>
<p>So I get on there, of course, to go to our page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it to see how that&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And I notice that there&rsquo;s like post after post on TikTok and it&rsquo;s called the moon phases</p>
<p>and soulmates trend.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>TikTok users believe that moon phases trend reveals your soulmate.</p>
<p>So what you do is you take, you figure out like you were born in what, February 18th?</p>
<p>17th, 70.</p>
<p>70.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Not 60?</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>So then you figure out what the moon was the day you were born, would figure out what the</p>
<p>moon was the day that some love interest of yours was born.</p>
<p>And if like yours is a half moon and theirs is a half moon and it fits together, then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your soulmate.</p>
<p>Oh, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>That is ridiculous.</p>
<p>It is a jet stream of bullshit.</p>
<p>It is right up there with the astrological signs.</p>
<p>Probably even worse.</p>
<p>I was going to say probably even worse because you have to do so much research.</p>
<p>So anyway, you compare your date with your partner&rsquo;s and a lot of people are now comparing</p>
<p>them to their pets, which I can kind of get a little bit more on board with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right up your alley.</p>
<p>Although I do think all of that stuff is total bullshit, but it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen it on TikTok, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just seen like the moon things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber and their moons fit perfectly together.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re already married, so it&rsquo;s a little late.</p>
<p>Their soulmates.</p>
<p>So I asked Kylie to do some matching of moons.</p>
<p>So Kylie matched our moons.</p>
<p>But wait, listener, I want you to hear something.</p>
<p>Pumps, remember when you called me like a year ago and you said that Emily asked you</p>
<p>who your soulmate was?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Listener, how you answered that?</p>
<p>I said, Jennifer, immediately.</p>
<p>Never skipped a beat.</p>
<p>That is so sweet.</p>
<p>She called me and she said, Emily just asked me who my soulmate was.</p>
<p>And I said, Jennifer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see what the moon says.</p>
<p>That that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s false?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>You two are not soulmates.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, we&rsquo;re not?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I did Jennifer&rsquo;s, Pumps, Josh&rsquo;s, and Tubby&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s who was soulmates in that group.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jennifer, you had one soulmate.</p>
<p>Tubby.</p>
<p>And Josh.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get too excited.</p>
<p>Josh had three soulmates.</p>
<p>Who were they?</p>
<p>Josh and Pumps, Josh and Jennifer, and Josh and Tubby.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>The fact that he would have three soulmates tells me that whole thing is fucked up.</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>So Josh and I were moon soulmates?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>We better fucking should be moon soulmates.</p>
<p>I mean, that guy has been to rehab.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been together 22 years, listener.</p>
<p>Not all dandy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It has not been a cakewalk.</p>
<p>And he has been to rehab five times.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to really love somebody to go to family week, not once, but multiple</p>
<p>times because you sit in a circle, you get in touch with your inner child, you write</p>
<p>letters to yourself in your non-dominant hand.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just a lot of shit that goes down when you&rsquo;re kind of looking around the</p>
<p>circle going, okay, I&rsquo;m over this.</p>
<p>Like when can I go home?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the one with the drug problem.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of somewhat thrilled to know that the moon aligns.</p>
<p>But even if it didn&rsquo;t, I still think it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Tubby&rsquo;s soulmate?</p>
<p>Josh?</p>
<p>Josh.</p>
<p>Is that it?</p>
<p>Not Jennifer at all?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a heartbreak.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s because you guys pretty much share the same birthday.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>And I just want to let the listener know, fun fact, Tubby and Barack Obama have the</p>
<p>same birthday.</p>
<p>So that means you and Barack are also not soulmates.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a heartbreak.</p>
<p>Pumps, how do you feel about Josh being your soulmate?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty close friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think-</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re close.</p>
<p>Yeah, y&rsquo;all are close.</p>
<p>You used to have to drive him to court and you&rsquo;d pump his gas.</p>
<p>He is such a fucking diva-</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>&hellip; that I would have to pump the gas and drive.</p>
<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t want to mess his suit up.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And I was wearing a suit too, but he&rsquo;s just a titty, baby, bougie POS sometimes.</p>
<p>So listener, back in the day, Josh and Pumps practiced law together.</p>
<p>And they would go, have to drive to these small towns in rural Oklahoma together.</p>
<p>Josh would make Pumps drive.</p>
<p>And she did it willingly.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, okay, whatever, you prima donna.</p>
<p>And then she would pump the gas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I always pump the gas.</p>
<p>The only thing, I was fine with all that just because I like to browbeat him about him making</p>
<p>me do it.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem Josh and I had during that period of time was the cupholders.</p>
<p>We were-</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>We all had so many drinks.</p>
<p>I mean, the cupholder situation was always an issue of contention between the two of</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>I just cringe right now thinking about getting into a vehicle with you if I just have one</p>
<p>little normal sized portable water.</p>
<p>Because I know that you are going to come in with a Stanley cup, the backup cup, and</p>
<p>then a bottle of water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>Flying in an airport with you is awful with all the beverages.</p>
<p>And then people that drink all these beverages all the time have to go pee all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this vicious cycle where you&rsquo;re not taking into account the people around</p>
<p>you with your slurping, constant bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Josh is every bit as bad as me about all the cups too.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, before I welcome you to our podcast, we&rsquo;ve had it with sports parents,</p>
<p>grown women that are hanging out at their children&rsquo;s high school because you&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>been to school.</p>
<p>So get the fuck out of there.</p>
<p>The whole moon soulmate thing is bullshit with the exception of Josh Welch and me.</p>
<p>I will forever not be able to handle all these goddamn beverages that you drink.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just unbelievable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never get over it.</p>
<p>This is a, you know, we could drag out this dead horse and beat it.</p>
<p>And I have just as much resentment talking about it now as I did 10 years ago.</p>
<p>It still feels fresh and unresolved.</p>
<p>I just have to say, I enjoy it so much when you get all revved up.</p>
<p>I know you do.</p>
<p>I know you do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re such good friends.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast, a place where you can come every Tuesday and Thursday and</p>
<p>get everything off your chest so that you can go back out into the world, a kinder and</p>
<p>gentler soul to find your moon soulmate.</p>
<p>Maybe you should be a sister wife.</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk to him about his hair products and stuff at times.</p>
<p>We already kind of do.</p>
<p>I was going to say, he called me this weekend about a very personal medical issue that I</p>
<p>kept thinking, is he really calling to tell me that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s calling about?</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>So I mean, you kind of are a sister wife.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably too late for that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already there.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to have a fantastic guest listener.</p>
<p>Her name is Jackie Schimmel.</p>
<p>She is the producer, writer, and podcast host of The Bitch Bible.</p>
<p>Fantastic name.</p>
<p>Fantastic name.</p>
<p>Loving it.</p>
<p>She is a self-proclaimed good time gal and professional asshole.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I love her already.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get Jackie on here.</p>
<p>Hi Jackie.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>This is a safe place for you to air petty, immature, just juicy little grievances that</p>
<p>you have with anybody in your life or any situation in your life.</p>
<p>I love that so much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re speaking my language.</p>
<p>Can you tell us what you&rsquo;ve had it with just right off the cuff?</p>
<p>I mean, I could name 700 things for 14 hours.</p>
<p>Like I just woke up and I barely had a sip of water and I am ready to fully launch in</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with floating shelves, fiddle-leaf figs, Apple watches, pregnant people, International</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Day, men who drive Hyundai&rsquo;s and then they take the emblem off their car and put</p>
<p>spoilers on it and rims and pretend they&rsquo;re driving a Maserati, sunglasses, Lake Havasu.</p>
<p>I mean, I could go on and on and on.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s circle back to one in particular, which is the pregnant people, which I believe</p>
<p>you are now an offender.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a buzzkill and such a letdown.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t even believe it, to be honest.</p>
<p>I, um, yes, I&rsquo;m almost six months pregnant, which is just weird to even say out loud.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s been difficult terrain for me because I am so consistently irritated</p>
<p>with, uh, pregnant women and like the mama bear tribe, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not every pregnant woman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a subgroup of pregnant women who act like they are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jewish.</p>
<p>So I, forgive me if I&rsquo;m messing up this reference, but like Mary Magdalene or something, like</p>
<p>the Messiah or something, it is so overwhelming and overbearing and annoying and counterproductive</p>
<p>to feminism.</p>
<p>These women walk around like they&rsquo;re the first and only person to ever do it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re so foaming at the mouth to give you both tips and tricks, um, to tell you</p>
<p>that your life hasn&rsquo;t started until you&rsquo;ve had a child, which is wildly offensive to</p>
<p>women who choose not to have children, which by the way, as the days go on sounding more</p>
<p>and more fucking appealing to me, no shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right on that.</p>
<p>I mean, come on.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ll never know love until you, and I&rsquo;m like, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to cuss by the way?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been two and a half minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mandatory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mandatory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely fucking mandatory, Jackie.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you about this universal uniqueness that pregnant women feel that,</p>
<p>that subsect that you&rsquo;re talking about, wait until the baby comes out.</p>
<p>And then you have the labor and delivery warriors that tell you from start to finish their labor</p>
<p>and delivery story as though they&rsquo;re the only people that have ever squeezed a child out</p>
<p>of their vagina and or had a C-section because you will hear a lot of details about it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the breastfeeding posse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the worst one.</p>
<p>Act like that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m worried about.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s going to get a million times worse for you.</p>
<p>This is, this is just the tip of the fucking iceberg.</p>
<p>Fasten your seatbelt because that it&rsquo;s, all of it is about to march out and it is going</p>
<p>to completely haunt your life.</p>
<p>And these women are like heat seeking missiles.</p>
<p>They sense it.</p>
<p>They will sense that you&rsquo;re not one of them.</p>
<p>Try to convert you.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be marching outside my fucking house.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>But let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Have you become, um, like I am, I&rsquo;m not a crier.</p>
<p>I cry once annually at a very big deal.</p>
<p>But when I was pregnant, I cried all the time.</p>
<p>Commercials.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It was pathetic.</p>
<p>Oh, it was awful.</p>
<p>I hated feeling so much.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just, have you experienced this?</p>
<p>I will tell you, I&rsquo;ve been waiting for that.</p>
<p>And I too am someone who is a bit of an ice queen.</p>
<p>I never cry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, I cry from laughter and joy often and Nancy Meyers movies, but I never find myself</p>
<p>moved enough emotionally in the other direction to really cry.</p>
<p>And I try sometimes I&rsquo;m really like, I like, first of all, I&rsquo;m a gorgeous crier.</p>
<p>I have a lot of sodium retention.</p>
<p>I find that after I cry, I look svelte, I look chiseled and I look glowing.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Push it sometimes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;m not feeling any of those feels and I feel like I know nada.</p>
<p>So you really are a sociopath.</p>
<p>1000%.</p>
<p>I will say that I&rsquo;ve gotten nicer, which is scary.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why or when or how, or maybe I&rsquo;m just too tired to really like launch into</p>
<p>my usual sport of verbal assault.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But, um, I&rsquo;ve gotten a little bit nicer, which is disgusting.</p>
<p>So towards the last, so my second child, his due date was end of July and we live in</p>
<p>Oklahoma city and he was born in 2006.</p>
<p>And so from like July 1st and he was finally born on July 25th.</p>
<p>It was record heat over 100 degrees all 25 days in a row.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nine months pregnant.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And at this point, like I, I do not like being pregnant.</p>
<p>I did not like having my belly out to here.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel cute.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I hated everything about it.</p>
<p>So at this point I hate all my maternity clothes.</p>
<p>I hate everything I own.</p>
<p>I hate everybody.</p>
<p>And so I go to old Navy and this is the mid 2000s and so those gaucho pants were kind</p>
<p>of in, I buy five pair of black gaucho pants and I am on a maternity strike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not buying maternity clothes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, and I&rsquo;m nine months pregnant.</p>
<p>I mean just share principles.</p>
<p>So I buy five pair of these black gaucho pants and five black wife beater tank tops and I</p>
<p>wear them every day.</p>
<p>So about a week before the baby&rsquo;s born, I have a three year old at the time.</p>
<p>We go to target, I buy all this shit and I&rsquo;m nesting at the house.</p>
<p>Well, my husband, he was a total prima donna.</p>
<p>I mean like product junkie asshole out the wazoo, right?</p>
<p>He comes pulling up in his Range Rover.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unloading the groceries and the toddler and the black gauchos and the black wife beater</p>
<p>tank top.</p>
<p>He pulls up and he goes, oh, I see you got your uniform on today.</p>
<p>And he is in an Armani suit.</p>
<p>His hair looks great.</p>
<p>He smells great.</p>
<p>And I reach into the back of my car and I grab a carton of Horizon milk and I take it</p>
<p>and I scream, fuck you.</p>
<p>And I throw it at him and it hits the concrete.</p>
<p>And this milk just goes everywhere.</p>
<p>My toddler&rsquo;s like, mommy.</p>
<p>And Josh is like, oh wow.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you can fuck right on off criticizing my little outfit that I got at old Navy.</p>
<p>I feel that like deep in my ovaries for sure.</p>
<p>I almost murdered my husband when I was like seven, eight weeks pregnant and all I wanted</p>
<p>was French toast.</p>
<p>It was like all I could think about for hours.</p>
<p>I dreamt of it.</p>
<p>I had one little piece of bread left and like one sprinkle of cinnamon.</p>
<p>I gave him really specific instructions and that fucker decided to hit it with a little</p>
<p>Maldon salt on top and serve it to me.</p>
<p>So I take a bite and there&rsquo;s like a flaky, flaky sea salt right on the top.</p>
<p>And I looked at him and I was like, did you put salt on the French toast?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, you know, sometimes you have like chocolate chip cookies with</p>
<p>a little salt.</p>
<p>And I said, this is not the time to get fucking creative, Thomas Keller.</p>
<p>I will rip your dick off.</p>
<p>And I took the plate and I threw it in the sink.</p>
<p>I started, I actually did cry.</p>
<p>That was the only time I&rsquo;ve cried like tears of agony over that French toast.</p>
<p>And I was like, we&rsquo;re not going to make it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never know your son.</p>
<p>That is unauthorized use of salt.</p>
<p>I mean, that was completely unauthorized.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t fuck with pregnant women like this.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t comment on their appearance.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fuck up their French toast.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t show up looking great when your wife&rsquo;s nine months pregnant and comment on</p>
<p>her outfit.</p>
<p>Josh Welch, fucker.</p>
<p>I mean, the milk just went straight at him.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something that nobody&rsquo;s going to tell you, but we&rsquo;re going to tell you.</p>
<p>Get ready for this.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to go in to deliver this baby and you&rsquo;re going to get an epidural.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go home and they&rsquo;re going to give you some painkillers, which you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to take as prescribed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be more constipated than you have ever been in your entire life.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking nine, 10, 11 days not taking a shit.</p>
<p>Nobody fucking talks about this.</p>
<p>This is not in the pregnancy advertisement.</p>
<p>That first post-pregnancy shit for me personally was more difficult than giving birth.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Pabst, tell her what you did with your ass.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Tell her.</p>
<p>Please tell me.</p>
<p>Well, I would recommend start taking the stool softener like two weeks before.</p>
<p>Tell her.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I was so miserable and I couldn&rsquo;t poop and I thought I was going to lose my mind.</p>
<p>And so I got a spoon and was trying to dig it out with this spoon.</p>
<p>She stuck a spoon up her ass.</p>
<p>I mean, I was like in-</p>
<p>Were you like soft serve?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to like scoop it out of you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was going.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just, I was so irate and beside myself that I was like, go get me a spoon.</p>
<p>And then of course I-</p>
<p>Are we talking like a stainless steel, are we talking like a silicone spatula?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re talking like a stainless steel teaspoon.</p>
<p>So a skinnier teaspoon.</p>
<p>A skinnier teaspoon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Did you lube it?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did you lube it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I lubed it.</p>
<p>I was so miserable.</p>
<p>You barebacked that spoon up your ass?</p>
<p>You barebacked that fucking teaspoon right up your ass?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>That dirty slut.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I love you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p>If I get to that place-</p>
<p>Not if.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to shove-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no if.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I promise you, this thing is coming for you.</p>
<p>If you epidural, you do those painkillers, you are going to think of us, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be on that toilet, you&rsquo;re going to be red, veins bulging out of your neck, squeezing</p>
<p>as hard as you can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be like, I don&rsquo;t think I pushed this hard when I delivered the kid.</p>
<p>And then it will start to crown a little bit, and then you hear the baby cry, and you exhale,</p>
<p>and then it goes right back up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, this is not talked about.</p>
<p>This is not in the advertisements.</p>
<p>This is a huge problem that is going widely ignored globally.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you.</p>
<p>I think we found our philanthropic work for the future.</p>
<p>We need to start like a fundraiser, a merch, a donation center.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>We could be the faces of post-birth constipation solutions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that.</p>
<p>We could have maybe a teaspoon condoms that are lubricated for merch so people like pumps</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to bear back anymore.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Lube automatically with the condoms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That is a great idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love what we&rsquo;re doing here today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important work.</p>
<p>It is big time work, but I&rsquo;m telling you, that is coming for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad.</p>
<p>I cannot wait.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so miserable.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Mother Nature does to pregnant women, the labor and delivery in the first</p>
<p>three months of having a baby.</p>
<p>You kind of have amnesia about how miserable all of it is, and I think it&rsquo;s like a Darwinian</p>
<p>way to make sure we reproduce again.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in it-</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in debt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking when you have a teaspoon crammed up your ass with no lubricant and no condom</p>
<p>trying to dig out a shit, you go ahead and have another baby because you forget that</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>I remember-</p>
<p>Which is psychotic in theory.</p>
<p>Psychotic.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I remember with my first son when he was born, I remember like the first three to four months</p>
<p>thinking, why would anybody ever do this twice?</p>
<p>Like I was completely convinced I would never have another baby, ended up having two more.</p>
<p>So I have a little advice for you.</p>
<p>When you get to the early part of the summer months, if you happen to go to a swimming</p>
<p>pool, eight to nine months pregnant, Pumps and I, when she was pregnant with her third,</p>
<p>we went to a swimming pool.</p>
<p>I had a toddler at the time, did not have my second, and we put our kids in the little</p>
<p>kiddie pool, and I&rsquo;m sitting on the ledge of the kiddie pool with my feet in, and Pumps</p>
<p>is wearing eight.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s nine months pregnant.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s wearing a black one-piece swimsuit, and she&rsquo;s standing up next to me.</p>
<p>So if I turn my head to the left, I have a direct view of her belly, and then I kind</p>
<p>of look down, and the swimsuit is going down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to cup over the crotch and the vagine.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, my eyes, as I turn left, I&rsquo;m about parallel, right smack dab on with a profile shot of</p>
<p>the vagine, and the belly was so far out.</p>
<p>The swimsuit was a couple of inches out, so I could see sunlight through pubic hairs</p>
<p>straight across the pool.</p>
<p>Like the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So just a little tip from I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast to pregnant women.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do what Pumps did.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a swimsuit that sucks up to the vagine so that your friend doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see all of that.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Did you do any sort of vaginal grooming prior to your delivery?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I did.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the doctor?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How do you feel about this, Jackie?</p>
<p>What are you going to do with your vagine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I had laser hair removal the day before I found out I was pregnant.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Impeccable timing, so my baby will probably be bald, and I also had Botox the day before</p>
<p>I found out I was pregnant, like from the neck, from the top of the tits to the forehead.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s got to be great for my fetus.</p>
<p>So since I&rsquo;ve been pregnant, everything has come back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>With an Ashkenazi vengeance, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>It is coming back full force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, bitch, 18 rounds of laser hair removal hasn&rsquo;t done shit, and it is erupting</p>
<p>out of my skin.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It is dark, and it is thick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I, for my own sanity, I&rsquo;m going to get my first wax next week, because I need to,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a rough situation.</p>
<p>And because of the laser, it&rsquo;s patchy, so there is no consistency in my foliage, if</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like an attractive 1970s porn bush.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bald and aging, like a mangy dog.</p>
<p>A mangy porn bush.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go with Alicia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like half of it is fine, and then half of it is back with the vengeance, and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get a grip on the situation.</p>
<p>So I think I need to kick it back to basics.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t shave.</p>
<p>My skin is too sensitive.</p>
<p>Were you Brazilian?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I want to go full Brazilian.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m going to be a mother, I feel like it might be in poor taste.</p>
<p>I think I need to keep a little, like, the problem is I don&rsquo;t even have enough in that</p>
<p>area to have like a nice, clean strip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still going to be patchy.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s interesting, the evolution of pubic hair.</p>
<p>Do you remember that July 4th, we were at the club, drank a bunch of club specials.</p>
<p>Our friend Sarah was telling us about how she trimmed her vagine with her razor, not</p>
<p>scissors.</p>
<p>So I go home, too many cocktails.</p>
<p>I get in the shower, and I decide to do that, and I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;ll just do this.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it was mangy dog.</p>
<p>I had to take the whole thing off.</p>
<p>It was that bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I went to bed, and I forgot when I woke up that I had done it.</p>
<p>And I sat down on that toilet the next morning, and I thought, I was just like, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, what happened?</p>
<p>It was so startling.</p>
<p>I bet.</p>
<p>It was awful.</p>
<p>She called me the next morning, and she&rsquo;s like, do you remember how drunk we were yesterday?</p>
<p>And Sarah was telling us how she like, you know, trimmed her vagine.</p>
<p>So I did that to mine, and then I fucked it up.</p>
<p>And so I shaved it all off, and then I totally forgot about it.</p>
<p>This morning, I thought, what happened to my pubic hair?</p>
<p>It was bad.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, I decided that I was going to try to give myself an at-home Amazon</p>
<p>vagina wax.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s ambitious.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>So ambitious.</p>
<p>I mean, this is how you knew, like, I was really bored.</p>
<p>I was trying to just like, DIY all my like, you know, beauty routines.</p>
<p>And my husband was out of town for a couple days, so I was like, this is the perfect time</p>
<p>for me to like, you know, put the mirror down, spread Eagle on the floor, and like, try to</p>
<p>figure this out.</p>
<p>I got through a couple strips, and it was stripless wax.</p>
<p>It was the wax that dries on your skin, which is supposed to be less painful, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not ripping at your skin.</p>
<p>It only allegedly adheres to the hair.</p>
<p>Incorrect.</p>
<p>One-star review.</p>
<p>I put it all over.</p>
<p>I got through one, like, I&rsquo;m bleeding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, barely getting it off.</p>
<p>And then I had one real close to the labia, and I just couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Like, I tried.</p>
<p>I tried.</p>
<p>And before it was fully dried, I wanted to try to like, scrub it off, because I just</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t go through with it.</p>
<p>I stood up.</p>
<p>I walked to the bathroom, and my labia glued shut.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because I, when I was, you know, I don&rsquo;t even need to do a demo, but my legs were spread.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I was putting the wax on the inside.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I wanted to abort mission, so I stand up to go to the sink, and in the pursuit of</p>
<p>standing up to rid myself of this stripless purple wax, my vagina glued shut.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>My.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>I have to ask.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you fix it?</p>
<p>I mean, how&rsquo;d you get it not to be glued shut?</p>
<p>So I, they had some like, like an oil solution that was supposed to like, get rid of the</p>
<p>remnants of leftover wax.</p>
<p>And I was just slathering it all over myself.</p>
<p>It did not really work.</p>
<p>This is towards, you know, I had a couple of martinis at the time, and then I was like,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>Fuck this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll figure it out in the morning.</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, like a midnight pee.</p>
<p>And when I went to go sit down to pee, it occurred to me that my vagina was still glued</p>
<p>shut.</p>
<p>And it kind of started, started like, coming out the back almost.</p>
<p>Like it didn&rsquo;t, the pee was not exiting.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t exiting properly.</p>
<p>This is, I mean, this is a stage five vaginal meltdown is what this is.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a smart person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can figure this out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of crafty and handy, not, not for an at-home wax.</p>
<p>It was traumatizing.</p>
<p>It took days.</p>
<p>This is something that that&rsquo;s 1000% something that pumps would do.</p>
<p>I mean, 100%.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>She could fuck up a wet dream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Her ability to fuck shit up is unparalleled.</p>
<p>I mean, it is.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s right there with you.</p>
<p>You are in good company.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to Apple watches.</p>
<p>I want to hear, cause I&rsquo;m an Apple watch wearer and pumps is too.</p>
<p>So you tell us, I mean, and don&rsquo;t, you know, we have thick skin, so just make your case.</p>
<p>I will make my case.</p>
<p>I have been under a lot of scrutiny recently because I said in my podcast that I think</p>
<p>it is atrocious, unacceptable, and just blasphemous that people think that it&rsquo;s okay to wear Apple</p>
<p>watches to weddings and or various formal events.</p>
<p>I think you can take the night off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about it because I&rsquo;ve been verbally assaulted by strangers on the internet</p>
<p>talking about their insulin levels and their rings and their kiddos and their babysitters</p>
<p>and, you know, every, their heart monitors and everything under the sun, making me like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a terrible person because I don&rsquo;t care about them going into cardiac arrest while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re writing your Apple watch.</p>
<p>While I understand all of those things may be true, I still aesthetically have an issue.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to a wedding.</p>
<p>Maybe you take the Apple watch off.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to wear to an event.</p>
<p>Call me crazy.</p>
<p>I agree with you intellectually and everything that you just said.</p>
<p>And I say, fuck the, fuck the opposing view on the internet.</p>
<p>Cause like, I mean, there&rsquo;s always some sub cult that, I mean, they&rsquo;re going to come out</p>
<p>after this episode, the breastfeeders, the pubic cares, the people with mangy pubic hair,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re coming for us.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They are coming.</p>
<p>They can fuck off.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>They can fuck right on off.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care at all.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Get a journal.</p>
<p>We welcome them because we like to do dramatic readings of them for comedic relief, but same.</p>
<p>I agree with everything you say intellectually, but I am an offender.</p>
<p>And let me tell you why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for lifesaving measures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about my kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about my pets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to let my watch down without saying fucking bosses me around all day.</p>
<p>I get these badges, I get these awards.</p>
<p>I have this fucked up codependent relationship with the watch where it&rsquo;s like, you need to</p>
<p>stand up.</p>
<p>You need to breathe.</p>
<p>You need to do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, God, this fucking thing is so goddamn bossy, but I&rsquo;ve got to close my rings.</p>
<p>And I went to an engagement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that means.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The ring.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So I love that.</p>
<p>I live with the careless abandoned, not knowing what it&rsquo;s like to close a fucking ring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know.</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss, because let me tell you how bad, what an offender I am at this.</p>
<p>I went to an engagement party the other night.</p>
<p>Great dress.</p>
<p>I got a great blowout.</p>
<p>Josh looked great, per ush.</p>
<p>We strolled into this event, great shoes, great handbag, Apple watch.</p>
<p>And I even looked down.</p>
<p>You just took a big step back.</p>
<p>No, it was a big L. And I knew it.</p>
<p>I looked down.</p>
<p>I was looking at like ladies bracelets and wedding rings and whatnot.</p>
<p>And I was like, I have on my Apple watch here and it does not look good.</p>
<p>It does not look good with this outfit, but I&rsquo;m not taking it off because I can&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>this watch down.</p>
<p>This watch is on me.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It is on me like a fucking tick on a dog.</p>
<p>I mean, it is like all over me to do the right thing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to let the watch down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I agree intellectually with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with the rings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with all of it.</p>
<p>But some things we have it with, but we are contributors to the problem, right?</p>
<p>Most of the things that we bitch about, quite frankly, we probably do because it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>whole thing.</p>
<p>You spot it.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, totally.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m like one week away from an Apple watch.</p>
<p>So pretend you never saw anything.</p>
<p>And the best is when people on the internet, which I&rsquo;m sure you guys get a ton of when</p>
<p>you like voice a really passionate opinion and then people are like, why do you care?</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to get a life.</p>
<p>Do you understand that it is my livelihood and it is my calling in life to bitch and</p>
<p>complain overtly, passionately about things I barely care about fun and I could flip and</p>
<p>switch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And whip and nay nay and totally changed my mind 30 seconds later, but I have a job to</p>
<p>do for the people.</p>
<p>Brenda.</p>
<p>I will scream into a microphone and do I actually care that much?</p>
<p>Not really, but we got to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>I have a child to raise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Fuck sake.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it great.</p>
<p>I, I, we find it incredibly flattering that people take the time to go onto the internet</p>
<p>to tell you how much they either dislike you, dislike your opinion, because that takes energy.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have that kind of energy to comment on two middle-aged women&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, I just don&rsquo;t fucking have that in me.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something I really like, I&rsquo;d be like, Oh my God, this is hilarious.</p>
<p>But if I dislike something, I simply just cease watching it, cease listening to it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the end of it.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, they&rsquo;re obsessed with me.</p>
<p>They love me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, I&rsquo;ve never written like a negative comment on a stranger&rsquo;s anything in my whole</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>And I got a lot of free time on my hands.</p>
<p>So the fact that people have the, have the care and the passion and the investment and</p>
<p>the time, the time, it&rsquo;s a beautiful transaction and they don&rsquo;t get it because it&rsquo;s like, this</p>
<p>is like a love letter.</p>
<p>Like this is Nicholas Sparks shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Noah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ali.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re writing me all these letters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not writing you back, you know, like it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>We view it through the same lens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful and we welcome it.</p>
<p>And it just really brings us so much heart warming joy.</p>
<p>It feels good.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>It does feel good.</p>
<p>Well, Jackie, we cannot thank you enough for sharing with us what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>And I want to circle back with you and when&rsquo;s your due date?</p>
<p>July 15th.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>About 10 days.</p>
<p>So July, July 25th, that will be my son&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>Around that time, you should be having your first post delivery shit and I want to get</p>
<p>knee deep into that shit with you, unintended.</p>
<p>We would like to circle back with you and have you back on this podcast so that we can</p>
<p>shine a light to this very underreported problem that is troubling women all across the globe.</p>
<p>I would be happy to donate my experience to science, humanitarian work for the sake of</p>
<p>women everywhere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re filming this on International Women&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>So that is my contribution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>This was so fun.</p>
<p>It was so fun, Jackie.</p>
<p>We hope to see you soon and good luck with the delivery and the breastfeeding nurses.</p>
<p>It is a fucking minefield out there.</p>
<p>Just put a sign out there that says, mind your business.</p>
<p>Draw boundaries.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this, Jackie.</p>
<p>Boundaries, baby.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Bye, Jackie.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>She is the most fun.</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>I mean, she is so good.</p>
<p>She is fantastic.</p>
<p>I mean, she is like totally on brand with us.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s had it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s cynical.</p>
<p>Sharp as a tack, that one.</p>
<p>I really feel badly for her about, because now we&rsquo;ve planted the seed about the constipation,</p>
<p>which I think can exacerbate constipation.</p>
<p>Well, I hope she just starts taking those stool softeners like two weeks before.</p>
<p>I did with Roman because you advised me to do so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t get it out.</p>
<p>But just in the same way that you advised me that Roman was going to be a girl, it was</p>
<p>an abject failure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was a total failure beyond measure.</p>
<p>You would think if we could put a man on the moon, we should be able to get women that</p>
<p>just deliver a baby to have a poop.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sadly, you know, I think if we could put the science, you know, the science they put into</p>
<p>erections is, I mean, it&rsquo;s outstanding.</p>
<p>Ridiculously.</p>
<p>Four hours they can make that thing last.</p>
<p>Which is just a nightmare on every level.</p>
<p>Women able to take a shit after squeezing a baby out of their vagine seems to have taken</p>
<p>the back burner.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think that this is a huge issue that we need to discuss.</p>
<p>And I want, listener, listen up.</p>
<p>I know a lot of you are ladies and I know a lot of you have had children and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>probably experienced what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Please DM us, not gory details, but we want some, we want to know, I mean, we&rsquo;re not alone</p>
<p>in this.</p>
<p>Did that ever happen in a vacuum with pumps in me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Everybody I know.</p>
<p>Did anybody else stick, you think anybody else barebacked a spoon up their ass?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was so desperate.</p>
<p>I was so desperate.</p>
<p>How far did you stick it up there?</p>
<p>Not very far.</p>
<p>Cause I couldn&rsquo;t get it in.</p>
<p>An inch?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think I got it really in.</p>
<p>When you say in, you kind of like are circling your hand around.</p>
<p>Well, I was trying to.</p>
<p>Were you quick screwing it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was trying to get it in there and I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the idea was to get it in.</p>
<p>Break it up.</p>
<p>No gory details.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the worst offenders.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We are the worst.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>Listener.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Listener.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be canceled.</p>
<p>Or people are going to say, me too.</p>
<p>So listener, we want to thank you for joining us.</p>
<p>Please follow us on all the social medias.</p>
<p>Give us all the stars, write all the reviews, just do all of those things.</p>
<p>And then we will see you next Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>Spells count either way.</p>
<p>It sure does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
