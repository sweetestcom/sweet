    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>This month, we&rsquo;re talking all about the science of emotions</p>
<p>and tools related to the science of emotions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the science of stress and resiliency,</p>
<p>tools to access more calm,</p>
<p>tools to raise your stress threshold</p>
<p>to become more resilient.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about motivation</p>
<p>and the role of the dopamine system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make a couple of announcements</p>
<p>about some new resources.</p>
<p>The first one is that we have now captioned</p>
<p>all the Huberman Lab episodes in English and in Spanish.</p>
<p>We were able to do that</p>
<p>thanks to your support of our sponsors and on Patreon.</p>
<p>So now all of the podcasts</p>
<p>have a captioning feature on YouTube,</p>
<p>and those were done by experts.</p>
<p>So while there might be the occasional error,</p>
<p>for the most part, they&rsquo;re very precise.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that so that people</p>
<p>that prefer to consume the content in Spanish</p>
<p>or that like to read the content</p>
<p>from the English subtitles can do so.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to continue to expand</p>
<p>the number of languages that are captioned</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So we want to thank you for that resource.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now available for all episodes.</p>
<p>In addition, in previous episodes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about NSDR or non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>NSDRs come in a variety of different forms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pointed you to some resources for that previously.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s yoga nidra.</p>
<p>NSDR is really about achieving calm quickly</p>
<p>and doing that in a self-directed way for many reasons,</p>
<p>in order to access sleep more readily,</p>
<p>in order to de-stress very deeply,</p>
<p>in order to replace sleep that you&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>It also seems to aid neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>It can enhance the rearrangements of connections</p>
<p>in the brain that occur during learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s scientific support for that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a link in today&rsquo;s episode caption to a new site.</p>
<p>This is a YouTube video that was brought free of cost</p>
<p>by the folks over at Made For,</p>
<p>a company that&rsquo;s been a sponsor of the podcast previously.</p>
<p>So this is an NSDR script</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t contain any of the intentions</p>
<p>or some of the more typical language of yoga nidra.</p>
<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s focused purely on the breathing protocols,</p>
<p>as well as includes a sort of body scan,</p>
<p>where you direct your attention</p>
<p>to different locations around your body.</p>
<p>It has all the core elements of non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>but is distinct from yoga nidra.</p>
<p>I just offer this to you as a resource,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 30 minutes long and should be very effective</p>
<p>in bringing you into deep states of relaxation</p>
<p>for all the reasons I mentioned before.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about emotions.</p>
<p>Emotions are a fascinating and vital aspect</p>
<p>of our life experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that emotions make up</p>
<p>most of what we think of as our experience of life.</p>
<p>Even the things we do, our behaviors,</p>
<p>and the places we go,</p>
<p>and the people we end up encountering in our life,</p>
<p>all of that really funnels into our emotional perception</p>
<p>of what those things mean,</p>
<p>whether or not they made us happy or sad or depressed</p>
<p>or lonely, or we&rsquo;re awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that is absolutely true</p>
<p>is that everyone&rsquo;s perception of emotion</p>
<p>is slightly different.</p>
<p>Meaning your idea of happy is very likely different</p>
<p>than my idea of what a state of happiness is.</p>
<p>And we know this also for color vision, for instance.</p>
<p>Even though the cells in your eye and my eye</p>
<p>that perceive the color red are identical</p>
<p>right down to the genes that they express,</p>
<p>we can be certain based on experimental evidence,</p>
<p>what are called psychophysical studies,</p>
<p>that your idea of the most intense red</p>
<p>is going to be very different than my idea</p>
<p>of the most intense red,</p>
<p>if we were given a selection of 10 different reds</p>
<p>and asked which one is most intense,</p>
<p>which one looks most red.</p>
<p>And that seems crazy.</p>
<p>You would think that something as simple as color</p>
<p>would be universal, and yet it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And so we need to agree at the outset</p>
<p>that emotions are complicated,</p>
<p>and yet they are tractable, they can be understood.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk about a lot of tools</p>
<p>to understand what emotions are</p>
<p>for you to understand what your emotional states mean</p>
<p>and what they don&rsquo;t mean.</p>
<p>And in doing that, that will allow you to place a value</p>
<p>on whether or not you should hold an emotional state</p>
<p>as true or not true,</p>
<p>whether or not it has meaning or it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>as well as whether or not the emotions of others</p>
<p>are important to you in a given context.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about development.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re going to center a lot of our discussion today</p>
<p>around infancy and puberty.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about tools</p>
<p>for enhancing one&rsquo;s emotional range</p>
<p>and for navigating difficult emotional situations.</p>
<p>I am not a clinical psychologist, I&rsquo;m not a therapist,</p>
<p>but I do have some background in psychology.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m going to be drawing from the psychology greats</p>
<p>not me, but from the greats of psychology</p>
<p>who studied emotion, who studied emotional development</p>
<p>and linking that to the neuroscience of emotion.</p>
<p>Because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals</p>
<p>and the hormones and the neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body that underlie emotion.</p>
<p>So while there&rsquo;s no one single universally true theory</p>
<p>of emotion at the intersection</p>
<p>of many of the existing theories,</p>
<p>there are really some ground truths.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to visit those ground truths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about the tools that emerge from them.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about some absolutely wild</p>
<p>and wacky experiments that people are doing out there</p>
<p>right now that I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend you do</p>
<p>of inhaling different types of hormones</p>
<p>and trying to get attached more quickly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually going to do some experiential stuff today.</p>
<p>If you like, there&rsquo;s some things that you can do</p>
<p>in real time while listening to the podcast</p>
<p>in order to tap into some of the mechanisms</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll be referring to.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s going to be very interactive</p>
<p>in a way that previous podcast episodes have not.</p>
<p>If we want to understand emotions,</p>
<p>we have to look at where emotions first develop.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a critical central theme.</p>
<p>If you want to understand brain science and psychology</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a rule in neuroanatomy</p>
<p>because if you look at 50 different brains of humans</p>
<p>or you compare the brains of dogs and humans,</p>
<p>there are a lot of differences.</p>
<p>Certain things are the same,</p>
<p>but certain things are different.</p>
<p>And the rule that every good neuroanatomist knows</p>
<p>is that if you want to understand</p>
<p>what a part of the brain does,</p>
<p>you have to address two questions.</p>
<p>First, you have to know what connections</p>
<p>does that brain area make?</p>
<p>What is it connected to?</p>
<p>Where does it get inputs from?</p>
<p>And where does it send inputs?</p>
<p>So for instance, if there&rsquo;s an area of the brain</p>
<p>that gets direct input from the neurons in the nose,</p>
<p>you can be pretty certain that it has some role</p>
<p>in analyzing smell, in measuring something about odors</p>
<p>or analyzing something about odors.</p>
<p>Now, if it also gets input from the eye,</p>
<p>you can also conclude that it gets input</p>
<p>from the visual system,</p>
<p>that it cares about light and photons.</p>
<p>This is sort of obvious.</p>
<p>And yet you need to know that connectivity</p>
<p>and you need to know what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the developmental origin of that structure.</p>
<p>You need to know where it was early in development</p>
<p>because things move around a lot as the brain develops.</p>
<p>The brain, of course, is this more or less squishy thing</p>
<p>floating around in some liquid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stuffed inside your skull.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, things move around a lot.</p>
<p>They are not always in the same place</p>
<p>in two different species</p>
<p>or two individuals of the same species.</p>
<p>So you have to know where they started out</p>
<p>because where they started out</p>
<p>informs what they do as well.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re talking about emotions,</p>
<p>we cannot point to one area of the brain.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s the area of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsible for emotions.</p>
<p>There is this so-called limbic system</p>
<p>that has been linked to emotions in various ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna talk about that today.</p>
<p>But the limbic system is just one component</p>
<p>of the inputs to create emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the place for emotions.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go in and lesion one location in the brain</p>
<p>and eliminate emotions entirely.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>So first of all, we have to ask,</p>
<p>what are the circuits for emotion?</p>
<p>What are the brain areas for emotion?</p>
<p>And nowadays there&rsquo;s a lot of debate about this.</p>
<p>For years, it was thought that there might be circuits,</p>
<p>meaning connections in the brain</p>
<p>that generate the feeling of being happy</p>
<p>or circuits that generate the feeling of being sad, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been challenged.</p>
<p>In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett</p>
<p>has been the person who&rsquo;s really challenged this head-on</p>
<p>and has very good evidence for the fact</p>
<p>that such circuits probably don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And yet I think there&rsquo;s good evidence</p>
<p>for circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>such as limbic circuits and other circuits</p>
<p>that shift our overall states</p>
<p>or our overall level of alertness or calmness,</p>
<p>or whether or not they bias us</p>
<p>toward viewing the outside world</p>
<p>or paying more attention to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>inside our bodies.</p>
<p>If none of this makes sense right now,</p>
<p>I promise it will make sense soon.</p>
<p>But the important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that emotions do arise in the brain and body.</p>
<p>They arise because there are specific connections</p>
<p>between specific areas in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And if we want to understand how emotions work,</p>
<p>we have to look how emotions are built.</p>
<p>And they are built during infancy, adolescence, and puberty.</p>
<p>And then it continues into adulthood,</p>
<p>but the groundwork is laid down early in development</p>
<p>when we are small children.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about what happens to a baby</p>
<p>that comes into the world.</p>
<p>A baby comes into the world,</p>
<p>you were born into this world</p>
<p>without really any understanding of the things around you.</p>
<p>Now, there are two ways that you can interact with the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re always doing them more or less</p>
<p>to some degree at the same time.</p>
<p>Those are interoception,</p>
<p>paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on inside you,</p>
<p>what you feel internally,</p>
<p>and exteroception,</p>
<p>paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on outside you.</p>
<p>Hold that in mind, please,</p>
<p>because the fact that you&rsquo;re both interocepting</p>
<p>and exterocepting is true for your entire life</p>
<p>and it sets the foundation for understanding emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely critical.</p>
<p>As an infant,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have any knowledge of what you needed.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t understand hunger,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t understand toys</p>
<p>when you first came into the world,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t understand cold or heat or any of that.</p>
<p>When you needed something,</p>
<p>you experienced that as anxiety.</p>
<p>You would feel an increase in alertness</p>
<p>if you had to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>you would feel an increase in alertness if you were hungry,</p>
<p>and you would vocalize, you would cry out,</p>
<p>you would act agitated,</p>
<p>you might coo,</p>
<p>you might do a number of different things,</p>
<p>but all you knew was what you were feeling internally,</p>
<p>and then your caregiver,</p>
<p>whoever that might&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>would respond to that.</p>
<p>So you would feel some agitation,</p>
<p>a caregiver would come and make a decision.</p>
<p>Oh, you need food and give you milk,</p>
<p>or change your diaper,</p>
<p>or wrap you in a blanket if you were cold.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t know if you were cold,</p>
<p>they could just assume that you were cold.</p>
<p>So this is actually really important to understand</p>
<p>that a baby, when you were a baby and when I was a baby,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have any sense of the outside world</p>
<p>except that it responded to our acts of anxiety essentially.</p>
<p>Now this isn&rsquo;t Freudian theory, right?</p>
<p>There are components of it</p>
<p>that are embedded in Freudian theory,</p>
<p>but all developmental psychologists agree</p>
<p>that babies lack the ability</p>
<p>to make cognitive sense of the outside world.</p>
<p>But in this feeling of anxiety</p>
<p>and registering one&rsquo;s own internal state</p>
<p>and then crying out to the outside world,</p>
<p>either through crying or subtle vocalizations,</p>
<p>or even just cooing, making some noise,</p>
<p>we start to develop a relationship with the outside world</p>
<p>in which our internal states, our shifts in anxiety,</p>
<p>start to drive requests</p>
<p>and people come and respond to those requests, hopefully.</p>
<p>And the reason I say hopefully is that we&rsquo;ve all heard,</p>
<p>presumably about these cases of neglect.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cases where if you neglect a baby,</p>
<p>you neglect an adolescent or a teenager,</p>
<p>development doesn&rsquo;t go well.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll touch on some of those,</p>
<p>but those are really extreme cases.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of like the parallel to experiments</p>
<p>that are often done in the laboratory with animals,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve probably heard of these enriched environments</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll give mice a bunch of toys</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give them some different foods</p>
<p>every once in a while</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll house them together with other mice.</p>
<p>And what you find is that the animals,</p>
<p>they will say, oh, you know, their brain is thicker</p>
<p>and their neurons have more branches to them and all that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really comparing deprivation with normalcy.</p>
<p>What we want to center on today instead</p>
<p>is what happens when things go well</p>
<p>and why things might not go well</p>
<p>in certain circumstances is interesting,</p>
<p>but to me, not as interesting</p>
<p>as what healthy emotional development looks like.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t achieved healthy emotional development,</p>
<p>what can be done as an intervention at later times</p>
<p>in order to rescue that?</p>
<p>So the baby, you as a baby,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re flopping around there in your crib,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting care where you need it</p>
<p>and when you need it, presumably.</p>
<p>And this gets to the basis of what emotions are about,</p>
<p>which are emotions are really about forming bonds</p>
<p>and being able to predict things in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what emotions are about.</p>
<p>Whether or not the baby feels angry or happy or sad,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We can guess, but we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time, we don&rsquo;t even know how we feel,</p>
<p>let alone how other people feel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true for adults.</p>
<p>So if I ask you how you feel right now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that you could tell me</p>
<p>in any kind of rich language that I would say,</p>
<p>oh, I really understand.</p>
<p>If you said you were very, very depressed</p>
<p>or very, very happy, I&rsquo;d have some sense</p>
<p>because of how extreme that is,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know that I would really know.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you know how I feel right now either.</p>
<p>I could be furious right now or I could be very happy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any idea.</p>
<p>Of course, we have these things called expressions.</p>
<p>Our pupils dilate.</p>
<p>There are various cues of how people feel.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about those cues,</p>
<p>but you really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And at this point, I actually just want to pause</p>
<p>and mention a really interesting tool</p>
<p>that is trying to address this question</p>
<p>of what are emotions and what do they consist of</p>
<p>that you can use if you like.</p>
<p>This is an app.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t develop it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any relationship to them,</p>
<p>but the app was developed by people at Yale,</p>
<p>by groups at Yale who do research,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called Mood Meter.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually quite interesting.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s either free or it&rsquo;s 99 cents.</p>
<p>Again, no business relationship to them,</p>
<p>but what they&rsquo;re trying to do is put more nuance,</p>
<p>more subtlety on our words and our language for emotions</p>
<p>and be able to allow you to predict</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to feel in the future.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually quite interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the app right now, and I know you can&rsquo;t see this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called Mood Meter,</p>
<p>and you can find it on Apple or Android.</p>
<p>And you go into it and it asks you,</p>
<p>it says to me, hi, Andrew, how are you right now?</p>
<p>And I click the little tab that says, I feel,</p>
<p>and I can either pick high energy and unpleasant,</p>
<p>high energy and pleasant,</p>
<p>low energy, unpleasant, or low energy, pleasant.</p>
<p>And I would say right now, I feel high energy, pleasant.</p>
<p>So I just revealed to you how I feel.</p>
<p>So I click on that,</p>
<p>and then it gives you a gallery of colors</p>
<p>and you just move your finger to the location</p>
<p>where you think it matches most.</p>
<p>And as you do that, little words pop up.</p>
<p>I know some people are looking at this on,</p>
<p>or listening to this on audio only.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll say motivated, cheerful, inspired.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;m feeling right now, cheerful.</p>
<p>So you click that,</p>
<p>and then you just go to the next window</p>
<p>and it just says, what are you doing?</p>
<p>And this feels like play to me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to call it work.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And then what it does</p>
<p>is it basically starts to collect data on you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving it information,</p>
<p>and it starts to link that to other features</p>
<p>that you allow it access to, if you like.</p>
<p>And it starts helping you be able to predict</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to feel at different times a day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite accurate in certain ways,</p>
<p>quite interesting.</p>
<p>And it points to a couple of really interesting features,</p>
<p>which is that we don&rsquo;t really have enough language</p>
<p>to describe all the emotional states.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s some core truths</p>
<p>to what makes up an emotion.</p>
<p>And I want to review that twice during today&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>because this can really help people,</p>
<p>kids and adults, understand better what they&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>and why, and when best to engage in certain activities,</p>
<p>and thankfully, when best to avoid certain activities too.</p>
<p>So the way this works is the following.</p>
<p>You need to ask yourself at any point,</p>
<p>you could do this right now if you like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your level of autonomic arousal?</p>
<p>Autonomic arousal is just the continuum,</p>
<p>the range of alert to calm.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a panic right now,</p>
<p>you are like 10 out of 10 on the arousal scale.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re asleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not comprehending what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>although maybe a little bit,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re very drowsy,</p>
<p>you might be at a one or a two.</p>
<p>So you always have to ask,</p>
<p>where are you on the arousal scale?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other axis, this other question,</p>
<p>which is what we call valence.</p>
<p>Now valence is a value.</p>
<p>Do you feel good or bad?</p>
<p>I would say I feel pretty good right now</p>
<p>on a scale of one to 10.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know, I feel like a seven.</p>
<p>I got a good night&rsquo;s sleep last night,</p>
<p>had a good walk with Costello this morning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fed, I&rsquo;m hydrated, I feel good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like a seven.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m alert and I feel pretty good.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a third thing,</p>
<p>which is how much we are interocepting</p>
<p>and how much we are exterocepting, all right?</p>
<p>So how much our attention is focused internally</p>
<p>on what we&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>and how much it&rsquo;s focused externally.</p>
<p>And this is always going to be in a dynamic balance.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re really, really stressed,</p>
<p>oftentimes that puts you in a position</p>
<p>to be really in touch with what&rsquo;s going on in your body.</p>
<p>If you start having a lot of somatic,</p>
<p>a lot of bodily sensations,</p>
<p>like your heart is beating so fast that you can&rsquo;t ignore it,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re really strongly interoceptive.</p>
<p>But also sometimes you&rsquo;re really stressed</p>
<p>because someone&rsquo;s stressing you out</p>
<p>or somebody sends you a text message</p>
<p>or makes a comment about a YouTube thing you posted</p>
<p>or something and you&rsquo;re really triggered by it.</p>
<p>That never happens to me.</p>
<p>But if it does happen to you, then you&rsquo;re exterocepting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these three things,</p>
<p>how alert or sleepy you are, that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>How good or bad you feel, that&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>And then whether or not most of your attention</p>
<p>is directed outward or whether or not it&rsquo;s directed inward.</p>
<p>And much of what we call emotions</p>
<p>are made up by those three things.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s return now to development,</p>
<p>but tuck that away and just kind of think about it.</p>
<p>Alert versus asleep, good versus bad,</p>
<p>and focused internally or focused externally.</p>
<p>Because when I looked at the whole of all the theories</p>
<p>of emotion that were out there,</p>
<p>there were a lot of different components to them,</p>
<p>but they all seem to center back</p>
<p>to these same three features in some way</p>
<p>or to some degree or another.</p>
<p>And it can be very powerful to understand</p>
<p>and look at your emotions through that lens.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s return to the infant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the baby in the crib.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly interocepting.</p>
<p>As caregivers bring it what it needs, you hope,</p>
<p>milk, diaper changes, et cetera,</p>
<p>a warm blanket if it&rsquo;s cold,</p>
<p>pull off the blanket when the baby&rsquo;s fussing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s too warm, because babies get too warm also.</p>
<p>It starts to exterocept, excuse me, I misspoke.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>It starts to exterocept.</p>
<p>The baby starts to look into the outside world</p>
<p>and start making predictions.</p>
<p>It starts wondering how much it needs to cry</p>
<p>or predicting, well, if I cry like a little bit,</p>
<p>then mom comes over and I get my milk.</p>
<p>Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn&rsquo;t come over and give me milk.</p>
<p>So I need to really scream at the top of my head.</p>
<p>So babies are starting to evaluate and do all this,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not doing it consciously.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing this strategically</p>
<p>in order to relieve anxiety.</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t propose that that&rsquo;s what we do into adulthood,</p>
<p>but a lot of what we do in adulthood</p>
<p>is when we feel something, we start exterocepting.</p>
<p>Some people are much better at just sitting as a container</p>
<p>and just interocepting and paying attention</p>
<p>to what they&rsquo;re feeling internally.</p>
<p>But most people do a little bit of a balance of both.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t feel good, so we look for an item of food</p>
<p>that might make us feel better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re feeling anxious, heading into the dentist</p>
<p>or something like that, so we text somebody.</p>
<p>We do this almost reflexively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always conscious.</p>
<p>So infants do this, and we continue to do this.</p>
<p>We start to now balance our interoceptive</p>
<p>and exteroceptive focus,</p>
<p>our looking inward and looking outward.</p>
<p>And as we do that, we&rsquo;re starting to figure out</p>
<p>what gets our needs met.</p>
<p>Remember, emotions are really there to form bonds</p>
<p>and to make predictions.</p>
<p>And so our needs are going to be met to some degree or not.</p>
<p>Sometimes, sadly, there is neglect.</p>
<p>Sometimes people don&rsquo;t show up for us</p>
<p>the way that we would like.</p>
<p>And in general, our responses to that</p>
<p>have to do with whether or not we predict</p>
<p>whether or not they would or not.</p>
<p>When we expect something and it doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big letdown.</p>
<p>That was the discussion about dopamine last episode.</p>
<p>So the many theories of emotion,</p>
<p>the triune brain theory that you have a primitive</p>
<p>and evolved brain,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s a little bit on shaky ground these days,</p>
<p>the idea that Darwin proposed</p>
<p>that there are these universal expressions of emotions,</p>
<p>the work of Helen Fisher on love,</p>
<p>that you have circuits in the brain for lust,</p>
<p>circuits in the brain for love,</p>
<p>and circuits in the brain for long-term bonds,</p>
<p>as well as the work of Lisa Feldman Barrett</p>
<p>saying that emotions are contextual,</p>
<p>that they have a social component.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be talking more about this,</p>
<p>but the work of Alan Shore,</p>
<p>a clinical psychologist and researcher at UCLA</p>
<p>about right brain, left brain,</p>
<p>and its role in emotional development,</p>
<p>all of them have strong elements of this idea</p>
<p>of paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on inward and outward.</p>
<p>As a young creature, an infant and young toddler,</p>
<p>you were mainly focused inward</p>
<p>and you started to understand what was going on outward</p>
<p>as a way of predicting what would bring you relief,</p>
<p>what would remove your anxiety.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the fundamental rules of your experience,</p>
<p>your emotional experience were laid down.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that&rsquo;s a lot of information</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s somewhat of an academic talk,</p>
<p>but there were two tools in there</p>
<p>that I just want to highlight.</p>
<p>One is the Mood Meter app, if you&rsquo;re interested in it,</p>
<p>can give you some insight</p>
<p>into the different kinds of nuance within emotions</p>
<p>and allow you to actually predict emotional states.</p>
<p>If you want to try that,</p>
<p>you might find that interesting.</p>
<p>The other one is this idea</p>
<p>that there are three axes to emotion,</p>
<p>three continuum that interact,</p>
<p>the level of alertness and calmness,</p>
<p>how good or bad you feel,</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re mainly focused inward or outward,</p>
<p>because those are going to form a useful toolkit</p>
<p>for the information going forward.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about what kind of baby you were,</p>
<p>because that actually informs your emotionality now.</p>
<p>These are classic, they&rsquo;re actually famous experiments</p>
<p>done by Bowlby and Ainsworth.</p>
<p>Anyone that studied psychology</p>
<p>or has taken a psychology class</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve learned about this.</p>
<p>This is this classic experiment</p>
<p>of what was called the strange situation task,</p>
<p>in which, and I&rsquo;m describing it very coarsely here,</p>
<p>I realize, but a mother and child come into the laboratory.</p>
<p>Yes, this has now also been done with fathers.</p>
<p>The baby and the mother or father play together for a bit,</p>
<p>and then the mother leaves.</p>
<p>The mother leaves for some period of time</p>
<p>and then comes back.</p>
<p>And the research is devoted to understanding</p>
<p>the response of the child when the caretaker,</p>
<p>the mother or the father, returns.</p>
<p>Most all children, not every child,</p>
<p>but most children will cry</p>
<p>when their primary caretaker leaves.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>And there are good reasons for that.</p>
<p>They formed a bond and an attachment,</p>
<p>and we will talk about some of the deeper chemical reasons</p>
<p>for those bonds.</p>
<p>However, the experiment is focused</p>
<p>on the return of the caregiver,</p>
<p>because Bowlby and Ainsworth</p>
<p>and many of their scientific offspring and colleagues</p>
<p>identified at least four patterns</p>
<p>that babies display when their caretaker returns.</p>
<p>And they grouped these into group A, B, C, D,</p>
<p>so much so that the kids were referred to as A babies,</p>
<p>B babies, C babies, or D babies.</p>
<p>You may know which one you were,</p>
<p>but the categories are really interesting.</p>
<p>The first babies are the A babies.</p>
<p>So these were kids that would get upset</p>
<p>when their caretaker would leave,</p>
<p>but when their caretaker would return,</p>
<p>the infant would respond with happiness,</p>
<p>with what looked like delight.</p>
<p>They would go to the caretaker, they seemed happy.</p>
<p>If they had been fussy before or sad, they felt relieved.</p>
<p>These are referred to as secure attached kids.</p>
<p>So they have a healthy response to separation,</p>
<p>and they have a healthy response</p>
<p>to re-engaging with the caretaker.</p>
<p>The B babies, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver</p>
<p>when the caregiver would return.</p>
<p>So they would sometimes continue to play with their toys,</p>
<p>or they had an adult in the room while the parent was gone,</p>
<p>they would stay with them.</p>
<p>It was sometimes complicated and nuanced,</p>
<p>but these were referred to as avoidant babies.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t run away with any conclusions</p>
<p>about the language here just yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that avoidant babies</p>
<p>become avoidant adults, but bear with me.</p>
<p>The C babies would respond to the return of the caregiver</p>
<p>with acts of annoyance.</p>
<p>They seemed kind of angry, right?</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t that they ignored them,</p>
<p>they seemed kind of angry.</p>
<p>And those were referred to as ambivalent babies.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with A babies,</p>
<p>these are the C babies were the ambivalent babies.</p>
<p>So the infant&rsquo;s reaction to the returning caregiver</p>
<p>were inconsistent.</p>
<p>It seemed like they wanted to bond with them again,</p>
<p>but that they seemed kind of annoyed.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve all felt this way before</p>
<p>with people that we care very much about,</p>
<p>especially people we care very much about.</p>
<p>And then the third category, the D babies,</p>
<p>were the disorganized babies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they called them.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t disorganized in that they were messy.</p>
<p>The child avoided interactions with everyone</p>
<p>and acted fearful when the caregiver returned.</p>
<p>And their behavior didn&rsquo;t really change</p>
<p>whether or not the caregiver was there or not.</p>
<p>And that fourth category</p>
<p>was actually added rather late</p>
<p>in the course of this research.</p>
<p>I should mention these experiments have been repeated</p>
<p>with a huge variety of different contexts.</p>
<p>There was work done by Mary Main at UC Berkeley</p>
<p>and many others,</p>
<p>looking at all sorts of variations on this theme.</p>
<p>But over time, it made it clear that certain babies</p>
<p>are able to feel secure upon re-engaging</p>
<p>with their caregiver and others don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re confused about it.</p>
<p>So we probably don&rsquo;t know whether or not</p>
<p>you were an A, a B, or a C, a D baby,</p>
<p>unless you were in these experiments</p>
<p>and somehow you had that knowledge.</p>
<p>But this work, this classic work,</p>
<p>opened up a huge set of important questions</p>
<p>that related to what is the reestablishment</p>
<p>of the bond really about?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s actually being figured out here</p>
<p>is not whether or not there are four categories of babies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But it presumably is more interesting to focus on</p>
<p>what is it that defines a really good bond,</p>
<p>a secure attachment, or an insecure attachment,</p>
<p>or an avoidant attachment?</p>
<p>And the four things are gaze, literally eye contact,</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have to be direct beaming eye contact</p>
<p>with no blinks like people have accused me of before.</p>
<p>It can just be gaze that, you know,</p>
<p>people look at each other.</p>
<p>You see couples, they look at each other.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t always stare each other long periods of time.</p>
<p>Sometimes they do.</p>
<p>Vocalizations, so what we say and how we say it.</p>
<p>Affect or emotion, so the way that we express,</p>
<p>you know, crying, smiling, et cetera.</p>
<p>And touch, those four things.</p>
<p>And you probably could add a fifth dimension</p>
<p>once language and written language develops,</p>
<p>which is written word.</p>
<p>Exchange of letters, exchange of texts,</p>
<p>exchange of things of that sort, emails,</p>
<p>are another way in which people can bond.</p>
<p>But gaze, vocalization, affect, and touch</p>
<p>are really the core of this thing</p>
<p>that we call social bonds and emotionality.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>We know, for instance, that there are brain areas</p>
<p>like the fusiform face area, which is deep in the brain,</p>
<p>that is responsible for the processing of faces.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s recognition of their parents&rsquo; faces and voices</p>
<p>is extremely accurate and strong.</p>
<p>Likewise, parents&rsquo; recognition</p>
<p>of their child&rsquo;s vocalizations, not just voices,</p>
<p>but cries are remarkable.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had the experience of being at a party</p>
<p>with somebody who has small children</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking to them,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden they hear something, but you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;ve got wolf hearing.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden they go running into the other room</p>
<p>and indeed, you know, the kid is like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>some kid is beating up their kid</p>
<p>or their kid&rsquo;s beating up some other kid</p>
<p>or the kid has injured themselves</p>
<p>or feels emotionally injured.</p>
<p>This perception of voices,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very good evidence to support the fact</p>
<p>that we are tuned to the frequencies of voices</p>
<p>and vocalizations of people that we care about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just true in rodents</p>
<p>and in birds and other mammals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely true in humans as well.</p>
<p>And babies are very tuned in</p>
<p>to the sound of their mother&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Even, yes, while they&rsquo;re in the womb,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this whole world of what&rsquo;s called motherese,</p>
<p>which is the particular style of speech</p>
<p>that mothers and other caretakers now we know</p>
<p>use with children.</p>
<p>So those are the core elements, right?</p>
<p>How you look at somebody and how they look at you,</p>
<p>what you say, what they say,</p>
<p>what they seem to be feeling</p>
<p>and how that makes you feel, smiles, frowns.</p>
<p>If you know someone really well,</p>
<p>you can read inflections in like even little subtle things</p>
<p>like, you know, they don&rsquo;t really believe me</p>
<p>or, oh, they&rsquo;re really excited by this</p>
<p>or, oh, you know, now I know what they&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>That kind of processing,</p>
<p>some people are better at it than others,</p>
<p>but everyone&rsquo;s better at doing that</p>
<p>with people that we recognize and know.</p>
<p>In fact, couples come to know each other exceedingly well,</p>
<p>so much so that it can both benefit</p>
<p>and injure their relationship</p>
<p>to constantly be making these perceptions.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a range.</p>
<p>Some people are more tuned into this than others.</p>
<p>And that probably has roots in the sorts of attachments</p>
<p>that you form early on.</p>
<p>So Bowlby and colleagues developed these ABCD thing</p>
<p>and it has a lot to do with face processing</p>
<p>and gaze and vocalizations and touch.</p>
<p>All of those happened on return with the mother,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t parsing those.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t looking at them individually.</p>
<p>So this raises a really interesting question,</p>
<p>which is what is it when we feel something?</p>
<p>Is it because of something</p>
<p>that happens spontaneously in us?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a memory or it&rsquo;s something that we realized</p>
<p>we saw on the internet or we got news about somebody.</p>
<p>You know, nowadays people get so much information</p>
<p>about the people they know,</p>
<p>both the people they like and dislike</p>
<p>by way of viewing online activities, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re exterocepting</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s impacting your internal state.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear from most all of the theories</p>
<p>of emotional health,</p>
<p>that an ability to recognize when your own internal state</p>
<p>is being driven primarily by external events</p>
<p>as important for being able to emotionally regulate, right?</p>
<p>People who are constantly being yanked around</p>
<p>by the external happenings in the world,</p>
<p>you would say are emotionally labile.</p>
<p>They are not in control of their emotions.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re calm all the time,</p>
<p>if that calmness only arrives</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in a placid environment</p>
<p>and then you put a cracker in that environment</p>
<p>and they freak out, well, then they&rsquo;re not really calm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re calm insofar as there isn&rsquo;t something disturbing</p>
<p>in the environment.</p>
<p>So how much the outside environment</p>
<p>disrupts your internal environment</p>
<p>has everything to do with this balance</p>
<p>of interoception and exteroception.</p>
<p>And it very likely has roots in whether or not</p>
<p>you were secure attached or insecure attached,</p>
<p>disorganized or ambivalent as a baby.</p>
<p>Of course you can&rsquo;t travel back in time and know,</p>
<p>but there are some hints as to what kind of emotionality</p>
<p>each of us has by examining two periods of development.</p>
<p>One is adolescence and puberty and the other is adulthood.</p>
<p>So while we can&rsquo;t travel back in time,</p>
<p>there is an exercise that you can do</p>
<p>to address at least in this moment,</p>
<p>whether or not you have a bias for exteroception</p>
<p>or a bias for interoception,</p>
<p>whether or not you are better at least in this moment</p>
<p>at paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>internally or externally.</p>
<p>And of course this will vary with circumstance.</p>
<p>I think we all know people that maybe it&rsquo;s you,</p>
<p>you go to a party and you get there</p>
<p>and everyone seems to be talking</p>
<p>and having a really good time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re wondering whether or not</p>
<p>you have any food in your teeth</p>
<p>or whether or not there&rsquo;s something on your face</p>
<p>or whether or not your hair is right</p>
<p>or whether or not you said something the wrong way,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re turning red.</p>
<p>People also experienced this a lot with public speaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about learning to clamp your level of stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about how much you&rsquo;re exterocepting,</p>
<p>how much you&rsquo;re out of your head, they call it,</p>
<p>but how much you&rsquo;re focused on the events around you</p>
<p>versus the events inside you.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s interesting when you talk to people</p>
<p>who are very effective athletes</p>
<p>or they have very high stress, high consequence jobs,</p>
<p>they talk about this notion of getting out of your head.</p>
<p>You only have so much attentional resource</p>
<p>and it can be split between two things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that in a moment.</p>
<p>They can be anchored to one thing.</p>
<p>It can be fully focused on what&rsquo;s going on internally</p>
<p>or it can be fully focused on what&rsquo;s going on externally.</p>
<p>And if you want to be effective in the world,</p>
<p>effective being in quotes,</p>
<p>it is useful when in very dynamic environments,</p>
<p>especially social environments,</p>
<p>to have a lot of your attention focused outward</p>
<p>as opposed to trying to pay attention</p>
<p>to whether or not you&rsquo;re saying things correctly</p>
<p>or the timbre of your own voice.</p>
<p>That is more or less destructive</p>
<p>for the ability to engage socially.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the exercise.</p>
<p>You can do this.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do this if you&rsquo;re driving,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just try and illustrate</p>
<p>or allow you to experience</p>
<p>this interoceptive, exteroceptive balance</p>
<p>and the extent to which you can move interoception</p>
<p>and exteroception deliberately.</p>
<p>If you close your eyes right now</p>
<p>and concentrate on the contact of any portion of your body</p>
<p>with say the chair or your car seat,</p>
<p>although please again, don&rsquo;t do this while you&rsquo;re driving,</p>
<p>anywhere that you are,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re just standing up or you&rsquo;re in the kitchen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lying on the couch</p>
<p>and trying to bring as much of your attention</p>
<p>to that point of contact as possible.</p>
<p>And then from there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to move your attention even more deeply</p>
<p>into say the sensation of what&rsquo;s going on in your gut.</p>
<p>Are you full?</p>
<p>Are you empty?</p>
<p>Are you hungry?</p>
<p>Are you not?</p>
<p>Is your heart beating at what rate?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the cadence of your breathing?</p>
<p>Basically bringing your focus and attention</p>
<p>to everything at the surface of your skin and inward.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to do a rare thing</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to introduce about five to eight seconds of silence</p>
<p>in order to allow you to do that a little bit.</p>
<p>Okay, now this is an exercise</p>
<p>that you can continue afterward</p>
<p>if you want to extend how long you do this,</p>
<p>but now try and do something that for most people</p>
<p>actually is a little bit harder,</p>
<p>which is to purely exterocep,</p>
<p>put your eyes or your ears or both</p>
<p>on anything in your immediate space, one thing.</p>
<p>And I would restrict that thing to something small enough</p>
<p>that at least in your field of view,</p>
<p>it would occupy 20% of your field of view.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a pinpoint</p>
<p>unless the pin is right in front of you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re holding it real close.</p>
<p>I would say, look across the room,</p>
<p>pick a panel on the wall or a leg of a table or something</p>
<p>and try and bring as much of your attention</p>
<p>to that as possible.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll take about five seconds of silence</p>
<p>to allow you to exterocept.</p>
<p>Okay, so what you probably found</p>
<p>is that you were able to do that,</p>
<p>but that some degree of interoception is maintained.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to place 100% of your attention</p>
<p>on something externally,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s really exciting, really novel.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever watched a really great movie,</p>
<p>presumably you&rsquo;re exterocepting</p>
<p>more than you&rsquo;re interocepting</p>
<p>until something exciting happens</p>
<p>and then you feel something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually tethering your emotional experience</p>
<p>to something external.</p>
<p>And now you can also do this dynamically.</p>
<p>You can decide to focus internally and then externally.</p>
<p>You can decide to split it 50%, 50% or 70, 30.</p>
<p>One can develop, you can develop</p>
<p>a heightened ability to do this.</p>
<p>And the power of doing that is actually</p>
<p>that when you are in environments</p>
<p>where you feel like you&rsquo;re focused too much internally</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d like to be focused more externally,</p>
<p>you can actually do that deliberately.</p>
<p>But as you&rsquo;ve noticed, it takes work.</p>
<p>It involves taking your attentional spotlight</p>
<p>and what we call the aperture of your attention</p>
<p>and narrowing that aperture to either the self</p>
<p>or something externally or splitting the two.</p>
<p>And yet there are practices that have been developed</p>
<p>that center on moving interoception and exteroception</p>
<p>from one being more heavily weighted than the other,</p>
<p>more focused outward or more focused inward.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s dynamic.</p>
<p>And the circuits in the brain that underlie intero</p>
<p>and exteroception aren&rsquo;t exactly known,</p>
<p>but they are anchored in the areas of the brain</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re involved in attention,</p>
<p>like the frontal eye fields and areas</p>
<p>that when you third person yourself,</p>
<p>when you can see yourself doing something,</p>
<p>like if you put your hand out in your environment</p>
<p>and you focus on your hand,</p>
<p>you know that that&rsquo;s your hand</p>
<p>as opposed to some random object.</p>
<p>There are areas of the brain they&rsquo;re involved in that,</p>
<p>in recognizing location of self</p>
<p>relative to the rest of your body.</p>
<p>These exercises are really what are at the core</p>
<p>of these development of emotional bonds.</p>
<p>Because as we mentioned before, these four things,</p>
<p>the gaze, vocalization, touch, and affect,</p>
<p>those are happening very dynamically.</p>
<p>So if somebody winks at you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re paying attention to their wink,</p>
<p>but then you also notice how you feel.</p>
<p>Then they might say something.</p>
<p>Then you might say something.</p>
<p>This is very dynamic.</p>
<p>So if it seems overwhelming to try and interocept</p>
<p>and exterocept and then shift the balance,</p>
<p>you do that all the time.</p>
<p>Your brain and nervous system are fantastic at doing this.</p>
<p>Now, some people have a very hard time</p>
<p>breaking out of a very strongly interoceptive mode.</p>
<p>Some people have a harder time</p>
<p>breaking out of their exteroceptive mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to note the extent to which</p>
<p>we have biases in how interoceptive or exteroceptive we are.</p>
<p>Remember those three axes that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>You have valence, good or bad.</p>
<p>You have alertness, alert or calm.</p>
<p>And you have interoceptive or exteroceptive bias, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to differ across the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to differ across the lifetime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly going to differ</p>
<p>according to whatever it is that you&rsquo;re engaged in.</p>
<p>But early in development,</p>
<p>you start off with this interoceptive bias.</p>
<p>You are starting to develop expectations,</p>
<p>predictions about how the outside world is going to work.</p>
<p>And you are trying to figure out the reliability</p>
<p>of outside events and people.</p>
<p>And where things are reliable, when people are reliable,</p>
<p>we are able to give up more of our interoception.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally trust that our interoceptive needs,</p>
<p>our internal needs will be met</p>
<p>through bonds and actions of others.</p>
<p>This starts to veer toward</p>
<p>the discussion about neglect and trauma.</p>
<p>We are going to devote entire episodes,</p>
<p>probably an entire month to trauma and PTSD.</p>
<p>But those have roots in what we&rsquo;re talking about now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to internalize</p>
<p>and understand what we&rsquo;re talking about now</p>
<p>in order to get the most out of those future conversations.</p>
<p>So, if all of this seems like a lot of information</p>
<p>and very complicated,</p>
<p>I just invite you to pay attention from time to time,</p>
<p>how much you happen to be interocepting or exterocepting.</p>
<p>Because emotions and the intensity of those emotions</p>
<p>will grow or shrink</p>
<p>depending on how much we&rsquo;re interocepting.</p>
<p>If we are feeling extremely sad</p>
<p>and there is an outside event that made us sad,</p>
<p>chances are there&rsquo;s going to be a balance,</p>
<p>but that the extreme grief, the extreme sadness</p>
<p>is going to lead us to mostly interocept.</p>
<p>Whereas when we&rsquo;re feeling extremely happy,</p>
<p>the same is true.</p>
<p>Something great happens in the world</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just going to feel it.</p>
<p>Most of our perception,</p>
<p>most of our awareness is going to be on an internal state.</p>
<p>So, we are always tethered to the outside world</p>
<p>to some degree or another.</p>
<p>That was true when you were an infant</p>
<p>and it was true when you were an adolescent</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true as an adult.</p>
<p>So, now I want to just pause,</p>
<p>just shelve the discussion about interoception,</p>
<p>exteroception for a moment.</p>
<p>And I want to talk about what is arguably the second most,</p>
<p>if not equally important aspect of your development</p>
<p>as it relates to emotionality.</p>
<p>And as it relates to this, what I call trust,</p>
<p>but this ability to predict</p>
<p>whether or not things in the outside world are reliable</p>
<p>or not reliable in terms of their ability</p>
<p>to help you meet your interoceptive needs.</p>
<p>And that period is puberty.</p>
<p>So, up until now, we&rsquo;ve been talking mainly about psychology,</p>
<p>not a lot of biology, not a lot of mechanism.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re going to transition</p>
<p>into talking about mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera.</p>
<p>Puberty is a absolute biological event.</p>
<p>It has a beginning and it has a specific definition,</p>
<p>which is the transition into reproductive maturity.</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of hormonal changes.</p>
<p>Yes, there are also a lot of brain changes</p>
<p>and most people don&rsquo;t realize it,</p>
<p>but the brain changes occur first.</p>
<p>The brain turns on the hormone systems</p>
<p>that allow puberty to occur.</p>
<p>Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays</p>
<p>than it did in the past.</p>
<p>The current numbers that I was able to find</p>
<p>is that in females and girls,</p>
<p>the transition is starting around age 10,</p>
<p>whereas in boys, it&rsquo;s about age 12.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to differ by way</p>
<p>of a number of different factors.</p>
<p>Those are averages.</p>
<p>So, it depends on where you are in the world,</p>
<p>depends on all sorts of things.</p>
<p>One of the primary triggers for puberty</p>
<p>is actually body fat.</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>The peptide hormone, leptin,</p>
<p>some people call it a peptide,</p>
<p>some people call it a hormone,</p>
<p>but it meets both definitions</p>
<p>depending on how you look at it,</p>
<p>is made by fat.</p>
<p>So, leptin had a lot of popularity in the 90s</p>
<p>because it was discovered as being produced by fat</p>
<p>and it was seen in animal studies</p>
<p>that it could promote leanness.</p>
<p>It actually communicates to the brain</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s enough body fat</p>
<p>in order to allow the metabolic factors</p>
<p>and processes to occur to liberate more fat.</p>
<p>This is why people have trouble losing</p>
<p>that last five pounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because leptin levels are very low.</p>
<p>This was actually the basis</p>
<p>for the whole cheat day refeed thing</p>
<p>that the idea was if you eat a lot</p>
<p>for one day a week while dieting hard,</p>
<p>that you can signal to the brain</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s enough leptin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>or whether or not the cheat days</p>
<p>just provided some psychological relief,</p>
<p>probably both.</p>
<p>But in any case, leptin is made by body fat.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s enough leptin,</p>
<p>it signals the brain to trigger puberty.</p>
<p>There was a paper published in the mid 90s</p>
<p>in the journal Science, excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing that leptin could be injected</p>
<p>into younger females</p>
<p>that would not have yet gone into puberty</p>
<p>and you could accelerate the onset of puberty with leptin.</p>
<p>So more body fat, the earlier puberty, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Leptin is also involved</p>
<p>in various growth effects in the body generally.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, very obese children</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily undergo puberty earlier.</p>
<p>Sometimes they do, but they do tend to be larger boned.</p>
<p>Their bones actually grow more quickly</p>
<p>and they tend to have higher bone density</p>
<p>because leptin is also involved in bone density.</p>
<p>The whole issue of onset of puberty</p>
<p>also has some really interesting social effects.</p>
<p>And I want to really highlight</p>
<p>that most of these effects are so-called pheromone effects.</p>
<p>Remember a hormone is a substance</p>
<p>secreted from one area of the body,</p>
<p>travels and impacts tissues</p>
<p>and cells elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>A pheromone is a chemical that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>by one member of a species that goes and acts on</p>
<p>and impacts other members of that species</p>
<p>or even other species.</p>
<p>So for instance, rodents are very good</p>
<p>at detecting the urine and the scent markings</p>
<p>of large carnivores that want to eat them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a pheromonal interaction.</p>
<p>Whether or not there are pheromonal effects</p>
<p>in humans is very debated.</p>
<p>I did a post on this on Instagram a little while ago</p>
<p>about some pheromone effects that were reported in humans.</p>
<p>And I had a couple of people come at me saying,</p>
<p>look, it&rsquo;s never really been shown in humans</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a pheromonal,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the vomeronasal organ.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called Jacobson&rsquo;s organ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rudimentary.</p>
<p>Some people have it, some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Very controversial.</p>
<p>So I want to point out that human pheromone effects</p>
<p>are controversial, although I think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>in my opinion, there&rsquo;s ample evidence for them.</p>
<p>Synchronization of menstrual cycles for many people report.</p>
<p>Then people say there&rsquo;s some studies</p>
<p>that show that it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;ve been some data showing very impressive</p>
<p>pheromonal effects of female partners</p>
<p>being able to detect the odor of their significant others</p>
<p>on t-shirts that were washed several times.</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t consciously perceive it,</p>
<p>but they say this one smells like them.</p>
<p>This one smells like my partner.</p>
<p>And indeed, the match was way above chance.</p>
<p>So there does seem to be weak pheromonal effects,</p>
<p>at least in my opinion, when I look at the data,</p>
<p>but much more needs to be done.</p>
<p>So one of the more interesting pheromone effects</p>
<p>that impacts puberty, at least in animal models,</p>
<p>is the so-called Vandenberg effect,</p>
<p>which is if you take a pre-pubertal female,</p>
<p>so a female that has not undergone sexual maturation,</p>
<p>and you introduce a novel male that is not the father</p>
<p>or a brother, not a sibling,</p>
<p>she will undergo puberty almost immediately.</p>
<p>So this is really striking.</p>
<p>For years, this was thought not to occur in primate species,</p>
<p>but there was a paper published last year</p>
<p>in Current Biology, Cell Press Journal,</p>
<p>excellent journal, showing that mandrills,</p>
<p>a particular type of primate,</p>
<p>they exhibit this Vandenberg effect.</p>
<p>There are also all sorts of other pheromone effects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the most infamous one is called the Bruce effect,</p>
<p>where the introduction of a novel male</p>
<p>to a pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage.</p>
<p>And that effect seems to be protected against</p>
<p>by the presence of the father.</p>
<p>So another, you know, these interpretation of this,</p>
<p>and I want to really highlight that this is,</p>
<p>these are animal studies,</p>
<p>but the way this works is that if a pregnant female</p>
<p>is in the company of the male that impregnated her,</p>
<p>then her young are protected by his scent presence</p>
<p>or his pheromone presence.</p>
<p>But if he&rsquo;s gone and a novel male shows up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency for her to spontaneously miscarry,</p>
<p>and essentially for the fetus to be lost.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not this occurs in humans</p>
<p>is still very controversial,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, these pheromone effects exist.</p>
<p>And that one is called the Bruce effect,</p>
<p>named after Hilda Bruce,</p>
<p>who is the scientist that discovered it.</p>
<p>The one that&rsquo;s relevant to the puberty discussion</p>
<p>is the Vandenberg effect,</p>
<p>which I mentioned a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>which is a novel male showing up,</p>
<p>has to be a sexually competent male,</p>
<p>so he has to have already passed through puberty.</p>
<p>And his presence triggers activation of puberty</p>
<p>in a female that otherwise would have remained</p>
<p>pre-pubertal for longer.</p>
<p>Again, whether or not this happens in humans, unclear.</p>
<p>Well, what can we be sure about when we think about puberty?</p>
<p>Puberty is triggered by a number of different factors.</p>
<p>There are changes in GABA expression in the brain</p>
<p>and inhibitory transmitter.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting molecules</p>
<p>that triggers puberty in all individuals</p>
<p>is something called Kispeptin,</p>
<p>K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, Kispeptin.</p>
<p>Kispeptin is made by the brain</p>
<p>and it stimulates large amounts of a different hormone</p>
<p>called GNRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, to be released.</p>
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone</p>
<p>then causes the release of another hormone,</p>
<p>something called luteinizing hormone or LH,</p>
<p>which travels in the bloodstream</p>
<p>and stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen</p>
<p>and the testes of males to produce testosterone.</p>
<p>Kispeptin has other effects as well,</p>
<p>but those are some of the main ones</p>
<p>as they relate to puberty.</p>
<p>Now, this is interesting because at this point,</p>
<p>the testes in males start churning out tons of testosterone</p>
<p>in order to trigger the development</p>
<p>of secondary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>body hair and all the others, deepening of voice, et cetera.</p>
<p>And in females, estrogen is doing various other things,</p>
<p>breast development, et cetera.</p>
<p>Normally in an adult, somebody who has passed puberty,</p>
<p>a big increase in gonadotropin-releasing hormone</p>
<p>and luteinizing hormone would eventually be shut down</p>
<p>because the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>the hypothalamus and the pituitary</p>
<p>are actually measuring how much hormone is in the blood.</p>
<p>And if testosterone or estrogen</p>
<p>or any other hormone goes too high,</p>
<p>they shut down the release of things</p>
<p>like luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way, it&rsquo;s called a negative feedback loop.</p>
<p>It basically is like a thermostat in the house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more complicated than that,</p>
<p>but once levels get too high in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>it shuts down.</p>
<p>But kispeptin is able to drive very high levels</p>
<p>of these hormones in an ongoing way</p>
<p>so that puberty can commence and can continue.</p>
<p>And incidentally, kispeptin has now become yet another</p>
<p>of the panoply of hormones and peptides</p>
<p>and cocktails that athletes take</p>
<p>in order to try and stimulate natural hormone production,</p>
<p>essentially to create their own performance-enhancing drugs</p>
<p>endogenously.</p>
<p>No judgment there, but that&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of kispeptin use.</p>
<p>People, I&rsquo;m truly not suggesting anyone do this,</p>
<p>but people are buying and injecting kispeptin</p>
<p>for the specific reason that even past puberty</p>
<p>can stimulate the large increases in things like estrogen,</p>
<p>large increases in testosterone</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Has a number of psychological effects too.</p>
<p>Seems to have big effects on libido, et cetera.</p>
<p>All these things, of course, are subject to feedback loops</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t work indefinitely.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to highlight, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting anyone do it,</p>
<p>but I do like to pay attention to what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And kispeptin, because it wasn&rsquo;t discovered that long ago,</p>
<p>is one of the things that you don&rsquo;t often hear about</p>
<p>when people talk about performance-enhancing drugs</p>
<p>or therapeutic endocrinology.</p>
<p>These things also have therapeutic uses</p>
<p>in the endocrine setting.</p>
<p>So for instance, kids that don&rsquo;t undergo puberty</p>
<p>or kids that are hypogonadal</p>
<p>or adults that are hypogonadal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not making enough hormone,</p>
<p>will take things like kispeptin among other things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how puberty happens at the biological level,</p>
<p>gets triggered by leptin and kispeptin.</p>
<p>And then this young child</p>
<p>is now a different creature to some extent.</p>
<p>Not just because they&rsquo;re reproductively competent,</p>
<p>of course, but because there&rsquo;s a shift</p>
<p>in a number of the things that underlie these social bonds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a market shift in a number of the things</p>
<p>that allow children and adults</p>
<p>to engage in predictive behavior about each other.</p>
<p>And the whole nature of adolescence and puberty</p>
<p>is to take a child that was a generalist</p>
<p>and to make them a specialist.</p>
<p>And this is very important</p>
<p>as it relates to the conversation about emotionality.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important in terms of all aspects</p>
<p>of brain function and in terms of learning</p>
<p>and in terms of who each and every one of us</p>
<p>will and has become.</p>
<p>In adolescence and in childhood,</p>
<p>sure, there are some genetic biases,</p>
<p>hair color, eye color, height, and things like that.</p>
<p>A lot of that&rsquo;s programmed into the genome.</p>
<p>There are other genetic biases too, of course,</p>
<p>that we inherit.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in adolescence and puberty</p>
<p>that we go from essentially being somewhat good</p>
<p>at a bunch of things or somewhat poor at a bunch of things</p>
<p>to becoming very good at a few things</p>
<p>and very poor at a lot of other things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the relationship</p>
<p>to puberty and neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>This ability to change the brain</p>
<p>in response to experience is starting to taper off</p>
<p>such that by our early 20s, it&rsquo;s harder to achieve.</p>
<p>The transition from generalist to specialist</p>
<p>is one aspect of adolescence and puberty,</p>
<p>but the other is the formation</p>
<p>of social and emotional bonds.</p>
<p>And most of what consumes the minds</p>
<p>and waking hours of adolescents</p>
<p>and children who&rsquo;ve gone through puberty</p>
<p>and going through puberty is questions</p>
<p>about how they relate to social structures,</p>
<p>who they can rely on,</p>
<p>and how they can make reliable predictions in the world</p>
<p>now that they have more agency,</p>
<p>that they are physically changed.</p>
<p>In fact, you could argue that puberty</p>
<p>is the fastest rate of maturation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll go through at any point in your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the largest change that you&rsquo;ll go through</p>
<p>at any point in your life in terms of who you are,</p>
<p>because your biology has fundamentally changed</p>
<p>at the level of your brain and your bodily organs,</p>
<p>all your organs from the skin inward.</p>
<p>So I want to visit a little bit of the research</p>
<p>about some of the core needs</p>
<p>that occur during puberty and adolescence,</p>
<p>not just for parents or for the people</p>
<p>that might be in puberty and adolescence,</p>
<p>but also so that people can reflect</p>
<p>on which of these sort of boxes were checked off for them</p>
<p>as they approached emotional maturity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a terrific review article</p>
<p>that was published in the journal Nature,</p>
<p>which is, if not the premier,</p>
<p>then certainly among the top three premier journals</p>
<p>in the field of science</p>
<p>about the biology of adolescence and puberty,</p>
<p>as well as some of the core needs and demands</p>
<p>that have to be met for successful emotional maturation</p>
<p>during that time.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to that,</p>
<p>but I just want to highlight a few of the things</p>
<p>that they place in the final table.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go through all the results right now,</p>
<p>because you could do that on your own if you like.</p>
<p>They mainly highlight a lot of the changes in neurons</p>
<p>and neural circuits.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;ll just highlight one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a connection between the dopamine centers</p>
<p>in the brain and an area of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in emotion and dispersal.</p>
<p>Dispersal is very interesting.</p>
<p>What you observe in animals and humans</p>
<p>is that around the end of adolescence</p>
<p>and during the transition to puberty,</p>
<p>both because of changes in the brain</p>
<p>and changes in hormones,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an intense desire on the part of the child</p>
<p>to get further and further away from primary caregivers.</p>
<p>Not permanently, they always return,</p>
<p>similar to a child that walks off and then looks back</p>
<p>and sees if everything&rsquo;s safe and then continues on.</p>
<p>During adolescence and puberty,</p>
<p>both in animals and in kids,</p>
<p>it almost seems like there&rsquo;s a bias for action,</p>
<p>and the action is always in a direction away</p>
<p>from the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>As soon as I say that, I can just imagine in my mind</p>
<p>that somebody out there saying,</p>
<p>well, no, my kid, as soon as they hit puberty,</p>
<p>they just want to stay home with us all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not typical.</p>
<p>It happens, but it&rsquo;s not typical.</p>
<p>Mostly there&rsquo;s a desire to start spending more time</p>
<p>with friends, more time with peers, and less time with adults.</p>
<p>And I find it extremely interesting to note</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not just true in humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true in other primate species.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true in rodents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true in almost every other mammalian species.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about these hormones</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t just allow sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just change the brain and bodily organs</p>
<p>and the shape of us.</p>
<p>They also bias us towards dispersal,</p>
<p>getting further and further away</p>
<p>from primary caregivers in particular.</p>
<p>So parents of teenagers or future teenagers,</p>
<p>it is not just normal.</p>
<p>It is baked in to the biology of humans</p>
<p>to disperse around adolescence and in the teen years.</p>
<p>So again, I just want to highlight a few of these,</p>
<p>what were listed as intervention strategies</p>
<p>to promote healthy adolescence and puberty.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very interesting because the entire article,</p>
<p>I should mention who wrote this article, apologies.</p>
<p>One of them is a friend of mine.</p>
<p>So the first author is Ronald Dahl,</p>
<p>not the children&rsquo;s book author, I&rsquo;m assuming.</p>
<p>No, from the School of Public Health</p>
<p>at University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>And Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbrecht,</p>
<p>and Anna Ballenhoff-Suleiman,</p>
<p>forgive me for the pronunciation of the last one.</p>
<p>I know Dr. Wilbrecht quite well.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s done the work on dispersal,</p>
<p>is quite well known for that work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very extensive review,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;ll find it accessible.</p>
<p>A lot of changes in thickness of the brain</p>
<p>at different stages, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I think most people will be interested</p>
<p>in what that translates to in the real world.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is during puberty,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s increased connection, connectivity as we call it,</p>
<p>between the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is involved in motivation and decision-making,</p>
<p>being able to suppress action</p>
<p>for making long-term goals possible,</p>
<p>as well as dopamine centers and the amygdala.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this really broad integration and testing.</p>
<p>I think this is the key element here,</p>
<p>testing of circuits for emotions and reward</p>
<p>as they relate to decisions.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>because when you look at the behavior</p>
<p>of adolescents and teens,</p>
<p>they are testing social interactions.</p>
<p>They are testing physical interactions with the world.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they&rsquo;re engaging in unsafe behavior</p>
<p>and I would never try and justify that</p>
<p>with the underlying neurology.</p>
<p>But the neuroscience points to increased connectivity</p>
<p>between areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are related to emotionality</p>
<p>and to threat detection like the amygdala, but also reward.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a time of testing behaviorally</p>
<p>how different behaviors lead to success or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how different behaviors lead to fear states or not.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you could say that</p>
<p>of any stage of development,</p>
<p>but it seems like puberty is a very, very heightened stage</p>
<p>in which testing of contingencies,</p>
<p>good or bad, is taking place.</p>
<p>And of course, this is happening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s operating in a body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now more capable than the infant.</p>
<p>So an infant can damage themselves through error,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s harder for them to damage themselves</p>
<p>through deliberate planning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important, of course,</p>
<p>to lock up all the medications in the house,</p>
<p>make sure infants can&rsquo;t get to them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not likely that the infant</p>
<p>is going to devise an extremely diabolical plan</p>
<p>to get into the cabinet to get a certain substance,</p>
<p>whereas a teenager might, right?</p>
<p>So you can start to map the neurology</p>
<p>onto some of this emotional exploration.</p>
<p>I do realize that this episode is about emotions.</p>
<p>Puberty is a time in which the internal state</p>
<p>of the person or the animal is being sampled</p>
<p>and tested against different extra receptive events,</p>
<p>only now they are able to guide those events</p>
<p>with more agency, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer just about whether or not the caregiver</p>
<p>is bringing you milk or bringing you food.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the parents will all say,</p>
<p>yeah, but I&rsquo;m paying for everything that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m paying for the car and I&rsquo;m paying for the food.</p>
<p>Ah, true, but the biology doesn&rsquo;t care about the source.</p>
<p>The child or the adolescent is now able,</p>
<p>the teen really, is able to now sample many,</p>
<p>many more extra receptive events through behavior.</p>
<p>So some of these recommendations are interesting.</p>
<p>The theory is that one of the motivations</p>
<p>is to learn to mitigate the risk of famine and malnutrition.</p>
<p>As teenagers get older, they start questioning</p>
<p>whether or not their parents</p>
<p>are everything they thought they were,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re the greatest thing that ever was</p>
<p>or the worst thing that ever was, perhaps,</p>
<p>including whether or not they will be able</p>
<p>to provide them resources.</p>
<p>So they test whether or not</p>
<p>they can actually feed themselves,</p>
<p>whether or not they can support themselves.</p>
<p>Although rarely, certainly it happens,</p>
<p>but rarely are they really taking care of themselves,</p>
<p>although some teens are forced</p>
<p>to take care of themselves, of course.</p>
<p>And other caretakers aren&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>The recommendations that map to the biology include later,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a big push for later start times in schools</p>
<p>to match their shifts in circadian rhythms</p>
<p>and the need for extended sleep,</p>
<p>something we talked about during the sleep episodes,</p>
<p>to insist on sleep interventions for youth</p>
<p>who are at increased risk for mental health problems.</p>
<p>Almost every mental health issue is supported</p>
<p>by getting regular quality sleep of sufficient duration.</p>
<p>Sufficient duration is going to vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Leveraging different kinds of social relationships</p>
<p>that reinforce positive behavior.</p>
<p>This is starting to sound like kind of a boiler plate stuff.</p>
<p>And yet really the goal is during puberty</p>
<p>to encourage as many safe forms of interaction</p>
<p>that allow children, teens really, and adolescents,</p>
<p>I keep calling them children,</p>
<p>but what I mean are people, children going through puberty,</p>
<p>that allow them to test this thing of autonomy</p>
<p>so that they can start to make good assessments</p>
<p>about their extra receptive events that they are selecting</p>
<p>and how those make them feel internally.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re essentially doing a buffet.</p>
<p>The buffet has now broadened to not just include the events</p>
<p>and experiences that their parents</p>
<p>and other caretakers bring them,</p>
<p>but they can now expand the buffet</p>
<p>into things that they can provide themselves.</p>
<p>And so adolescence and puberty is really seen</p>
<p>as the period of development in which one self-samples</p>
<p>for these two elements that we talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning, which are how do I form bonds</p>
<p>and how do I make predictions</p>
<p>about what will make me feel good</p>
<p>at a level of interoception?</p>
<p>Some of that might sound a little transactional,</p>
<p>you know, that all we&rsquo;re trying to do is figure out</p>
<p>how we can bond with people so we can get what we need,</p>
<p>so we can feel how we need.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true to some extent.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a richer,</p>
<p>more abstract aspect to relationships too,</p>
<p>which are, you know, in relationships,</p>
<p>you can access things you couldn&rsquo;t do before,</p>
<p>you can cooperate, there&rsquo;s things like teamwork,</p>
<p>you can do all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But in terms of the biology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s this stage of development</p>
<p>where more autonomy, more physical capability</p>
<p>is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain</p>
<p>and these peptide changes in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And that nonetheless brings us back to the exact same model</p>
<p>that we started with in infancy of alert or calm,</p>
<p>feel good or feel bad.</p>
<p>Primarily exterocepting, primarily interocepting.</p>
<p>So I keep going back to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of like a repeating record on that</p>
<p>because the same core algorithm,</p>
<p>the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a useful framework in my opinion,</p>
<p>because it allows you to sort through all the data</p>
<p>and information that&rsquo;s out there about,</p>
<p>well, this area, the stria terminalis is active</p>
<p>or the basal lateral amygdala is active</p>
<p>or gray matter thickening or this hormone or that hormone</p>
<p>and return to a kind of kernel</p>
<p>of certainly not exhaustive truth,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t cover all aspects of emotionality,</p>
<p>but at least establishes some groundwork</p>
<p>from which you can start to evaluate</p>
<p>how different behaviors might or might not make sense,</p>
<p>how certain emotional responses</p>
<p>might or might not make sense,</p>
<p>regardless of the age of the person or the organism.</p>
<p>A discussion about emotions would not be complete</p>
<p>without talking about the right brain, left brain stuff.</p>
<p>And this is a very interesting aspect of sociology,</p>
<p>psychology and neuroscience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a theory of emotional development</p>
<p>that I find particularly interesting,</p>
<p>which is from Alan Shore at UCLA,</p>
<p>that talks about how most of our testing of bonds</p>
<p>and relationships is this seesawing back and forth</p>
<p>between very dopaminergic, so driven by dopamine</p>
<p>or serotonergic driven by serotonin states.</p>
<p>And this starts with infant and mother or infant and father.</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about this in the previous episode,</p>
<p>but just to remind you,</p>
<p>or for anyone that didn&rsquo;t hear about it,</p>
<p>that during development,</p>
<p>healthy emotional development clearly begins</p>
<p>with an ability for the caretaker and child</p>
<p>to be in calm, peaceful, soothing, touch oriented,</p>
<p>eye gazing type of behaviors.</p>
<p>Those really drive serotonin,</p>
<p>the endogenous opioid system, oxytocin,</p>
<p>things that are very calming</p>
<p>and are centered around pleasure with the here and now,</p>
<p>as well as excited states of what we&rsquo;re going to do next.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a kind of characteristic sign</p>
<p>of the dopaminergic interaction,</p>
<p>where both caretaker and child are wide-eyed,</p>
<p>the pupils dilate, that&rsquo;s a signature of arousal.</p>
<p>They get really excited.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the baby will look away if it gets really excited.</p>
<p>Those are signatures of dopamine release in the body.</p>
<p>And in adolescence, these same things carry forward,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re good bonds are achieved</p>
<p>through hanging around, watching TV,</p>
<p>just kind of playing video games</p>
<p>or texting together or talking,</p>
<p>whatever it is that the soothing local activity</p>
<p>happens to be, as well as adventure</p>
<p>and things that are exciting.</p>
<p>So it could be sports, it could be shopping,</p>
<p>it could be a summer adventure,</p>
<p>it could be the next big thing.</p>
<p>And so this kind of seesawing back and forth</p>
<p>between their different reward systems</p>
<p>seems to be the basis</p>
<p>from which healthy emotional bonds are created.</p>
<p>And I invite anyone who&rsquo;s interested in this</p>
<p>to look up some of Dr. Schor&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>I think I misspoke on the last episode.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst,</p>
<p>but has deep rootings in neuroscience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I think, a fascinating aspect.</p>
<p>But the way it&rsquo;s framed in that book and in his book</p>
<p>and in some of the language around that</p>
<p>is around right brain, left brain.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve all heard this stuff before</p>
<p>that the right brain is thought to be the emotional side.</p>
<p>This is the characteristic thing that you hear out there,</p>
<p>that the right brain is holistic, that it&rsquo;s emotive,</p>
<p>and that the left brain is logical, sequential,</p>
<p>and analytic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what Schor was proposing.</p>
<p>There are some right brain, left brain differences,</p>
<p>but the idea that the right brain is synthetic,</p>
<p>holistic, and emotive,</p>
<p>and that the left brain is logical, sequential,</p>
<p>and analytic is false.</p>
<p>There is zero neuroscience evidence for that whatsoever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to address this in more detail</p>
<p>during a month talking about learning</p>
<p>and memory and dementia,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about some truths,</p>
<p>some differences between the left brain and right brain,</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t have a discussion about emotion</p>
<p>without doing that.</p>
<p>The left brain, at least for people who are right-handed,</p>
<p>is linguistically dominant,</p>
<p>meaning most of language is centered</p>
<p>in the left side of the brain for right-handed people.</p>
<p>If you were a left-hander</p>
<p>and you were forced to become right-handed,</p>
<p>chances are this is still true</p>
<p>because of when language gets laid down in the brain.</p>
<p>For left-handers,</p>
<p>people that naturally write with their left hand</p>
<p>and always did,</p>
<p>language is still mostly in the left side of the brain,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also found more often</p>
<p>in the right side of the brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as lateralized as we say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of distributed between both.</p>
<p>Okay, so right-handers,</p>
<p>most of your language is coming</p>
<p>from the left side of your brain.</p>
<p>Left-handers, it&rsquo;s probably a little bit</p>
<p>more evenly distributed.</p>
<p>And there are some variations,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re a hook righty or a hook lefty,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of nuance to this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the general aspect.</p>
<p>So language tends to be centered</p>
<p>in the left side of the brain.</p>
<p>And that includes lexicon, grammar, syntax, all of it,</p>
<p>except for one.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about one aspect of language</p>
<p>that seems to be more right brain that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>There does seem to be some arithmetic advantage.</p>
<p>So ability in math in the left side of the brain.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>how all this was discovered in a minute.</p>
<p>The right brain, however, is linguistically primitive.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t realize this</p>
<p>because the right brain is always described</p>
<p>as the emotive side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super emotional and holistic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually linguistically primitive.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a way that that&rsquo;s been teased out</p>
<p>through experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good at manipulating spatial things</p>
<p>and visual spatial tasks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily handling that stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of non-language except one aspect.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t a ton of evidence for this,</p>
<p>but the evidence is strong, which is prosody.</p>
<p>Prosody is the lilting and falling of language.</p>
<p>So a good example would be Italian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak Italian.</p>
<p>I only know a little bit of Italian,</p>
<p>but most of the Italian I know</p>
<p>is when my Italian colleagues have said to me,</p>
<p>ma cosa dici?</p>
<p>Which means like, what are you trying to say?</p>
<p>Or what are you saying?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m getting that right.</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re saying I don&rsquo;t speak Italian,</p>
<p>which is true.</p>
<p>Or because one of them knows and loves Costello very much,</p>
<p>they always say, un pigrone, which means big lazy guy,</p>
<p>which accurately captures Costello.</p>
<p>So even those few examples, right?</p>
<p>Ma cosa dici?</p>
<p>Un pigrone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of lilt and fall in Italian.</p>
<p>Other languages, not so much.</p>
<p>And it varies by language.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I find Italian so beautiful,</p>
<p>not the Italian I speak,</p>
<p>but the Italian that other people speak.</p>
<p>So beautiful to listen to is that prosody</p>
<p>and the shifts in intonation are really quite remarkable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a sing song listening to them speak.</p>
<p>And I used to like to go to scientific meetings</p>
<p>and I always hang out with the Italians</p>
<p>because I had some good friends in Italian labs,</p>
<p>but also because they always knew where the best food was.</p>
<p>Their standards for food are incredible.</p>
<p>They would rather starve than eat terrible pasta.</p>
<p>And the pasta they do find</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re willing to eat is always fantastic.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, they always brought a guitar.</p>
<p>They were a lot more fun than a lot of my other colleagues</p>
<p>to hang out with at meetings.</p>
<p>So in any event, the right brain is doing things</p>
<p>that are more about manipulating spatial information.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about this more in a future episode,</p>
<p>but this was discovered in split brain patients,</p>
<p>so people that lack connection</p>
<p>between the two sides of the brain.</p>
<p>And this had to be teased out</p>
<p>through very complicated experiments.</p>
<p>People like Roger Sperry, who won a Nobel prize for this,</p>
<p>who was at Caltech, Mike Gazzaniga and others</p>
<p>figured out these lateralized differences.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just try and demolish the myth</p>
<p>that the right side is synthetic and holistic and emotive,</p>
<p>and that the left side is logical, sequential and analytic,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a left brain person or a right brain person.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no scientific evidence to support that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few lesion studies</p>
<p>that can tease out effects</p>
<p>that make you think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but the really careful work</p>
<p>points in a totally different direction.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have a complete conversation</p>
<p>about emotions and bonds and social connection</p>
<p>without talking about oxytocin.</p>
<p>Oxytocin has come to such prominence</p>
<p>in the last decade or so, and seems to be everywhere.</p>
<p>Anytime you hear a discussion</p>
<p>about neuroscience in the brain or hormones in the brain,</p>
<p>oxytocin is released in response to lactation in females.</p>
<p>It is released in response to sexual interactions.</p>
<p>It is released in response to non-sexual touch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released in males and females.</p>
<p>And indeed, it&rsquo;s involved in pair bonding</p>
<p>and the establishment of social bonds in general.</p>
<p>How it does that seems to be by matching internal state.</p>
<p>It seems to both increase synchrony</p>
<p>of internal states somehow.</p>
<p>Maybe it sets a level of calmness or alertness.</p>
<p>That seems like a reasonable hypothesis.</p>
<p>As well as raising people&rsquo;s awareness</p>
<p>for the emotional state of their partner.</p>
<p>And again, this brings us back</p>
<p>to this alertness calmness axis</p>
<p>and this interoceptive exteroceptive axis.</p>
<p>In order to form good bonds,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t just be thinking about how we feel.</p>
<p>We also need to be paying attention to how others feel</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re evaluating a match.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to see whether or not</p>
<p>there seems to be some sort of synchrony between states.</p>
<p>And oxytocin both seems to increase that synchrony</p>
<p>and increase the awareness</p>
<p>for the emotional state of others.</p>
<p>Now, I know many of you are probably screaming</p>
<p>mirror neurons, mirror neurons.</p>
<p>Mirror neurons, as some of you may know,</p>
<p>and some of you perhaps may not,</p>
<p>are neurons that were discovered in animals and humans</p>
<p>for their ability to respond</p>
<p>when people engaged in certain physical actions</p>
<p>like lifting of a pen,</p>
<p>but the same neurons would respond</p>
<p>when somebody watched someone else lift a pen.</p>
<p>So they were really mirrors of</p>
<p>or representing mirrors of behavior,</p>
<p>both in self and in others.</p>
<p>Mirror neurons are very controversial.</p>
<p>There are many neuroscientists who I respect a lot</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t think they exist</p>
<p>because they look at the data</p>
<p>and the data, at least in their mind,</p>
<p>were over-interpreted in the realm of empathy</p>
<p>and in assigning value to the emotional states of others.</p>
<p>And when I look at the literature,</p>
<p>my opinion is that indeed there are neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that clearly represent the actions of others,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not clear that they&rsquo;re wired into the emotion</p>
<p>and empathy system in any direct way.</p>
<p>And I think the growing consensus is that mirror neurons,</p>
<p>while the name is terrific,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so catchy and encompasses so much</p>
<p>of what you would love for it to encompass,</p>
<p>but that the data don&rsquo;t really support that.</p>
<p>But this is controversial,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m perfectly happy to get experts on here</p>
<p>that could debate it better than I could.</p>
<p>There are, however, neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that were discovered by my colleague,</p>
<p>Karen Harush at Stanford</p>
<p>when she was working in Noam Ziv&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>that clearly point to the fact that primate species</p>
<p>are making assumptions and are trying to predict</p>
<p>the behavior of other members of their species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an experiment I don&rsquo;t have time to go into</p>
<p>in real detail.</p>
<p>We should probably just get Karen on here.</p>
<p>For those of you that are familiar</p>
<p>with the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma,</p>
<p>which is really a model of cooperation,</p>
<p>you can either cooperate,</p>
<p>or one member of a given interaction</p>
<p>can cooperate and the other one won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>or you can both not cooperate.</p>
<p>There are ways in which you can solve</p>
<p>this so-called prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</p>
<p>by looking at previous behavior</p>
<p>and making predictions about the likely next behavior</p>
<p>that the other individual will engage in.</p>
<p>And there do seem to be neurons</p>
<p>that are doing these sorts of predictions or computations.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll go into this in more detail in the future.</p>
<p>So rather than think about mirror neurons,</p>
<p>like neurons for empathy,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more correct to think about neurons</p>
<p>that are trying to predict the behavior of others.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, as we said,</p>
<p>one of the core features of emotions,</p>
<p>which are to establish bonds,</p>
<p>and through those bonds to be able to predict behavior.</p>
<p>So oxytocin is one component of this ability</p>
<p>to predict others&rsquo; behavior and to guide our own behavior.</p>
<p>So here are some experiments</p>
<p>that involve the administration of intranasal oxytocin.</p>
<p>People now, I think you need a prescription,</p>
<p>although in some places you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There are people who are taking intranasal oxytocin</p>
<p>in order to try and increase the depth of bonding.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t recommend you do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried that.</p>
<p>Whatever oxytocin I&rsquo;ve released,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made without an intranasal exogenous application.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s been reported</p>
<p>is increased positive communication among couples.</p>
<p>So people have taken intranasal oxytocin in studies.</p>
<p>So that study, just for those of you who like,</p>
<p>was published in Biological Psychiatry,</p>
<p>which my psychiatry colleagues tell me is a fine journal.</p>
<p>And the title is,</p>
<p>intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication</p>
<p>and reduces the stress hormone cortisol levels</p>
<p>during couple conflict.</p>
<p>They have them fight,</p>
<p>or they have them fight with and without oxytocin.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>Very much in line with the idea</p>
<p>that oxytocin is the quote-unquote trust hormone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of in keeping with that.</p>
<p>That was a 2009 paper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other evidence, for instance,</p>
<p>that men report a greater sense of connection and intimacy</p>
<p>with their partners during sex</p>
<p>after taking intranasal oxytocin.</p>
<p>There are studies in autistic children</p>
<p>giving them intranasal oxytocin</p>
<p>as a way to try and help them</p>
<p>establish better social connection</p>
<p>and quote-unquote empathy or theory of mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about theory of mind before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re understanding of what other children</p>
<p>and adults are experiencing.</p>
<p>So, oxytocin does seem to create these general effects</p>
<p>and how nuanced they are in one situation or another,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware and I was told,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m definitely not recommending this,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray.</p>
<p>Now, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Maybe someone can put in the comments</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;d want to combine oxytocin and ketamine.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine why.</p>
<p>Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s used for the treatment of PTSD.</p>
<p>It used to be used as a recreational drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar to PCP, seems quite dangerous, in fact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why those two things would be combined,</p>
<p>why one would want to combine them,</p>
<p>but there are products out there</p>
<p>that seem to combine those two things,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not certain why one would do that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting to note that it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>A particularly interesting study about oxytocin</p>
<p>is that that was published in the Journal of Neuroscience,</p>
<p>which is a good journal,</p>
<p>that oxytocin modulates social distance</p>
<p>between males and females.</p>
<p>So, this is interesting.</p>
<p>What they did is they gave oxytocin</p>
<p>to people that were in monogamous relationships,</p>
<p>and then they evaluated the extent to which the,</p>
<p>in this case, the males in those relationships</p>
<p>would pay attention to, visual attention,</p>
<p>to attractive other potential partners,</p>
<p>and it seemed like that the general takeaway from the study</p>
<p>is that oxytocin administration</p>
<p>seemed to promote monogamous behavior,</p>
<p>so behavior that was in line with monogamy</p>
<p>of the relationship that they were in,</p>
<p>as opposed to foraging for potentially new mates.</p>
<p>Now, of course, these are somewhat artificial experiments</p>
<p>or very artificial experiments,</p>
<p>depending on how you interpret them,</p>
<p>but the general theme is that oxytocin is promoting monogamy,</p>
<p>monogamy, it&rsquo;s promoting pair bonding,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s promoting a understanding</p>
<p>of the internal state of others,</p>
<p>which requires enhanced exteroception</p>
<p>for those particular others.</p>
<p>So, not just generally having them look everywhere</p>
<p>and see what&rsquo;s going on in the world,</p>
<p>but particularly paying attention</p>
<p>to the emotional states of others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure several of you will be asking,</p>
<p>well, what can I do to increase oxytocin,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your goal?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence, and I invite you again</p>
<p>to go to examine.com or another such site,</p>
<p>like PubMed, if you want to forage PubMed,</p>
<p>that vitamin D is required for proper production,</p>
<p>and in some cases can increase levels of oxytocin</p>
<p>when supplemented, which is interesting,</p>
<p>and that, believe it or not, melatonin,</p>
<p>our old friend melatonin,</p>
<p>which I have pushed back against as a supplement for sleep</p>
<p>because of some of the, what I view</p>
<p>as untoward side effects of melatonin in most cases,</p>
<p>but it seems like melatonin in some cases</p>
<p>can prime the system</p>
<p>for slightly increased oxytocin release.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even one report,</p>
<p>although it didn&rsquo;t look that strong to me,</p>
<p>that low doses of caffeine could increase oxytocin release,</p>
<p>but that, to me, falls under the category</p>
<p>of what was once described as a drug,</p>
<p>when injected into a person or animal,</p>
<p>is always effective at producing a scientific paper,</p>
<p>meaning that you can get a result,</p>
<p>but the result isn&rsquo;t always so robust,</p>
<p>so you always want to read past the titles and the abstracts</p>
<p>and get into the meat of the paper,</p>
<p>and when I did that, the effects were pretty negligible</p>
<p>with caffeine on oxytocin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting that vitamin D and melatonin</p>
<p>may have some positive effects on oxytocin release,</p>
<p>but like I said, many people are just taking oxytocin</p>
<p>directly through these intranasal sprays.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s prescription in most places,</p>
<p>but check, and again, I&rsquo;m not recommending anybody do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I will.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to stick with the oxytocin</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>The other molecule that we make that&rsquo;s extremely important</p>
<p>for social bonds and emotionality</p>
<p>is one that we&rsquo;re going to talk about more</p>
<p>in the month on hormones, and that&rsquo;s vasopressin.</p>
<p>Vasopressin suppresses urination.</p>
<p>It was actually developed, it&rsquo;s made by the body,</p>
<p>but it was developed as a treatment</p>
<p>for something called diabetes insipidus,</p>
<p>where people urinate excessively</p>
<p>and they actually risk dehydration</p>
<p>and they can lose a lot of electrolytes, et cetera,</p>
<p>so it causes water retention.</p>
<p>Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin,</p>
<p>so large amounts of alcohol</p>
<p>make people excrete a lot of fluid and so forth.</p>
<p>Vasopressin has effects on the brain directly.</p>
<p>It actually creates feelings of giddy love.</p>
<p>It also increases memory in very potent ways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole biohacking community</p>
<p>that has been dabbling with vasopressin for some time.</p>
<p>I have never tried it.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>It is prescription and it is a pretty serious compound</p>
<p>to start messing with</p>
<p>because it has so many different effects in the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because it creates the sense of giddy love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also used somewhat as an aphrodisiac,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s similar to oxytocin.</p>
<p>It also has very interesting effects</p>
<p>on monogamous or non-monogamous behavior.</p>
<p>This, again, we will revisit in the future,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a beautiful set of experiments</p>
<p>that have been done in a little rodent species</p>
<p>called a prairie vole.</p>
<p>It turns out there are two different populations</p>
<p>of prairie voles.</p>
<p>Some are monogamous.</p>
<p>They always mate with the same other prairie vole,</p>
<p>and some are very robustly non-monogamous.</p>
<p>They mate with as many other prairie voles as they can.</p>
<p>And it turns out that levels of vasopressin</p>
<p>and or vasopressin receptor</p>
<p>dictate whether or not they&rsquo;re monogamous or not.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually some interesting evidence in humans</p>
<p>when people report their behavior,</p>
<p>assuming they&rsquo;re reporting it accurately,</p>
<p>that vasopressin and vasopressin levels</p>
<p>can relate to monogamy or non-monogamy in humans as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about this in the month on hormones.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about the neuroscience of emotions,</p>
<p>we have to talk about the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s these connections between the body and the viscera,</p>
<p>including the gut, the heart, the lungs,</p>
<p>and the immune system, and the brain,</p>
<p>and that the brain is also controlling these organs</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a two-way street.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this big myth out there that I mentioned before</p>
<p>that stimulating the vagus in various ways</p>
<p>leads to calmness, that it&rsquo;s always going to calm you down.</p>
<p>And that is false.</p>
<p>I just want to repeat, that is completely false.</p>
<p>In fact, there was just a paper,</p>
<p>yet another paper published the other day,</p>
<p>which is fantastic, which is from David McCormick&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>up at the University of Oregon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s published in Current Biology, excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing, I&rsquo;m just reading the title,</p>
<p>vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical,</p>
<p>the neocortex, and behavioral activation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the paper, it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>It illustrates yet again,</p>
<p>stimulation of the vagus increases dopamine release,</p>
<p>increases activation of the brain alertness.</p>
<p>It is a stimulant of alertness.</p>
<p>It is not calming people down.</p>
<p>Now, this is interesting in light of emotionality</p>
<p>because of work that&rsquo;s been done</p>
<p>by many groups, but in particular,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to focus on the work of a colleague of mine,</p>
<p>Karl Deisseroth at Stanford, who&rsquo;s a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>but has also developed a lot of tools</p>
<p>to adjust the activity of neurons in real time</p>
<p>using light and electrical stimulation and so forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer you to an article in the New Yorker</p>
<p>that was published about this a few years ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read a brief excerpt,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll put the link in the caption as well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking to an extremely depressed,</p>
<p>suicidally depressed patient</p>
<p>who has a small device implanted</p>
<p>that allows her to adjust her vagus nerve activity.</p>
<p>Now, vagus stimulation was originally developed</p>
<p>for the treatment of epilepsy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now being used for various other purposes.</p>
<p>Vagus stimulation can even increase plasticity, it seems.</p>
<p>So again, increasing activity of the vagus</p>
<p>increases alertness, and it&rsquo;s just incredible</p>
<p>to see what happens in real time to emotionality</p>
<p>when the vagus is stimulated.</p>
<p>Again, not calming, but activating alertness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in his office and they&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>and he asks her how she&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>and she describes how she&rsquo;s been doing previously</p>
<p>as quote-unquote going pancake,</p>
<p>which for her just means totally laid out flat,</p>
<p>not much going on.</p>
<p>She talks about how she doesn&rsquo;t want to pursue a job.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s really depressed.</p>
<p>And he says in typical good psychiatrist fashion,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a lot to think about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the quote.</p>
<p>And they talk about her blood pressure, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then she says, mood&rsquo;s been down, just spiraling down,</p>
<p>talks about insomnia, bad dreams, low appetite.</p>
<p>So this is severe depression.</p>
<p>This is what we call major depression.</p>
<p>And then she requests,</p>
<p>can we please go up to 1.5 on vagus stimulation?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d been receiving 1.2 milliamps of stimulation</p>
<p>every five minutes to 30 seconds,</p>
<p>but was no longer able to feel the effects.</p>
<p>So he says, okay, I think we can go up a little.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re tolerating things well.</p>
<p>They start the stimulation and quote,</p>
<p>in the course of the next few minutes,</p>
<p>her name was Sally, underwent a remarkable change.</p>
<p>Her frown disappeared.</p>
<p>She became cheerful,</p>
<p>describing the pleasure she had had</p>
<p>during the Christmas holiday</p>
<p>and recounting how she&rsquo;d recently watched</p>
<p>some YouTube videos of Dyseroth.</p>
<p>She was still smiling and talking when the session ended,</p>
<p>and they walked out to the reception area.</p>
<p>So this is just by stimulating and activating the vagus.</p>
<p>Now, why am I bringing this up?</p>
<p>Well, for several reasons.</p>
<p>One is the vagus is fascinating</p>
<p>in terms of the brain-body connection.</p>
<p>Two, I&rsquo;d like to keep trying to dispel the myth</p>
<p>that vagus stimulation is all about being calm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about being alert.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that originally got going backwards,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about being alert.</p>
<p>And once again, level of alertness or level of calmness</p>
<p>is impacting emotion,</p>
<p>that this access of alertness and calmness</p>
<p>is one primary access in emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only one</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s also this valence component of good or bad.</p>
<p>And those two aren&rsquo;t the only ones</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s also this component of interoceptive,</p>
<p>exteroceptive that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>and there will be others too.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not exhaustive.</p>
<p>But I find it fascinating,</p>
<p>and it really brings us back to where we started,</p>
<p>which is what are the core elements of emotion?</p>
<p>And what can you do about them?</p>
<p>And before we close up today,</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;ve mentioned some tools,</p>
<p>I talked about the Mood Meter app,</p>
<p>I talked about oxytocin</p>
<p>and some of the things that impact oxytocin,</p>
<p>I talked about some of the ways</p>
<p>that you can conceptualize emotions.</p>
<p>This business of how you conceptualize emotions</p>
<p>is really the most powerful tool you can ever have</p>
<p>in terms of understanding and regulating</p>
<p>your emotional state.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to try and wrap your head around it,</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s not the simplest thing to do,</p>
<p>but rather than think of emotions as just these labels,</p>
<p>happy, sad, awe, depressed,</p>
<p>thinking about emotions, excuse me,</p>
<p>as elements of the brain and body</p>
<p>that encompass levels of alertness</p>
<p>that include a dynamic with the outside world</p>
<p>and your perception of your internal state,</p>
<p>and starting to really think about emotions</p>
<p>in a structured way</p>
<p>can not only allow you to understand</p>
<p>some of the pathology of when you might feel depressed</p>
<p>or anxious or others are depressed and anxious,</p>
<p>but also to develop a richer</p>
<p>emotional experience to anything.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I don&rsquo;t expect that</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re out there interacting with friends</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching TV and experiencing life</p>
<p>that you should be parsing every bit of your experience</p>
<p>in some sort of reductionist and mechanistic way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the goal here.</p>
<p>But for those of you that are practitioners,</p>
<p>teachers of any kind,</p>
<p>for those of you that are kids,</p>
<p>for those of you that are trying to understand</p>
<p>what your emotional life and your consciousness,</p>
<p>dare I say the word, really consists of,</p>
<p>I do believe that these are fundamental elements</p>
<p>that are well-supported by the science</p>
<p>across a variety of researchers</p>
<p>doing things from a variety of different perspectives,</p>
<p>and some of whom agree with one another</p>
<p>and some of whom don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I offer it to you as a source of knowledge</p>
<p>from which you can start to think about</p>
<p>your emotional life differently, I hope,</p>
<p>as well as others in a way that builds more richness</p>
<p>into that experience, not that detracts from it.</p>
<p>One last point as it relates to that,</p>
<p>many of you have asked me about psychedelic therapies</p>
<p>that are now emerging, things like psilocybin and MDMA.</p>
<p>We are, of course, going to dive into that topic deeply.</p>
<p>We have an expert guest coming on to discuss that topic.</p>
<p>Those compounds clearly affect the aspects of emotionality</p>
<p>that we were talking about today,</p>
<p>calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad,</p>
<p>interoceptive, exteroceptive, positioning.</p>
<p>And so rather than just do a kind of cursory exploration</p>
<p>of those compounds and what the therapeutic</p>
<p>and scientific community is thinking about them</p>
<p>and how they function, I think it&rsquo;s more important</p>
<p>to embed that framework in our thinking</p>
<p>so that when we address psychedelics</p>
<p>and we address other sorts of therapies,</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>different types of emotive therapies</p>
<p>that relate to individuals and couples, et cetera,</p>
<p>that we are able to think about them</p>
<p>with some sort of structure and rigor</p>
<p>rather than just talk about them as a bunch of chemicals</p>
<p>that produce these amazing experiences</p>
<p>that people need to tell you about.</p>
<p>Because if there&rsquo;s one truth,</p>
<p>it seems that psychedelics seem to promote activity</p>
<p>of storytelling about psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>But that itself is not really what</p>
<p>the therapeutic community and the academic</p>
<p>and communities are interested in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interested in trying to understand</p>
<p>the universal truths, the universal biological shifts</p>
<p>and psychological shifts that occur</p>
<p>in the clinical use of those compounds.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to hold off for now,</p>
<p>but we will get to them.</p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;ve covered an enormous amount</p>
<p>of material today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the equivalent of two,</p>
<p>if not three university lectures in one podcast episode.</p>
<p>I want to thank those of you that have supported the podcast</p>
<p>and point to ways in which all of you</p>
<p>can support the podcast.</p>
<p>Many of these are cost-free.</p>
<p>The first is to please subscribe on YouTube</p>
<p>and as well to hit the notifications button</p>
<p>so that when we release new videos,</p>
<p>which typically is every Monday</p>
<p>for the full length episodes,</p>
<p>but we also know how short clips,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be notified.</p>
<p>As well, if you could subscribe on Apple and Spotify</p>
<p>and leave us a review on Apple,</p>
<p>you have the opportunity to leave us a five-star review</p>
<p>if you think we deserve a five-star review.</p>
<p>Please tell your friends and family and coworkers</p>

<p>and informative for them.</p>
<p>And if you want to send them links, that&rsquo;s terrific too.</p>
<p>In addition, if you could check out our sponsors,</p>
<p>we always provide links to those sponsors in the captions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to support the podcast.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your time and attention</p>
<p>and thank you for your interest in science.</p>
