    <p>Hi friends, it&rsquo;s time for Sunday service, and I&rsquo;m gonna start this Sunday service off with a trigger warning</p>
<p>Yeah, I know in my first episode. I said I&rsquo;m not gonna give another one, but I&rsquo;m treading in</p>
<p>shark infested waters today</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m gonna be talking about the mental health field and why all of a sudden everybody seems to have some kind of fucking disorder</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s anxiety or depression or ADD ADHD</p>
<p>Whatever people can come up with they just throw on their self now</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna share my two cents and my realizations I&rsquo;ve had around all this and</p>
<p>share some shit that people are not seeing and</p>
<p>What comes with that is people having to take accountability and see their self and they&rsquo;re not gonna like it</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna piss some people off with this one, but if this fits you Cinderella if the shoe fits</p>
<p>Reflect a little okay get past your little being triggered and fucking reflect and think about it</p>
<p>That was the meanest trigger warning. I could have ever</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just giving you a heads up. I&rsquo;m gonna be talking about some heavy shit</p>
<p>So the first thing I need to get off my chest this dumb bitch came on my tick-tock</p>
<p>I made a couple of days ago and tried to discredit me</p>
<p>Because she said I had no training in the field of psychology and I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck I was talking about</p>
<p>And what I was saying didn&rsquo;t hold weight because I didn&rsquo;t have training or a title and I just want to bring something to people&rsquo;s awareness</p>
<p>Not everybody feels the need to flash their title to feel credible. I know what the fuck I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t need to go and tell everybody. I&rsquo;m a registered nurse</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a whole ass RN bitch. I have training in psychology. I have training with mental health disorders</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken extra courses on it</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m a nurse because I don&rsquo;t feel the need to throw that out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to prove that what I say is valuable because I went to school and got a degree</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter any Joe Schmo can go get a title and go get a degree</p>
<p>It does not make you any more or less credible</p>
<p>I mean it does give you a little more credibility</p>
<p>But a lot of people have titles that are dumbasses like they&rsquo;re dipshits have no clue what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>Like just because someone is a therapist it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re a good one just because someone has a job</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re gonna do it</p>
<p>Anyone can read a book and pass the test</p>
<p>because a lot of the people I went to nursing school with we&rsquo;re goddamn idiots and I&rsquo;m shocked that they passed but</p>
<p>Getting a certification getting a license getting anything like that is all about your ability to read information</p>
<p>Memorize it and then take a test</p>
<p>Any Joe Schmo can do that. You don&rsquo;t have to be fucking special to have a title</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think titles hold weight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t feel the need to go throw my title around if you don&rsquo;t want to listen to what I have to say</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care and</p>
<p>honestly, anyone that&rsquo;s a human being has</p>
<p>Experience with psychology because we&rsquo;re all living it dumbass like oh my god</p>
<p>This girl just got me mad like she tried to discredit me</p>
<p>Because she thought that I was not qualified to talk about what I was talking about little did she fucking know I am</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a therapist</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, but I have training and I have knowledge and experience</p>
<p>with this field</p>
<p>personally and also professionally</p>
<p>That is the worst thing you can ever do when it comes to me is try to make me look stupid</p>
<p>Because I own where I&rsquo;m deficient. I own it if I don&rsquo;t fucking know something and you never know</p>
<p>Everything there is to know about me</p>
<p>Sorry, so now that I just put out the fact that I&rsquo;m a nurse now</p>
<p>You ain&rsquo;t got shit to say bitch</p>
<p>But my whole point in that was don&rsquo;t let someone big-dick you</p>
<p>Because they have a title and you don&rsquo;t there are certain times where a title is important and I get it</p>
<p>but the people that feel the need to flash their title and</p>
<p>Try to discredit others because they don&rsquo;t have a certain title. It&rsquo;s some pussy shit. Okay, that&rsquo;s some insecure</p>
<p>unaware</p>
<p>So asleep you&rsquo;re snoring</p>
<p>behavior</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s move on to the popularity of</p>
<p>Mental health disorders, so there&rsquo;s two standpoints. I&rsquo;m gonna go at this from I&rsquo;m gonna go at it from the standpoint of the medical field</p>
<p>And why diagnosis are being thrown out so easily now</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also gonna go about it on the standpoint of why people want to be diagnosed</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perspective people don&rsquo;t consider but I&rsquo;m gonna do both. Here I go</p>
<p>Okay, so from the medical side of it when people are trained</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually trained to diagnose and treat</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re trying to diagnose you kind of have this underlying tone of like I&rsquo;m trying to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with this person</p>
<p>Because typically you have a list of symptoms and if they fit it then they have this problem and you treat this problem</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at people like they have a fucking problem. You&rsquo;re trying to diagnose if they do or don&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>lot of practitioners think that just diagnosing something and throwing a medication at it is</p>
<p>Useful and they also think that when you look at a list of symptoms and someone fits that list that that&rsquo;s what the person has</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the person is suffering from and then they&rsquo;re gonna try and go about treating that</p>
<p>So a lot of practitioners think it&rsquo;s really cut and dry. I know that there&rsquo;s a lot that are helpful</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that are like a way more aware, but a lot of them are fucking asleep</p>
<p>So they think that if this person fits these symptoms they have this problem now, let&rsquo;s treat this problem</p>
<p>And then they try to treat it</p>
<p>Every single person is different. So one-size-fits-all is like the worst approach you could fucking take</p>
<p>But who has time to do that from the perspective of the therapist or the psychologist?</p>
<p>Who the fuck has time to get to know and get to learn each person individually to be able to properly treat them?</p>
<p>Nobody, it&rsquo;s a rushed fucking system. The healthcare system as a whole is</p>
<p>Absolutely fucked but the mental health side</p>
<p>No one has the time to actually dive into each</p>
<p>Individual patient at the level that it would take to truly figure out what was going on. They throw a medication at you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, okay, you have these symptoms these symptoms relate to a chemical imbalance. Here&rsquo;s the medication</p>
<p>That is the chemical you&rsquo;re missing or the chemical that&rsquo;s gonna balance you out. Hope it works. You&rsquo;re handed a coping mechanism</p>
<p>Medications are coping mechanisms. That&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they are if there is a condition and you are using a medication for it</p>
<p>it is to help deal with certain symptoms a</p>
<p>lot of the staff in this field are</p>
<p>In it to help people like they want to feel like they&rsquo;re helping but like I said, a lot of them are asleep</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not actually trying to help like I don&rsquo;t want to say it&rsquo;s money base</p>
<p>But that is a factor and they like to feel like they&rsquo;re helping but they don&rsquo;t want to put in like a lot of effort</p>
<p>So being able to just throw someone like a quick fix air quote cure or something to manage their symptoms</p>
<p>They think that they&rsquo;ve helped this person</p>
<p>When they actually did it they just masked the problem</p>
<p>I actually was one of the people that went into my doctor and was diagnosed as clinically severely depressed</p>
<p>Everything makes sense looking back</p>
<p>But my point is I walked in and I was given a fucking sheet and I filled out certain symptoms</p>
<p>I checked if I had them or didn&rsquo;t and then they just used the number scale of how I answered the fucking test</p>
<p>Basically diagnosed if I was depressed or not, like it was fucking pathetic and they put me on Zoloft, which is an antidepressant</p>
<p>I never took it, but they prescribed it to me and I was just like</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>The way that they just so quick just threw the fucking medication at me made me laugh and like disgust</p>
<p>I was like what the fuck like y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t even take two seconds to actually ask what I was going through what was going on</p>
<p>Like y&rsquo;all just threw a medication at me. Okay, cool</p>
<p>And I know people are gonna come at me not everybody&rsquo;s experiences like that</p>
<p>I get it</p>
<p>but too many people&rsquo;s are and the prescription of medications and the diagnosis of certain disorders is</p>
<p>Just thrown around like it&rsquo;s no big deal</p>
<p>So something else that definitely needs to be taken into consideration is how complex human beings are</p>
<p>there is so much shit that we don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>Why we are the way we are and why and how we operate the way that we do. There is so much like</p>
<p>Confusion because no one&rsquo;s the same. Like I said trying to figure this shit out. Good luck</p>
<p>There are so many things that science still has no explanation for there&rsquo;s so many things that happen and there&rsquo;s so many elements to</p>
<p>Human beings as a whole that no one can fucking explain</p>
<p>so I will cut the field of psychology some slack because</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things you can&rsquo;t explain</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things that we do not understand and in a world where everybody wants immediate results and immediate relief and to feel better</p>
<p>Fast they kind of have to deal with it</p>
<p>They kind of just have to throw out what shuts people to fuck up because it&rsquo;s an overwhelming amount of people that are like running</p>
<p>for help</p>
<p>But you want to get into marketing a lot of the reason that people are constantly frantically looking for</p>
<p>Cures for the way that they feel is because they&rsquo;re being taught that the way that they feel is wrong. Look at marketing</p>
<p>Marketing is meant to poke a hole in</p>
<p>Everything that you think you should be going on</p>
<p>so by marketing and social media and everything going on in like the new age of like this generation is</p>
<p>Fucking everybody up mentally because we&rsquo;re being told we should feel like this. We shouldn&rsquo;t feel like this</p>
<p>We should have all of these things accomplished by this age</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t something&rsquo;s wrong with you one size fits all does not work. No one fucking knows what&rsquo;s good for anybody</p>
<p>Like you have to figure that out for yourself</p>
<p>Like society as a whole has failed itself</p>
<p>Like I want to say like society has failed me, but I&rsquo;m part of it like society has failed itself</p>
<p>Everyone is just trying to make money and their marketing shit to make everyone feel bad about the way that they feel</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll buy their product little do they know it&rsquo;s just causing so much pain to people like yeah</p>
<p>You made your money, but everyone is fucked up in the head now</p>
<p>Like I feel so bad for the people that have to grow up in this day and age like</p>
<p>Holy shit, dude</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have kids like I&rsquo;ve always wanted to have kids</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m so scared of what the fuck the world is turning into</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t want to bring something into this world and</p>
<p>Bring it into this shit show and then God forbid something happens to me and I fucking die and it&rsquo;s stuck here by itself</p>
<p>oh my god, no, like I would lose my fucking shit and</p>
<p>Science is very behind because in order for something to be scientifically figured out and proven it takes time</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re over here experiencing shit as it&rsquo;s happening and science isn&rsquo;t catching up for years</p>
<p>So all the research and all the cures and all the shit that we think we know is years behind</p>
<p>But besides that nowadays you got access to any information you want. So</p>
<p>When you feel like something&rsquo;s wrong with you if you&rsquo;re experiencing something that you feel is off you can look up shit</p>
<p>You can go online. You can go to doctors like everything is so advanced that</p>
<p>People experience something and then go hunting for a solution and a quick fix</p>
<p>whereas if you didn&rsquo;t go running from yourself and running from what you&rsquo;re feeling and</p>
<p>Experiencing you might be able to find something that will actually work. So</p>
<p>Running away and trying to find all these solutions is taking you away from yourself</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re distracted and you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with you. Wake up, babe. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable</p>
<p>If you would just look at why you are the way that you are and why you do the things that you do</p>
<p>You will see that you had to adapt certain behaviors at a certain point in your life to survive</p>
<p>Whatever you were dealing with you had to learn to be or act a certain way or</p>
<p>Cope in a certain way that helped you when you&rsquo;re no longer in a situation that you had to cope with if you still do</p>
<p>The coping mechanisms that helped you with nothing to cope with it&rsquo;s gonna start to hurt you</p>
<p>So you just got to try to understand yourself and why you do what you do. There&rsquo;s a fucking answer to it</p>
<p>It just lies inside you not outside of you</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re out here hunting for the solution, you&rsquo;re fucking yourself</p>
<p>something people genuinely do not understand is</p>
<p>when you grow up in an</p>
<p>Invalidating household where your emotions are not seen they&rsquo;re discredited</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re invalidated that it will fuck you up. That seems so small, but it is the cause of so many other things</p>
<p>So an example is borderline personality disorder the diagnosis</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to have five out of the nine symptoms. I used to have eight of them and so did my sister</p>
<p>We were never clinically diagnosed</p>
<p>But upon looking at all the behaviors we were exhibiting and all the shit that we thought was wrong with us as soon as we went</p>
<p>Into why are we doing what we&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>How is this how did this come about if you look at a certain behavior you have and you play the tape backwards?</p>
<p>How could someone end up at this place doing this thing or thinking this way?</p>
<p>You will start to see all the things that happened for you to get there</p>
<p>So the invalidating household thing whenever you were feeling a bad emotion if your parent looked at you and was like</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to be upset. Why the fuck are you upset? Boom? You&rsquo;re instantly invalidated. So you&rsquo;re still gonna feel sad or upset</p>
<p>Regardless of what everybody else around you says so when you&rsquo;re little you are dealing with the contradiction</p>
<p>So you feel a certain way your parent tells you no, you shouldn&rsquo;t feel that way or no, you don&rsquo;t feel that way</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re dealing with the way that you feel</p>
<p>Plus now you have to deal with the contradiction that you feel your inside does not match your outside</p>
<p>Your reality is a contradiction</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>most of your time is gonna be focused on dealing with the contradiction and</p>
<p>Trying to get away from that or trying to like figure out a way to cope with feeling like shit and also having to function</p>
<p>This is a very important time for you to be learning how to regulate your emotions</p>
<p>But you are not ever gonna be in the position to learn how to regulate them if you don&rsquo;t even believe them or everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Invalidating them. So with borderline personality disorder, it&rsquo;s basically you lack the skills to</p>
<p>Regulate your emotions and it is understandable. I know that sounds insensitive and it&rsquo;s like a simple quick fix</p>
<p>It is so complex, but at the root cause of it, that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>constant invalidation and gaslighting</p>
<p>That never allowed you to learn how to fully deal with your emotions. You were just dealing with the constant contradiction and</p>
<p>Trying to fight the way that you felt</p>
<p>So when you have these emotions that you feel and I was an adult and you don&rsquo;t know how to fucking deal with them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna exhibit the behaviors of borderline personality disorder. Hello</p>
<p>With anxiety people do not know how to regulate their emotions. I know that there&rsquo;s so much more to it, but hang on</p>
<p>Anxiety is not fucking bad. Every human being feels it it becomes debilitating when you do not know how to control it</p>
<p>By sitting in it and working with it. You will learn to control it</p>
<p>You will never learn how to surf if you don&rsquo;t get in the fucking water</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t go get in the fucking waves, you will never learn how to ride them</p>
<p>So when you have all these emotions come up and this anxiety come up and all these anxious thoughts if you keep running from</p>
<p>Them you will never learn how to surf them</p>
<p>Go get in the fucking water get in those thoughts. It&rsquo;s gonna be uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s gonna hurt like hell</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna freak the fuck out like learn how to control yourself</p>
<p>Learn how to control your emotions as much as you can after you&rsquo;ve done that or if you need help doing that go get it</p>
<p>But trying to get a fucking Xanax just to shut it up. That&rsquo;s not the way to go, babe</p>
<p>Oh and a little fun fact about anxiety</p>
<p>You know how when you wake up in the morning and you&rsquo;re like stressed out or you feel like a little bit of like panic</p>
<p>Your cortisol levels are higher in the morning</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you feel stressed out when you wake up</p>
<p>And some mornings you do sometimes you don&rsquo;t but when you do wake up and you&rsquo;re stressed out</p>
<p>That could be a cause of it. So that&rsquo;s just something for you to know</p>
<p>And no, I will not be talking about eating disorders in this episode because i&rsquo;m gonna make an entire</p>
<p>Podcast episode about eating disorders and then i&rsquo;m gonna make another one after that with my diet tips</p>
<p>And all the shit i&rsquo;ve learned about weight loss and gaining muscle and all that</p>
<p>But eating disorders also kind of apply to everything i&rsquo;m saying in this</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s such a fucking</p>
<p>Big cookie to try and crumble that i&rsquo;m gonna give it its own episode</p>
<p>Oh my god, that was a terrible analogy</p>
<p>I am not making a fat joke talking about crumbling a cookie</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s flip this into the opposite side of you&rsquo;re the patient going in</p>
<p>Okay, like I said the psychiatrist or whoever is going to diagnose you is going to look at you</p>
<p>With the tone of like you have a problem and i&rsquo;m trying to figure out what your problem is</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re walking in and saying I feel</p>
<p>This way this way and this way</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re immediately going to be like, oh no, that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to try and figure out how to fix that</p>
<p>So immediately right off the bat you are being reflected</p>
<p>That there is something wrong with the way that you feel and when you walk into a practitioner&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>They are kind of in the place of authority. So you&rsquo;re going to them you trust them</p>
<p>You trust their judgment and if they&rsquo;re looking at you like this and basically trying to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel like you have something wrong with you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole different taste when someone tries to understand</p>
<p>Why you are the way you are versus trying to figure out all these problems you&rsquo;re having to diagnose you with something</p>
<p>And this whole process kind of demonizes your emotions and makes them bad</p>
<p>Because when you walk in and say i&rsquo;m feeling sad or i&rsquo;m feeling hopeless</p>
<p>The practitioner is going to look at you and be like, oh no, that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out how to not feel that most of the times they&rsquo;ll ask you why?</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Once they hear what you&rsquo;re going through that&rsquo;s made you sad. Okay. Well to help you deal with this</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fucking antidepressant. Here&rsquo;s some xanax for when you start getting anxious. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>All of us feel like we have something wrong with us</p>
<p>We do like it&rsquo;s just the fucking base of it and we all struggle with feeling like we&rsquo;re not good enough</p>
<p>I swear to god. It&rsquo;s all of us. You&rsquo;re not alone in that</p>
<p>But when you walk into this practitioner&rsquo;s office and you are feeling this way</p>
<p>And then they give you a diagnosis</p>
<p>Of you have this problem. This is what&rsquo;s wrong with you. You feel validated. You just got confirmation that the way that you feel</p>
<p>Was right like you felt like something was wrong with you and they just confirmed that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be relieved because you&rsquo;re gonna be like, oh fuck finally. Yeah, it makes sense because i&rsquo;ve been feeling like this</p>
<p>So it feels good to have that diagnosis. You finally have an explanation for the way that you feel</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you think you think that&rsquo;s the explanation for the way that you feel you think the depression or the anxiety</p>
<p>or the adhd is the like cause and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>Is the real reason you feel the way that you do</p>
<p>And then you stop looking you stop looking for the real reason of what is causing it</p>
<p>Which is a very lengthy process</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fucking long and so many people throw the responsibility of figuring it out onto their practitioner whoever&rsquo;s trying to help them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to help you sort shit out</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to be doing the reflective work on your own and going to them when you hit a block or when you need</p>
<p>A new perspective or you need help. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with seeking help</p>
<p>but I think a lot of people throw the totality of their healing and their</p>
<p>reflection onto whoever&rsquo;s working with them, which isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Feasible like they don&rsquo;t have enough time in the fucking day</p>
<p>To learn about you and all of their other clients to the level that you need to to actually get to the bottom of it</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re responsible for the most of it. You&rsquo;re responsible for like the</p>
<p>Heavy part of it, which nobody wants to be everybody would rather just hear a fucking</p>
<p>Diagnosis and run with it. So I get it like it totally makes sense why people do</p>
<p>So now I want to move into why a lot of people claim their disorder</p>
<p>So fucking hard and make it their personality trait because that&rsquo;s very common on social media right now</p>
<p>From what i&rsquo;m seeing and i&rsquo;m not going to be as mean as you would think about this one</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use depression as an example for what i&rsquo;m about to talk about. So let&rsquo;s say someone is going through life</p>
<p>And shit is just really</p>
<p>hard for them</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re constantly disappointed. They try everything that everybody else does but it doesn&rsquo;t work out for them</p>
<p>Like shit just seems to be more difficult</p>
<p>For this person</p>
<p>Than other people like they feel like they&rsquo;re at a disadvantage somehow because shit&rsquo;s just not working</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard and they can&rsquo;t really find an explanation for it. I rhyme a reason like they&rsquo;re just pushed to a point where</p>
<p>They feel like no matter what they do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pointless. It&rsquo;s not going to work. It&rsquo;s not going to help them</p>
<p>If someone is feeling this way</p>
<p>And they are diagnosed</p>
<p>with a condition</p>
<p>That is their savior. So daily life. Everyone&rsquo;s going to expect this person to operate normally</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no indication physically that something&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re expected to perform and you&rsquo;re expected to function and you&rsquo;re held to a certain standard. So this person that is feeling</p>
<p>Like at a huge disadvantage and is so fucking disappointed by everything and shit&rsquo;s just not working for them. They&rsquo;re expected</p>
<p>to still</p>
<p>Perform air quote and like function despite how they&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>So normal life is going to seem more difficult for them because they&rsquo;re battling something that other people can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>And other people don&rsquo;t understand because typically when you try and talk to someone about shit you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be cool with it the first couple times and then they&rsquo;re going to get to the point where they think that you&rsquo;re bitching</p>
<p>And complaining and you&rsquo;re just going to be seen as like a whiny motherfucker</p>
<p>And things are not going to make sense. Like most people are not aware enough</p>
<p>To actually be able to conceptualize of what you&rsquo;re going through when you go to them and say I feel hopeless</p>
<p>So if someone&rsquo;s feeling this way and they&rsquo;re having these experiences and they go and they get diagnosed they&rsquo;re like thank fucking god</p>
<p>like finally</p>
<p>Everything makes sense. I have something wrong with me and then they can tell people. Oh, i&rsquo;m depressed</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m clinically diagnosed as depressed. I&rsquo;m clinically diagnosed as anxious</p>
<p>I have adhd. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t focus on anything</p>
<p>They have something now where they can tell it to people and be cut slack</p>
<p>if someone says</p>
<p>I am clinically depressed</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re immediately</p>
<p>Like no longer held to the expectations of a seemingly normal functioning person</p>
<p>So they get relief</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally understandable. Like why the fuck would you want to function if you&rsquo;re feeling all of these things?</p>
<p>If you feel like no one&rsquo;s cutting you slack I can see where someone would want to go seek out</p>
<p>Something to help them be cut slack</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize that they&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna get into</p>
<p>How these diagnoses like help you avoid responsibility in a minute and i&rsquo;m gonna have to like show some tough love</p>
<p>But just my point with this of like I can understand and see why someone would want to flaunt</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>mental disorder</p>
<p>Because it it makes people see hey something&rsquo;s wrong with me. So like when someone is handicapped</p>
<p>You can physically see that they&rsquo;re missing a limb or they&rsquo;re in a wheelchair or they have some kind of deformity</p>
<p>You know immediately not to hold them to a certain standard, you know immediately like you have to cut them some slack and be more</p>
<p>Understanding so when someone gets a clinical diagnosis and keeps bringing it up, that&rsquo;s them waving their little white flag</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s them letting everybody know. Hey, i&rsquo;m in a wheelchair. I have something working against me</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t expect the same things you&rsquo;d expect out of a normal person</p>
<p>This can also be used as a form of protection</p>
<p>from criticism</p>
<p>Because people are not going to criticize someone with something wrong with them</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re immediately the asshole like if you go make fun of someone for being handicapped</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fucking dick</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s wrong with you honestly what the fuck is wrong with you to unprovoked go make fun of somebody as it is</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>The people that throw out their diagnosis</p>
<p>are less frequently</p>
<p>attacked</p>
<p>And criticized and bullied and shit because it&rsquo;s like an instant way for people to feel bad for you</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t criticize you and this also makes total sense</p>
<p>But I do want to go back to the depression thing really quick</p>
<p>um, if you are having experiences where</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at a place where you feel hopeless</p>
<p>So if shit is going wrong in your life and you keep trying things and they&rsquo;re not working</p>
<p>No shit, you feel hopeless</p>
<p>No fucking shit</p>
<p>Given the experiences you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at a point where you feel hopeless and like why even bother?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that</p>
<p>Like anybody in your position that was dealing with that and what you&rsquo;ve been through would feel the exact same fucking way</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t judge yourself for the way that you feel no matter what it is</p>
<p>Because the way you feel is never wrong because the way that you feel</p>
<p>Is based off of the thoughts that you&rsquo;re thinking and the experiences you&rsquo;re having and the meanings you assign to those experiences</p>
<p>So if you keep having fucked up shit happening to you</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re gonna like just want to give up anyone would</p>
<p>And a lot of people are at the point where they want to</p>
<p>This is so much more common than you think because when you hear of a random suicide</p>
<p>Someone does not just wake up one day and be sad and kill theirself</p>
<p>It is a prolonged and like extended period of time where they&rsquo;re feeling the same way and they&rsquo;ve tried and tried and tried</p>
<p>To stop feeling this they&rsquo;ve tried to fix it. It doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>Like someone it&rsquo;s not just a rash decision to kill yourself. Like that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t fucking get</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re suffering with these certain feelings for so long that one day you just have enough and you off yourself</p>
<p>But my point is so many more people are suffering with hopelessness and feeling</p>
<p>Like just fucking for what than you think?</p>
<p>So many people are on the verge of suicide right now that you have no idea about so you&rsquo;re not alone with the way that you feel</p>
<p>Not at all like so many more people deal with this than you think I deal with it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there multiple times. Everyone would just look at me and think everything&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>But I have been to that brink so many fucking times</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not saying that for like</p>
<p>Anything other than to make you feel seen</p>
<p>Because you would look at me and think there was nothing fucking wrong like that to that extent</p>
<p>But bitch i&rsquo;m right here with you</p>
<p>I just had a fucking three-day meltdown about how hopeless I felt and how disappointed I was</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re in those emotional states and when you&rsquo;re like hopeless and you&rsquo;re like fuck it for what</p>
<p>That is your sign. You need to do something differently something needs to change</p>
<p>Now you can look for a medication you can look for a air quote cure</p>
<p>to fix the problem</p>
<p>Or you can look for the changes that you need to make there&rsquo;s two different directions. You can go in</p>
<p>And the mental health community does not typically go in the one where you help yourself</p>
<p>They run to the one of like shove a medication down your throat and do all these different things</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like personal accountability</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like taking control of your own life and helping yourself and making the changes that you need to make so you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>so helpless</p>
<p>Changing your thought patterns or questioning your beliefs and the meanings you&rsquo;re assigning to experiences</p>
<p>That shit will shift your mindset in two seconds and it will shift your entire everything</p>
<p>Because the way that you feel about something is based off of your perception of it. So</p>
<p>The way that you&rsquo;re looking at something is dictating how you&rsquo;re feeling about it</p>
<p>If you can change the way you look at something it will immediately change the way you feel about it</p>
<p>and when I learned this</p>
<p>I exercise this for like years</p>
<p>Like i&rsquo;ve been doing this for a long time and it&rsquo;s helped me so much and that is why I created my app</p>
<p>Because I was at a point where I couldn&rsquo;t find help</p>
<p>What everyone else was doing wasn&rsquo;t working for me. It never worked for me to feel better. So</p>
<p>I figured it out for my fucking self</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Now I turned it into a resource for other people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not plugging my app right now to plug it</p>
<p>So i&rsquo;m like, oh people everyone go download everyone go so I can make some money. Like my point is</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Found something that worked for me and now i&rsquo;m sharing it with other people</p>
<p>This is just a very fitting position if you don&rsquo;t want to get it don&rsquo;t get it, but i&rsquo;m telling you personally</p>
<p>From my experience. This is what&rsquo;s helped me. This is what has gotten me off the ledge so many times</p>
<p>This is what has instantly shifted my reality</p>
<p>So many times is the questions that I ask myself</p>
<p>And the shit that i&rsquo;ve put into my app like all the journal prompts all the different topics you can go into</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s questions in each one and they&rsquo;re meant to flip your perspective about what you&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>My app is called positive focus for a reason</p>
<p>I will put the link in the description of this podcast if you want to check it out</p>
<p>I really hope you do check it out because it&rsquo;s been really helpful for me like I use it as a tool</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>I can think rationally and I can think logically</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not upset, but when I am upset about something</p>
<p>I actually go into my own app and use it because like I said when i&rsquo;m in the high emotional states</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think logically i&rsquo;m not seeing things correctly</p>
<p>So when I go in I already have like the logic and the reason set out for myself so I can use it</p>
<p>You know what? I mean? Like think myself out of shit and think in a better direction</p>
<p>So people always yelling about their disorder i&rsquo;m depressed i&rsquo;m anxious i&rsquo;m this i&rsquo;m that it&rsquo;s their immediate way of being relieved of the pressure</p>
<p>To behave a certain way or to do certain things like it&rsquo;s letting people know</p>
<p>Like the example with the handicap. It&rsquo;s letting people know i&rsquo;m in a wheelchair</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mentally in a wheelchair like I don&rsquo;t something&rsquo;s wrong with me upstairs</p>
<p>And the way that you are able to handle things I have some kind of deficiency</p>
<p>So you need to cut me slack you need to be understanding to me</p>
<p>But the part that I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>Is when people try to use it as an excuse</p>
<p>That I do not fuck with because I am very big on</p>
<p>Personal accountability and taking responsibility for shit and owning up when you need to</p>
<p>I do not think that these over popularized</p>
<p>Mental disorders and diagnoses the ones that i&rsquo;ve mentioned in this</p>
<p>Are an excuse or should ever be allowed to be an excuse for blatant disrespect</p>
<p>Or being inconsiderate towards others</p>
<p>I get it. You&rsquo;re dealing with your own shit</p>
<p>You have your own things you&rsquo;re worrying about but that&rsquo;s not an excuse for you to disregard others</p>
<p>And a lot of people use it to not have to take on responsibility like they don&rsquo;t push their self and make their self actually</p>
<p>Work towards something or do something like they just use it to be able to sit on their ass. I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Because i&rsquo;m not like that</p>
<p>Everyone wants to get out of having to do shit. I like to do shit</p>
<p>But you can absolutely tell when someone is milking their diagnosis as an excuse versus when they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just letting you know that they have it</p>
<p>And I just want to let all y&rsquo;all fruitcakes know that do milk your fucking diagnosis and use it as an excuse</p>
<p>We all think you&rsquo;re fucking pathetic</p>
<p>Because none of us can say it because then we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re the bad people for making fun of someone that&rsquo;s handicapped</p>
<p>Because when we call you on your fucking shit, you like to flip into the victim role</p>
<p>But we know when you&rsquo;re milking it</p>
<p>If you use your diagnosis as an excuse to be an asshole eat shit</p>
<p>This is where all you bitches are going to want to fight and tussle</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s do it. Like I will totally take into consideration</p>
<p>if someone has</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>Deficiency or issue or something working against them. I will totally</p>
<p>Always take that into consideration</p>
<p>But I will not let you use it as a crutch. I will not let you use it as an excuse when it comes to me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, very fair and i&rsquo;m very understanding</p>
<p>And I will always cut slack when there it needs to be cut like i&rsquo;m aware enough to know when someone needs help</p>
<p>Versus when they&rsquo;re just fucking around</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a lot of people are doing nowadays on social media</p>
<p>Is they&rsquo;re using this shit as like an excuse and they&rsquo;re also doing it for like pity and sympathy</p>
<p>Like I said the whole cut me slack thing people use it to be quirky people use it to be like look</p>
<p>Yeah, well i&rsquo;m struggling with this thing. Look how strong I am. I&rsquo;m dealing with this</p>
<p>Look it and i&rsquo;m doing so good. Look at it&rsquo;s a weird like fucking dynamic and i&rsquo;m watching it unfold</p>
<p>And so much in the younger generations and i&rsquo;m like, oh my god</p>
<p>Like i&rsquo;m 23 and i&rsquo;m over here like in the year</p>
<p>I watch it in the younger generations. Like i&rsquo;m not fucking gen z over here. Jesus christ</p>
<p>I just feel mentally like 105. I don&rsquo;t get it. I don&rsquo;t relate to these fucking people these little teeny boppers. I don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>So I do want to offer a solution to you guys because like I said, I recently went through one of these deep like</p>
<p>Pits of like a depressive episode</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to call it or what to label it because it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t want to call it depression</p>
<p>But I went through this period where I felt this just like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done. Like i&rsquo;m sick of it. I&rsquo;m tired. Like i&rsquo;m just done trying</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>It just made me so</p>
<p>fucking sad</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just this feeling state</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this wake up one day and you have this all of a sudden like sense of like doom</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just fucking over it. You&rsquo;re sick of it. You&rsquo;re ready to just throw your fucking hands up. I have these often like</p>
<p>every few months</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get one of these episodes</p>
<p>every single time</p>
<p>I have one of these like it&rsquo;s like a roller coaster or like a ditch like if you are walking in a field</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this giant hole in the ground i&rsquo;m talking like 50 feet fucking down and it&rsquo;s like 10 feet like diameter</p>
<p>So like you fall into this hole and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re sitting at the bottom of it</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like what the fuck do I do you&rsquo;re meant to go into it</p>
<p>Because there is a treasure at the bottom</p>
<p>Every single fucking time I go through one of these episodes where i&rsquo;m really really sad</p>
<p>It always leads to me becoming aware of something</p>
<p>Huge I fall into the fucking pit of</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeless. I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m done. I just want to lay here at the bottom of this hole</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t give a fuck anymore and then i&rsquo;ll find the treasure</p>
<p>Which is the awareness or whatever?</p>
<p>I needed to learn will come to my awareness and then I will get</p>
<p>The urge to climb out not that something comes to save me and pulls me out. I get that</p>
<p>I want to go again</p>
<p>Not that i&rsquo;m hopeless anymore</p>
<p>And then I go with the new realization that i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>And it I pull myself out of the hole and I keep fucking walking forward a few months later. I have a new</p>
<p>Ditch that I fall into</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how it keeps going</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;ve learned to start getting excited when these happen because I know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m meant to become aware of something fucking huge. Like i&rsquo;m about to make a huge change to my life</p>
<p>Now a lot of people get stuck in these holes because they try to cope their way out of them</p>
<p>I lay in the bottom of them for like three days</p>
<p>I will just sit there in the shitty fucking feelings and the whole fuck it. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with everything like I will just let myself feel it</p>
<p>And then through venting about it to like my mom or my sister or my friends like i&rsquo;ll just vent about it</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t act on it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just vent about it and like sit with how i&rsquo;m feeling and then the realization will come</p>
<p>After as i&rsquo;m like venting every time I swear</p>
<p>But other people will see their self in this hole and shame their self</p>
<p>Oh my god</p>
<p>Look at how much you have to be grateful for</p>
<p>They find something wrong with the way that they feel and they try to shame their self into getting up</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>Or they try to ignore the fact that they&rsquo;re in the hole. They try to numb it out drugs alcohol</p>
<p>They try to numb out the way that they&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>That gets you stuck in the hole. The only way out is through</p>
<p>So if you want to get out of the emotions that you&rsquo;re feeling you have to go through them</p>
<p>You have to feel them</p>
<p>Let the emotions hang out like just hang out with them sit with them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to tell you something and teach you something. So pay attention quit running from it. I get it bitch</p>
<p>Let me let me slow it down because I understand the coping thing. I cope everybody copes</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just too much and you&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t want to deal with it yet</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll cope for a little bit and then you&rsquo;ll be ready to face them and that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>I could do an entire podcast on coping. I&rsquo;m probably not going to because that&rsquo;s a slippery fucking slope</p>
<p>Like this one is not i&rsquo;m over here at the water park with these fucking</p>
<p>topics I keep picking</p>
<p>But yeah, i&rsquo;ve just learned with the hole every time I get in the hole</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a realization to come out of it</p>
<p>but it is really hard to remind yourself of like</p>
<p>There is something coming out of this while you&rsquo;re in it because every single time I go through it I forget</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, really down and i&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>This might be it</p>
<p>But every single time I come out of it</p>
<p>And I find a little treasure and then i&rsquo;m on my fucking way</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the way that i&rsquo;ve wrapped it up in my mind is like I find a little treasure</p>
<p>But I promise like awareness will set you free. That is the only thing that will set you fucking free</p>
<p>That is the little treasure</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use an example from my podcast episode number eight</p>
<p>Expressing you&rsquo;re uncomfortable</p>
<p>So remember how I said i&rsquo;ve never felt considered by people and i&rsquo;ve always just felt people don&rsquo;t really give a fuck</p>
<p>That pushed me into a hole one time. I was at the bottom of the hole of like</p>
<p>trying to</p>
<p>Deal with people is fucking useless. I&rsquo;m always let down. I&rsquo;m always hurt. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>Pointless like I literally got to the point where I was so helpless. Like why even bother trying to be around people?</p>
<p>Why even bother trying to rely on others or like hope for the best?</p>
<p>Like every time I had tried to have hope I was let down</p>
<p>I got pushed into one of those holes and then I got the awareness</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>How I was contributing</p>
<p>And how if I want to be considered</p>
<p>I need to express the true way that i&rsquo;m feeling if I want people to accommodate me and to show me that they care</p>
<p>About me. I have to put them in positions where they can show that and I wasn&rsquo;t doing that</p>
<p>So that was the little treasure that I got</p>
<p>That made me want to get the fuck up and climb out of the hole and keep running because that&rsquo;s what I did</p>
<p>I realized that wasn&rsquo;t as hopeless as I thought and there was things that I could change and the way that I was living</p>
<p>Had to fully shift</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing a lot of people don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to see where they have control and where they need to be accountable</p>
<p>So they stay stuck in the hole</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t gain the awareness or if they do gain the awareness, they&rsquo;ll talk theirself out of it</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really though. You can&rsquo;t talk yourself out of awareness, babe</p>
<p>Once it hits you and hits your consciousness, you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>You can make the change or you can die in the hole</p>
<p>But sitting at the bottom of that hole is going to become a lot more uncomfortable once you become aware</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just going to be able to sit there and throw your hands up anymore</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re going to become aware of there are things you can do and there are changes to be made</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;re going to be at a part of like well fuck</p>
<p>I just had a realization while I was filming this. I&rsquo;m a very visual person</p>
<p>So when I keep saying the fall in the hole and the shit like that and like there&rsquo;s a treasure in it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, very visual. I like images and I see awareness as images and like visuals</p>
<p>So like I said when you&rsquo;re walking through the field</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have a map in your hands and you&rsquo;re following this map and then over time shit just ain&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not taking you to the right fucking spots. It&rsquo;s like defective. It&rsquo;s not working. You&rsquo;re frustrated. You&rsquo;re pissed off</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what to do. You&rsquo;re like hopeless with this fucking map. Then you fall in the hole</p>
<p>Then you find a new map. So like the treasure I keep talking about is awareness. So like</p>
<p>You gain the awareness you find the new map of the new route you can take</p>
<p>Because at the point when you had that map and you&rsquo;ve exhausted all your options, you don&rsquo;t see any more routes</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see anything else</p>
<p>so your only way to find more is to fall into that fucking pit and find that new map like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Emotions, like I said are meant to teach you something</p>
<p>So you need to go into that fucking pit to find your new avenues for life to find the changes</p>
<p>You need to make to find the new paths to go down</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the bottom of the hole</p>
<p>So get excited when you get depressed bitch and then hang out</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna find the new map in like three to five business days</p>
<p>I wish it was that simple. It&rsquo;s a lot harder, but that&rsquo;s the visual I can give you because that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like for me</p>
<p>So since I mentioned my app I am going to tell you if you have some kind of mental disorder or diagnosis</p>
<p>You can plug that into the journal topic of pain and injury</p>
<p>Just plug in what you&rsquo;ve got for that</p>
<p>And ask yourself those questions</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to spoil it and tell you what I think you&rsquo;re going to become aware of</p>
<p>But I will tell you</p>
<p>A lot of awareness awaits you with that one bitch like you better get ready and you got to be ready to face yourself</p>
<p>Once you start digging into</p>
<p>Why you have the diagnosis you have and how it&rsquo;s benefiting you as soon as you flip and start looking at that</p>
<p>Just watch</p>
<p>And another one you can look at if you&rsquo;re trying to look at old behaviors and old beliefs and like rework those</p>
<p>um is not getting something that you want that prompt will</p>
<p>Really help you become aware of this shit. That is like no longer serving you and what&rsquo;s actually holding you back</p>
<p>Like I said, i&rsquo;ll put the link in the bio of this if you want to check it out</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available on iphones and androids. It&rsquo;s called positive focus. It&rsquo;s the blue one with the eye real aesthetic real pretty</p>
<p>I tried to make it look futuristic like we looking into the future like that&rsquo;s so raven this bitch</p>
<p>I really did not base it up. That&rsquo;s a raven. I just came up with that. That&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>But yes, the biggest takeaway. I want every single person listening to this to take</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the way that you feel</p>
<p>Start looking at why you feel the way that you feel. What is making you feel the way that you feel?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the answer lies</p>
