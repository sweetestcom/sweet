Scott is not coming up to show you
code onscreen anytime soon,
but look, it&amp;rsquo;s an exciting time in tech.

    <p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p>SATYA NADELLA: Hi, everyone.</p>
<p>Welcome. It&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>to see all of you in Seattle in person.</p>
<p>We have an unbelievable show.</p>
<p>I see Scott Guthrie even wore his red shirt.</p>
<p>We welcome you to</p>
<p>the Azure Kubernetes Container Service 2023 launch.</p>
<p>No, don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll have some fun.</p>
<p>Scott is not coming up to show you</p>
<p>code onscreen anytime soon,</p>
<p>but look, it&rsquo;s an exciting time in tech.</p>
<p>The broad contours of</p>
<p>this next platform are</p>
<p>just getting clearer and clearer each day.</p>
<p>The advances, what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what obviously excites us in our industry.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also grounded</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s happening in the broader world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question. There are</p>
<p>enormous challenges out there.</p>
<p>In fact, it reminds me and I&rsquo;ve spoken about</p>
<p>this before of the very founding of Microsoft in 1975.</p>
<p>In fact, when the popular electronics cover</p>
<p>came out with the Altair,</p>
<p>which of course our founders</p>
<p>picked up and ran with it and</p>
<p>created essentially what&rsquo;s the software industry</p>
<p>as we know of it today.</p>
<p>That same week,</p>
<p>Newsweek had a cover with President Carter</p>
<p>trying to fight off</p>
<p>the three-headed monster of inflation,</p>
<p>recession, and an energy crisis.</p>
<p>Today you&rsquo;d have something similar.</p>
<p>You will have AI on one cover and</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll have those three challenges</p>
<p>plus for good measure,</p>
<p>we can add a few more.</p>
<p>We, as Microsoft,</p>
<p>we as the tech industry have to really</p>
<p>ground ourselves in how do we relate one to the other?</p>
<p>In other words, can we use technology to overcome</p>
<p>the challenges that people and</p>
<p>organizations and countries face?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the pursuit here.</p>
<p>In that context, I would say,</p>
<p>I just want to share a couple of</p>
<p>anecdotes which gives me great hope.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, it gives me personally a lot of</p>
<p>satisfaction around working at Microsoft,</p>
<p>working in this industry to</p>
<p>push the state of the art of technology.</p>
<p>The first one, obviously when Sam and</p>
<p>his team late last year launched ChatGPT,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only thing anybody your friends and</p>
<p>family wanted to talk about throughout the holidays.</p>
<p>It was just crazy house.</p>
<p>It was like the Mosaic moment.</p>
<p>The closest we&rsquo;ve come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 30 years now since when Mosaic launch,</p>
<p>which I distinctly remember.</p>
<p>It was very exciting time.</p>
<p>I went on a holiday first and then I was in</p>
<p>the first week of January I was in India.</p>
<p>On Jan 1st,</p>
<p>I look at my news feed and I see</p>
<p>this tweet that Andrej Karpathy put out.</p>
<p>Who is our ex OpenAI and Tesla,</p>
<p>and is now an independent AI developer.</p>
<p>He had this thing about the product that really he</p>
<p>was most excited about the previous year was</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot and he was saying how 80 percent of</p>
<p>his code was being generated by this,</p>
<p>I would say first at</p>
<p>scale product built on NLM technology.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>80 percent somehow not doing his work.</p>
<p>In fact, he&rsquo;s getting so much more leverage.</p>
<p>In fact, recently we crossed</p>
<p>100 million developers on GitHub.</p>
<p>Think about this. There are</p>
<p>100 million developers on GitHub.</p>
<p>If we can improve their productivity,</p>
<p>just like how Andrej was able to observe.</p>
<p>Then let&rsquo;s say in the next decade we double that number,</p>
<p>may be double it again.</p>
<p>We get close to a half a billion developers,</p>
<p>what economic opportunity it would create.</p>
<p>Because there is not a meeting that I</p>
<p>go to today with any CEO,</p>
<p>CXO of any organization who&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>looking for more software developers,</p>
<p>more digital skills.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the currency in every sector of the economy,</p>
<p>in every country of the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opportunity we</p>
<p>have to be able to take</p>
<p>this technology and make a difference.</p>
<p>But then the next day I went</p>
<p>to Mumbai and then I saw this demo.</p>
<p>This was just for me,</p>
<p>the most profound thing that I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time.</p>
<p>The demo was actually built by</p>
<p>the Ministry of Electronics in</p>
<p>India because they are building</p>
<p>out a digital public goods.</p>
<p>Their idea is look, India has got</p>
<p>multiple official languages and they wanted to</p>
<p>democratize essentially access to language translation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re building it out as a digital public good.</p>
<p>In fact, Microsoft and Azure and</p>
<p>Microsoft Research are all involved in that project.</p>
<p>This is basically speech-to-text,</p>
<p>text-to-speech across all of the languages in India.</p>
<p>They showed me this demo where</p>
<p>a farmer speaking in</p>
<p>Hindi expresses a pretty complex thought</p>
<p>about how he had heard</p>
<p>about some government program and wants to</p>
<p>apply for a subsidy that he thinks he&rsquo;s eligible for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty complex prompt query.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s technology,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good job.</p>
<p>It goes to the bot, recognizes the speech,</p>
<p>comes back and says, you know what?</p>
<p>You should go to this portal,</p>
<p>fill out these forms,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll get your subsidy.</p>
<p>He says, look, I&rsquo;m not going to go into any portal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to fill out any forms,</p>
<p>can you help me? He does it.</p>
<p>Then I was told that a developer said, you know what?</p>
<p>That is Daisy Ching a model that was</p>
<p>trained on all of the documents of</p>
<p>the government of India using</p>
<p>GPT with this speech recognition software.</p>
<p>Basically two models coming together to really</p>
<p>help a rural farmer in India</p>
<p>trying to get access to a government program.</p>
<p>Look, I grew up in India.</p>
<p>I dreamt every day that someday</p>
<p>the industrial revolution will get evenly</p>
<p>distributed across the world.</p>
<p>Here I was,</p>
<p>seeing something so profound,</p>
<p>something that is developed by the folks at</p>
<p>OpenAI in the West Coast of</p>
<p>the United States a few months earlier,</p>
<p>used by a developer locally</p>
<p>to have an impact on a rural farmer.</p>
<p>That to me is what gives</p>
<p>me meaning and I think gives</p>
<p>us all meaning in our industry.</p>
<p>It is just fantastic to see that.</p>
<p>Now of course we&rsquo;ve got to scale it and scale</p>
<p>it with a real understanding that we can break things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about being also clear-eyed about</p>
<p>the unintended consequences of any new technology.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s why way back in</p>
<p>2016 is when we came out with the AI principles.</p>
<p>You have both we as Microsoft and our partners at OpenAI,</p>
<p>deeply care about this.</p>
<p>In fact, the entire genesis of</p>
<p>OpenAI is from that foundation.</p>
<p>We built these principles,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve not just put those principles as a document,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve been practicing it because that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>technology gets better in this particular case.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about AI, it&rsquo;s about alignment with</p>
<p>human preferences and societal norms</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to do that in a lab.</p>
<p>You have to do that out there in the world.</p>
<p>It starts by the way with design decision ones makes.</p>
<p>When you think about AI, you</p>
<p>can have the human in the loop,</p>
<p>you can hear how the human on</p>
<p>the loop or you can have the human out of the loop.</p>
<p>Those are decisions we as product makers build,</p>
<p>build into the products.</p>
<p>Whenever we have come up with</p>
<p>some new things and new models,</p>
<p>we in fact put a premium on human agency.</p>
<p>When you think about these generative AI models,</p>
<p>remember one thing, they are prompted to do things.</p>
<p>The prompting comes from a human being.</p>
<p>We get to in fact help them prompt.</p>
<p>We get them to take the draft that gets generated.</p>
<p>They should review the draft.</p>
<p>They get to review the draft,</p>
<p>they get to approve the draft using judgment.</p>
<p>We want to give them as many perspectives,</p>
<p>as many ways to regenerate.</p>
<p>We want to take even just the design of AI products as</p>
<p>a first-class construct and build that into our products.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not sufficient, we realize that.</p>
<p>You have to write at</p>
<p>the pre-training stage when it comes to the data,</p>
<p>the pre-training itself, the model itself has to be safe.</p>
<p>The safety system around the model,</p>
<p>the application context, all will matter.</p>
<p>We absolutely, and you&rsquo;ll see that today,</p>
<p>we take all of that as</p>
<p>first-class things which we want to reduce,</p>
<p>not just to principles but to engineering practice.</p>
<p>Such that we can build AI</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more aligned with human values,</p>
<p>more aligned with what our preferences are,</p>
<p>both individually and as a society.</p>
<p>What is it that we should do and what should we build?</p>
<p>I think that this technology is going to reshape</p>
<p>pretty much every software category.</p>
<p>We know, we&rsquo;ve seen that and we&rsquo;ve solved.</p>
<p>If you think about the web, we&rsquo;ve had what?</p>
<p>Three at least very distinct platform shifts</p>
<p>that have shaped the web.</p>
<p>The web was born on the PC and</p>
<p>the server and then it evolved with mobile and Cloud.</p>
<p>Now the question is,</p>
<p>how is AI going to reshape the web?</p>
<p>Each time in each one of those phases,</p>
<p>some real foundational technology layers,</p>
<p>sometimes I describe them as</p>
<p>these organizational layers of technology, were born.</p>
<p>The browser was the first one.</p>
<p>Without the browser, the web would have not</p>
<p>been as popular as it is today.</p>
<p>Same thing with search.</p>
<p>Search organized the web.</p>
<p>Then when it came to the mobile</p>
<p>generation and mobile and Cloud,</p>
<p>in fact these super apps,</p>
<p>especially outside of the United States around messaging,</p>
<p>became the way people consume the web.</p>
<p>We also had app stores.</p>
<p>The question is, what are the constructs?</p>
<p>What are the organizing layers going forward?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see some of that today.</p>
<p>We think there are two things that are emerging.</p>
<p>One is this conversational intelligent agents.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re going to be things that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have everywhere we go.</p>
<p>All computer interaction is</p>
<p>going to be mediated with an agent helping you.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re going to have this notion of a</p>
<p>co-pilot that&rsquo;s going to be there</p>
<p>across every application canvas inside of</p>
<p>an operating system shell in a browser.</p>
<p>We want to show you some of this innovation starting with</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s going to reshape</p>
<p>the largest software category on planet Earth,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been working on for a long time,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re very, very excited about, Search.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new day in Search.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new paradigm for search.</p>
<p>Rapid innovation is going to come.</p>
<p>In fact, a race starts</p>
<p>today in terms of</p>
<p>what you can expect and we&rsquo;re going to move.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to move fast.</p>
<p>For us every day,</p>
<p>we want to bring out new things.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we want to have</p>
<p>a lot of fun innovating</p>
<p>again in Search because it&rsquo;s high time.</p>
<p>With that, let me turn it over to Yusuf.</p>
<p>YUSUF MEHDI: Thanks, Satya. It&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>to be here with all of you today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working on something we think is pretty</p>
<p>special and we&rsquo;re just eager to share it with you.</p>
<p>In my time at the company,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky to witness a few important moments.</p>
<p>I think this might be another one of those.</p>
<p>We believe as Satya said that we can improve</p>
<p>the way billions of people can benefit from the Internet.</p>
<p>Created by really an amazing team across Microsoft,</p>
<p>from the core web engineering folks in Michael&rsquo;s group,</p>
<p>to the brilliant folks at Microsoft Research,</p>
<p>to the tireless people that work on</p>
<p>the Azure AI supercomputer,</p>
<p>we think of it humbly as</p>
<p>the next-generation of search and browsing.</p>
<p>Infused with AI and</p>
<p>assembled as an integrated experience,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to re-imagine the search engine,</p>
<p>the web browser, and new chat experiences</p>
<p>into something we think of as your copilot for the web.</p>
<p>Now, copilot is a critical word because we</p>
<p>believe in the empowering nature of AI in which you,</p>
<p>the individual, are in charge.</p>
<p>Now what it is, is not even as</p>
<p>important as what it represents.</p>
<p>That is for us an aspiration</p>
<p>to unlock the joy of discovery,</p>
<p>the wonder of creation,</p>
<p>and that feeling of empowerment from</p>
<p>being able to harness the world&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>
<p>At the center of this new co-pilot experience is</p>
<p>an all new Bing search engine and Edge web browser,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to do four things for you.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s a better search.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the search you know and love but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better because it&rsquo;s AI powered.</p>
<p>Second, not only does it give you the search results,</p>
<p>but it will actually answer your questions.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;re going to make it incredibly easy to use.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to let you chat, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>let you just talk to it naturally.</p>
<p>Last, when you need that spark of creativity,</p>
<p>Bing can generate content for</p>
<p>you automatically to help you get started.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about the opportunity</p>
<p>in search and why</p>
<p>we believe we&rsquo;re at the start of the next generation.</p>
<p>No. Sorry about that, we&rsquo;re on to the next generation.</p>
<p>All seriousness, with</p>
<p>over 10 billion queries a day,</p>
<p>we all know the search engine is an incredible tool.</p>
<p>We do. Yet as the web has grown,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve run into challenges.</p>
<p>People are overwhelmed increasingly with</p>
<p>too many links when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to find simple answers.</p>
<p>But 40 percent of the time people click on search links,</p>
<p>they click back immediately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign they&rsquo;re not finding what they want.</p>
<p>Most notably, we have to adapt to</p>
<p>search versus the other way around.</p>
<p>It turns out search works better</p>
<p>if you give it fewer keywords.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to know that 75 percent of</p>
<p>all searches are three key words or less.</p>
<p>But come on, we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<p>Search has remained fundamentally</p>
<p>the same since the last major inflection.</p>
<p>When we moved from a directory approach to</p>
<p>search to an algorithmic approach to search.</p>
<p>The user experience and the approach</p>
<p>underlying are essentially the same as 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Few keywords and you get millions of links.</p>
<p>But as the world around us has changed,</p>
<p>the way people use search has changed, we all know this.</p>
<p>People are trying to use search to do</p>
<p>more than it was designed to do.</p>
<p>To illustrate that let&rsquo;s just look at a breakdown</p>
<p>of search queries by type to understand this point.</p>
<p>Search querries today you can bucket them</p>
<p>into serve three types of categories.</p>
<p>The first are what we call navigational.</p>
<p>This is people searching for a website.</p>
<p>When you need to renew your driver&rsquo;s license,</p>
<p>you need to go to the DMV.</p>
<p>When you want to tell your friend</p>
<p>about that great pizza place,</p>
<p>you send them the WebLink.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what search was designed to do,</p>
<p>and it does it super well.</p>
<p>The second, third of categories</p>
<p>are what we call informational.</p>
<p>These are things like what&rsquo;s the weather forecast?</p>
<p>What was last night sports scores?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s stock price?</p>
<p>Search works great for that.</p>
<p>But for anything more complex, like hey,</p>
<p>I got to pick up this love seat at the store,</p>
<p>is it going to fit in the back of my car?</p>
<p>Search is going to fall short on that.</p>
<p>Then the final third,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back into what we call everything else.</p>
<p>These are typically more deep research in nature.</p>
<p>This is things like trip planning or complex shopping.</p>
<p>An example query here that people are putting in is, hey,</p>
<p>can you recommend a five-day itinerary to Mexico City?</p>
<p>For these, search falls far short of the desired goal.</p>
<p>What this means if you just do the simple math,</p>
<p>it means that roughly half of</p>
<p>all searches aren&rsquo;t delivering the job that people want.</p>
<p>If you go on that 10 million queries,</p>
<p>it means that every second,</p>
<p>50,000 people searches potentially go unanswered.</p>
<p>This is why we believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time for a new approach in search.</p>
<p>For the billions of queries that are going unanswered,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen new attempts to try address the problem.</p>
<p>As you all know, there are vertical search attempts.</p>
<p>Amazon has done a better job for shopping.</p>
<p>YouTube is great for video.</p>
<p>Reddit is a great place to come get advice.</p>
<p>The benefits of search are well-known.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s timely,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a great business model.</p>
<p>Then more recently they&rsquo;ve been another vector,</p>
<p>more disruptive ideas like leveraging AI to</p>
<p>answer questions directly and to generate content.</p>
<p>These are amazing as well,</p>
<p>and they show what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But what if you could get the two to come together?</p>
<p>Not only would you get two things in one,</p>
<p>but we think you could actually solve problems in each.</p>
<p>We think you could get to something that is</p>
<p>really one plus one equals three.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that with the new Bing.</p>
<p>I want to share with you</p>
<p>four technical breakthroughs the Team</p>
<p>has achieved to make this come to life.</p>
<p>First, through our fantastic partnership</p>
<p>with SAM and the brilliant team at OpenAI,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that Bing is running on</p>
<p>a new next-generation large language model.</p>
<p>One that is much more powerful than ChatGPT,</p>
<p>and one that is customized specifically for search.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlike anything you&rsquo;ve had a chance to play</p>
<p>with and we can&rsquo;t wait for you to try it.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;ve developed a proprietary way of working</p>
<p>with OpenAI that allows us to best leverage the power.</p>
<p>We call this collection of capabilities and</p>
<p>techniques the Prometheus model.</p>
<p>The core idea here is that both</p>
<p>at training and at runtime,</p>
<p>we engage with the OpenAI model more</p>
<p>intelligently through our knowledge of the web,</p>
<p>via the Bing index and some special query techniques.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to dig into this a little bit more later,</p>
<p>but the benefits are the following.</p>
<p>First, we can improve</p>
<p>the relevancy of answers by feeding in</p>
<p>and better tuning queries given</p>
<p>our understanding of the web search index.</p>
<p>Next, we can annotate</p>
<p>the answers with specific web links and citations.</p>
<p>We can get you more up-to-date</p>
<p>information because search crawls the web every day.</p>
<p>We can improve understanding of geolocation.</p>
<p>Finally, we can increase</p>
<p>the safety of the answers as well by catching</p>
<p>queries at initiation and then</p>
<p>checking that again at the delivery of an answer.</p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ve been making</p>
<p>steady improvements on the Bing algorithms for years.</p>
<p>We test these with independent judges.</p>
<p>The shows that are search experience is on par or</p>
<p>better than any search experience</p>
<p>when you take away the brands.</p>
<p>But a few weeks ago, something special happened.</p>
<p>We applied the AI model to</p>
<p>our core search ranking engine and we</p>
<p>saw the largest jump in relevance in two decades.</p>
<p>We believe we can continue to drive</p>
<p>breakthroughs as we improve the models.</p>
<p>Then finally, we are re-imagining how you</p>
<p>interact with all of these capabilities across search,</p>
<p>browser, and chat by</p>
<p>pulling them into a unified experience.</p>
<p>I want you to think about search</p>
<p>coming together with answers,</p>
<p>search coming together with chat,</p>
<p>and search coming together with the browser.</p>
<p>As we all know and as the folks at OpenAI taught us,</p>
<p>the user experience is as important as</p>
<p>the underlying technical platform. Enough talk.</p>
<p>You guys ready to see it in action?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s show you how we&rsquo;re going to enable</p>
<p>the Copilot for the web.</p>
<p>Now before I do, I want to call</p>
<p>out two things for clarity.</p>
<p>First, because there&rsquo;s so much I&rsquo;m going to show you</p>
<p>until you don&rsquo;t have to watch me type every search.</p>
<p>I recorded these searches live just yesterday.</p>
<p>Second, in case there are skeptics in the room,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get a chance to play with it directly,</p>
<p>put your hands on it and type the same queries as well</p>
<p>as your own favorites right after this presentation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all familiar with search,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not going to show you a search.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to share what you can&rsquo;t do with today&rsquo;s search.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to focus on answers,</p>
<p>chat, and the ability to create.</p>
<p>But first let me introduce you to the new Bing homepage.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to notice some subtle but important changes.</p>
<p>First, we have an expanded search box</p>
<p>capable of accepting up to 1,000 characters.</p>
<p>Because now Bing works with natural language.</p>
<p>You saw a little hint to chat,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m going to get back to in a second.</p>
<p>Now want to set up the first search scenario.</p>
<p>My daughter and I, we both love art.</p>
<p>She studied art at school and I&rsquo;d like to stay</p>
<p>connected with her on our mutual passion.</p>
<p>Last semester, she was learning about Mexican painters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to get a quick summary of</p>
<p>the most influential Mexican painters</p>
<p>and the works to learn a bit more about the topic.</p>
<p>If I type the full query of what I&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>know in today&rsquo;s search, here&rsquo;s what I get.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just type in, compare</p>
<p>the most influential Mexican artists</p>
<p>and their top paintings,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get what you expect. In some links.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine, but we can do better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try this now in the new Bing.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll see as we pull up, is first,</p>
<p>you see the web results here on the left,</p>
<p>but then on the right, you start to see</p>
<p>how we start to compile the answer.</p>
<p>What you get here now is we have</p>
<p>the ability to highlight these web links.</p>
<p>We can annotate the results.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re able to go in and</p>
<p>apply our index onto the answers there.</p>
<p>In other words, the answers and</p>
<p>the search on one page has</p>
<p>saved me a huge amount of time.</p>
<p>This gives you a little bit of a</p>
<p>sense of what you can do.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve seen some of this before,</p>
<p>you might say, Hey, I&rsquo;ve seen some of these.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s show you how we can do some additional things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you another query.</p>
<p>Where we use the timeliness of search.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go ahead and ask about events in</p>
<p>Scottsdale during the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll see is we get back and answer here,</p>
<p>where we have events and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to do that because Bing cross web.</p>
<p>Notice how we can find not only</p>
<p>that the Super Bowl was played in Glendale on the 12th,</p>
<p>but then there are events like</p>
<p>Cardi B Super Bowl party that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the 10th also shows up.</p>
<p>We were able to pull these things together.</p>
<p>You start to get a sense of how we can build on what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>today with the Bing index.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to show you a few</p>
<p>more of these types of answers quickly,</p>
<p>so you can get a sense of the power,</p>
<p>and the time savings from Bing.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m running an errand,</p>
<p>like the example I gave to you earlier,</p>
<p>I can ask Bing to determine if</p>
<p>that new loveseat from IKEA is</p>
<p>going to fit in the back of my Honda Odyssey.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll see is they can</p>
<p>actually find the dimensions of the loveseat,</p>
<p>the interior space of the car,</p>
<p>and then make an estimation as to whether it will fit.</p>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;m choosing</p>
<p>an example of where Bing does not know the answer.</p>
<p>We know that we can&rsquo;t be definitive about it.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m doing that is because we know we</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be able to answer every question, every time.</p>
<p>But Bing can still provide</p>
<p>some helpful information as you can see on this answer.</p>
<p>We also know we&rsquo;ll make our share of mistakes,</p>
<p>and Bing rule this out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added a quick feedback button</p>
<p>at the top of every search,</p>
<p>so that you can give us feedback and we can learn.</p>
<p>Another example, when I&rsquo;m shopping,</p>
<p>I can ask Bing to search, find,</p>
<p>and compare the top three selling pet vacuums</p>
<p>listing the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Look how great this answer is.</p>
<p>It has all three of the products I&rsquo;m looking for,</p>
<p>super-helpful pros and cons. Stop and think.</p>
<p>If you had to compile that,</p>
<p>how much time that would take you to do?</p>
<p>As you can see at the top of the page,</p>
<p>we still have the advertising in this example,</p>
<p>because we know when people are</p>
<p>shopping, those ads are helpful.</p>
<p>Finally on this one, if I&rsquo;m cooking,</p>
<p>and I realize I&rsquo;ve forgotten</p>
<p>a key ingredient, in this case, e.g.</p>
<p>eggs for my cake recipe,</p>
<p>Bing can not only find the egg substitutes,</p>
<p>it can get me the exact amount for each ingredient.</p>
<p>Take a look at this.</p>
<p>I love this. You can actually see e.g.</p>
<p>if you go with vinegar and baking soda,</p>
<p>the cake is lighter and more fluffy.</p>
<p>These are just little helpful tips that</p>
<p>everyday help make your life a little better.</p>
<p>These are just some examples.</p>
<p>Then you can start to get a sense of how, with answers.</p>
<p>We go far beyond what you can do with search day.</p>
<p>We can actually help you get what you want to get done.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you about how</p>
<p>Bing goes further to help you with</p>
<p>particularly complex questions for</p>
<p>which there is not a precise answer.</p>
<p>I wanted to introduce to you</p>
<p>the new chat experience in Bing.</p>
<p>I think of this as search with your own personal helper,</p>
<p>to help you refine your query until</p>
<p>you get exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>This comes in handy for activities</p>
<p>like trip planning and shopping research.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with shopping. I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to look for 65 inch TV.</p>
<p>Again, you see ads at the top,</p>
<p>the result of the links on the left,</p>
<p>and the answer is here on the right.</p>
<p>You can pick whichever you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you a good set of answers.</p>
<p>But now I want to refine this query,</p>
<p>so I can do that by going into chat.</p>
<p>Now I can either swipe up with</p>
<p>my fingers or look up here at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>We have now a new chat scope.</p>
<p>With that, with one click,</p>
<p>you are now into chat.</p>
<p>Look how beautiful that is.</p>
<p>Searched to check, just so seamless.</p>
<p>Now we take away all of</p>
<p>the content that was in your place,</p>
<p>and you focus on your query.</p>
<p>The search box you can see,</p>
<p>now that can take up to 2.000 characters.</p>
<p>You can just talk to it. You can just ask for it.</p>
<p>In this case, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>ask for gaming optimized TV.</p>
<p>All I have to say is which of these are best for gaming?</p>
<p>We remember all of the context.</p>
<p>We know that we&rsquo;re talking about flat screens,</p>
<p>we know we&rsquo;re talking about 65-inch TV&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Look how Bing start to come back.</p>
<p>It does all the queries on</p>
<p>my behalf and comes back with a great answer.</p>
<p>I just want to highlight a few things for you.</p>
<p>Since we know you&rsquo;re asking about gaming TV&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we pull out, this one has</p>
<p>a game optimizer, this has Game Mode.</p>
<p>We make that really helpful. I&rsquo;m on a budget.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask it to adjust it for,</p>
<p>which one of these is the cheapest.</p>
<p>Again, Bing knows the context,</p>
<p>and it just goes in and refines the queries.</p>
<p>Easy, you just talk to it,</p>
<p>and you can refine your shopping experience.</p>
<p>Again, we find the prices here.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you could get a flat-screen for under $500,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a good deal there on</p>
<p>Bing if you&rsquo;re looking for TV.</p>
<p>We think that&rsquo;s going to make shopping</p>
<p>easier. Let&rsquo;s talk about travel.</p>
<p>Before I jump in, I want to</p>
<p>just have you remind yourself,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going to plan a trip to a foreign country,</p>
<p>think about all the things you go through.</p>
<p>Travel times, what sites do I want to see,</p>
<p>regulations to observe, budget.</p>
<p>Our research shows on Bing,</p>
<p>people spend on average weeks</p>
<p>to even months to plan a trip,</p>
<p>and to use our organizational tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you how we make that so</p>
<p>much easier with the new Bing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m traveling to Mexico for</p>
<p>my cousin&rsquo;s wedding, and with the new Bing,</p>
<p>I now don&rsquo;t have to start</p>
<p>with something that&rsquo;s dumbed down,</p>
<p>like Mexico City travel tips.</p>
<p>I can ask for what I want.</p>
<p>First, let me just compare that against</p>
<p>what you get in today&rsquo;s search engines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll type in this long query of what I really want,</p>
<p>and you get what you expect.</p>
<p>Links to go try to find the answer for yourself.</p>
<p>But we can do much better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try it in the new Bing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put in the long query,</p>
<p>which is essentially create an itinerary for</p>
<p>a five-day trip to Mexico City for me and my family.</p>
<p>Just like that, Bing Goes to work.</p>
<p>Just take a look at how it starts to compile.</p>
<p>Starts with Day 1, and we put it in there.</p>
<p>Look, arrive in Mexico City,</p>
<p>check into your hotel,</p>
<p>go check out maybe de Bella de Artes, have some lunch.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Day 2.</p>
<p>You see, isn&rsquo;t this just</p>
<p>so much better as a starting point?</p>
<p>Look, if you want to learn more, if you like, hey,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love these five days, no problem.</p>
<p>Down there, we have links where</p>
<p>you can go and learn more.</p>
<p>We put in some nice touches in there as well.</p>
<p>Again, now, let&rsquo;s say business travel changes.</p>
<p>Oh, I only have a three day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to go back out there and figure out.</p>
<p>I just say, Hey, make this a three-day trip,</p>
<p>and Bing reflows</p>
<p>that recommendation into a three-day trip.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s just have some fun.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, Okay, yeah, I&rsquo;m still trip planning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to shop, where can I shop?</p>
<p>You get some shopping recommendations.</p>
<p>Like to go out at night. Make the most of the trip.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the nightlife?</p>
<p>You get a list of nightlife.</p>
<p>You see this is just so much better than</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s search to start for your travel planning.</p>
<p>Let me show you a final example of chat and how I think</p>
<p>the new language models are going to maybe</p>
<p>help bring the world a little bit closer together.</p>
<p>Understanding different cultures is often</p>
<p>done through the arts like music and literature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by Japanese traditions.</p>
<p>[inaudible] share with me one of</p>
<p>his favorite searches from a while back on poetry.</p>
<p>With that, I&rsquo;m going to use that as inspiration.</p>
<p>Without a clear idea of what I want necessarily,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to type in a simple prompt,</p>
<p>top Japanese poets and</p>
<p>Bing starts to respond with a nice list.</p>
<p>You see this, it does a great job of</p>
<p>mixing the Japanese language and</p>
<p>the English language and it</p>
<p>knows since I&rsquo;m Korean and English to do that.</p>
<p>Right away, I learn about this poet, Matsuo Basho.</p>
<p>It turns out he is one</p>
<p>of the greatest haiku masters of the world.</p>
<p>I love how it now enlists his name,</p>
<p>but we go ahead and we give you one of his famous haikus</p>
<p>in Japanese and we auto-translate it in English.</p>
<p>Great. I can say, I want to learn</p>
<p>a little bit more about Matsuo.</p>
<p>I can say, tell me a little bit more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll give you another jumping-off point, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Then I can say, hey, tell me about another haiku.</p>
<p>Now, what I want you to reflect on is look how</p>
<p>easy this is to discover something new.</p>
<p>Normally, I might not have done this.</p>
<p>I might not have gone to learn about something</p>
<p>new in the world through search</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s cumbersome to</p>
<p>click on links and have to deal with foreign languages.</p>
<p>But this is what we mean</p>
<p>by unlocking the joy of discovery.</p>
<p>Finally, when what you are searching for</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist and you need that spark of creativity,</p>
<p>bank and generate the content to help you get started.</p>
<p>We just finished planning that trip to Mexico and now</p>
<p>what I would like to do is I&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>share that information with my family.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all over the world but I can simply ask Bing,</p>
<p>hey, write an email,</p>
<p>sharing this itinerary that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>researched and put it</p>
<p>into a thing for me to be able to send to my family.</p>
<p>Notice here how the emails starts, it&rsquo;s a great email.</p>
<p>Personalized touches, has the trip highlights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll close here with a nice heartfelt message</p>
<p>, it&rsquo;s just a grip.</p>
<p>It just saves a bunch of time on your everyday work.</p>
<p>Now, for my family,</p>
<p>English isn&rsquo;t necessarily always</p>
<p>the first language so I can</p>
<p>ask Bing to just translate that in Spanish.</p>
<p>With a simple request, just basically say, hey,</p>
<p>translate that to Spanish,</p>
<p>Bing knows to take that entire email and</p>
<p>itinerary and convert that into Spanish.</p>
<p>In fact, Bing can translate</p>
<p>automatically over 100 languages.</p>
<p>My sister, I&rsquo;m going to admit to you,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a better Spanish writer than I am,</p>
<p>but I might just impress her with this one here.</p>
<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t, I at least I saved</p>
<p>myself a lot of time from having to type the mail.</p>
<p>Our focus with Bing is to help generate</p>
<p>content and inspiration that</p>
<p>helps you with your daily life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you a couple of more examples.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s show you one here.</p>
<p>I want to create a weekly meal-plan for my family of</p>
<p>four that has vegetarian options</p>
<p>and caters to those who don&rsquo;t like nuts.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m not the healthiest of eater,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to admit to you here on occasion,</p>
<p>this has given me a great list day-by-day,</p>
<p>breakfast, lunch, and dinner with all of the ingredients.</p>
<p>So much easier to help you</p>
<p>start to create a meal plan that says,</p>
<p>hey, let me get to a healthier meal plan.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s some things</p>
<p>in there I learned when I did this query,</p>
<p>which is chia seeds, which I don&rsquo;t normally eat.</p>
<p>That sparked another idea to show you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to get this grocery list</p>
<p>by grocery section.</p>
<p>All I can do is say give me</p>
<p>that grocery list by groceries section.</p>
<p>Bing now takes that exact menu for the week and puts</p>
<p>all of the ingredients I</p>
<p>need by groceries section so when I go shopping,</p>
<p>now can be super efficient.</p>
<p>You see all of the ingredients there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great help.</p>
<p>Then finally, if you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>family activities and you&rsquo;re struggling for ideas,</p>
<p>Bing can help you with fun things</p>
<p>like spontaneous trivia games.</p>
<p>My family and I were into music so I</p>
<p>asked Bing to create a &rsquo;90s music trivia game.</p>
<p>Just look how great some of these questions</p>
<p>are and the answer so just creates that game for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a little debate backstage</p>
<p>about one of the questions that comes up here,</p>
<p>which is, who wrote the hips song, Jump Around?</p>
<p>Is it Kris Kross or House of Pain?</p>
<p>I call it out because it shows you how clever it is.</p>
<p>Because for those of you who know your &rsquo;90s hip-hop,</p>
<p>Kris Kross wrote a song called Jump,</p>
<p>but House of Pain was the one that wrote Jump Around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how clever Bing is.</p>
<p>Bing is going to help you look great with</p>
<p>your family and have a bunch of fun.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize where we are so far.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen better search.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen complete answers.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen an incredible new chat experience and</p>
<p>the ability to spark your creativity all with Bing,</p>
<p>your AI powered cop-out for the web.</p>
<p>But what if that&rsquo;s still too much work?</p>
<p>What if you could have that co-pilot right alongside you?</p>
<p>Is there at the ready at anytime you want it,</p>
<p>aware of the context in which you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>What if you could get that co-pilot</p>
<p>on the 1.4 billion Windows PCs,</p>
<p>on the most used application on the PC, the browser?</p>
<p>Where you don&rsquo;t have to wonder, Team has created it.</p>
<p>I want to introduce you to your AI</p>
<p>powered co-pilot in Edge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just updated Edge with</p>
<p>a new look and feel and new AI capabilities.</p>
<p>As you can see here, it&rsquo;s sleeker,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s lighter and you&rsquo;re going to notice now that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>integrated Bing in a really cool new way.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Here I am on the Gap website.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m browsing around with my new Edge browser.</p>
<p>I want to read Gap&rsquo;s quarterly report.</p>
<p>I can navigate down to their earnings,</p>
<p>Click on &ldquo;Q3&rdquo;,</p>
<p>and up comes the 15 page Gap PDF. It&rsquo;s pretty long.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t have time to read all that.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d love is a summary of the key points.</p>
<p>I want to show you how now with the power of</p>
<p>Bing&rsquo;s AI capabilities within Edge, we can help.</p>
<p>With one click, I can open up the sidebar.</p>
<p>Now as you can see at the top of the Window,</p>
<p>we have two features, we have chat and compose.</p>
<p>Let me show how chat works.</p>
<p>I can use chat in Edge to simply</p>
<p>ask it to give me the key takeaways of the page I&rsquo;m on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say, key takeaways from the page,</p>
<p>and Bing and AI can now read that PDF and look how</p>
<p>great it comes up</p>
<p>with the summary of the key points here,</p>
<p>their earnings, the fact,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to reaffirm full year guidance.</p>
<p>Very cool, a massive time savings.</p>
<p>But now I want to compare this with say,</p>
<p>Lululemon who also has their third quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Bing can now call out to the web,</p>
<p>pull information from outside of this page,</p>
<p>bring it into Edge,</p>
<p>compare it with the information that&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>this page all within Edge,</p>
<p>and I asked it to it in a table and</p>
<p>look how amazing this is.</p>
<p>Just like that in one table,</p>
<p>I can get an answer this question.</p>
<p>Think about how much time that</p>
<p>would have taken otherwise.</p>
<p>Let me try if we can take it one step further.</p>
<p>A top use case we&rsquo;ve learned from our friends at</p>
<p>OpenAI is that developers are</p>
<p>really being more productive with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Here we are on a Stack Overflow website discussion board</p>
<p>to learn a little bit about programming.</p>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;m researching</p>
<p>tips on how to parse the JSON file.</p>
<p>As we read through,</p>
<p>we find this great little code snippet and I&rsquo;m like, oh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fantastic except it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>Python and we need it in REST.</p>
<p>All we need to do is highlight that text,</p>
<p>have it automatically copied over into the Edge sidebar,</p>
<p>and now, Bing</p>
<p>inside of Edge says, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll say, hey, rewrite this code in REST.</p>
<p>With that simple command,</p>
<p>bin can go and take that code and rewrite</p>
<p>that automatically in the new programming language.</p>
<p>This is amazing. GitHub Copilot</p>
<p>has been a huge boost in developer productivity.</p>
<p>Imagine what the co-pilot can do for</p>
<p>people everywhere on any page.</p>
<p>One final thing to show you.</p>
<p>Not only can you better consume information,</p>
<p>but you can better create.</p>
<p>After our big announcement,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to want to write a LinkedIn post, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just click &ldquo;Create&rdquo; on</p>
<p>the post and up</p>
<p>comes with a creation dialogue and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>But now I can open up the Bing</p>
<p>sidebar and you can see here,</p>
<p>I now will go to compose and I&rsquo;ll just give it a prompt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, hey, introducing</p>
<p>the new AI powered Bing in Edge,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make that enthusiastic and generate</p>
<p>a draft and just lightly to help with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Just like that, you get</p>
<p>a little draft and I can edit it and then with one-click,</p>
<p>it copies right over into my post dialogue,</p>
<p>I can add some hashtags to get it</p>
<p>some juice and just like that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created a post.</p>
<p>All of these amazing new capabilities and</p>
<p>what we think is a revolutionary new experience.</p>
<p>World-class search, the ability to actually get</p>
<p>answers to your questions made easy with integrated chat,</p>
<p>and the ability to generate content when you need it to</p>
<p>spark your imagination brought</p>
<p>to you not only when you&rsquo;re searching,</p>
<p>but everywhere on the web,</p>
<p>courtesy of the new Edge browser.</p>
<p>With your copilot for the web,</p>
<p>we aspire to unlock that joy of discovery,</p>
<p>that wonder of creation,</p>
<p>and that feeling of empowerment and being</p>
<p>able to harness the world&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>
<p>Thank you on that on the presentation.</p>
<p>In a moment,</p>
<p>two of our engineering leaders</p>
<p>are going to come up and unpack a little bit about</p>
<p>the technical details of how we built</p>
<p>the new Bing and our approach to responsible AI.</p>
<p>But before I do, I&rsquo;d like to invite Sam Altman to come up</p>
<p>and share his thoughts on this moment and</p>
<p>our joint work. Welcome, Sam.</p>
<p>SAM ALTMAN: Thank you Yusuf.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be here.</p>
<p>The new Bing experience really</p>
<p>looks fantastic and the depth of</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t come through until you</p>
<p>get to use it. I hope you-all will enjoy.</p>
<p>OpenAI and Microsoft have been working</p>
<p>together for more than three years now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so grateful to have</p>
<p>a partner that shares our vision,</p>
<p>our values of building advanced AI that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>safe and will have a very positive impact on society.</p>
<p>Thanks to our partnership and Azure&rsquo;s AI infrastructure,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been able to make pretty</p>
<p>significant strides in our research,</p>
<p>which has led to the creation of systems like</p>
<p>ChatGPT, Dolly, and Codex.</p>
<p>But we want to make the benefits of AI</p>
<p>available to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve worked with Microsoft to get</p>
<p>this AI technology into the hands of</p>
<p>millions of people through Azure Open AI service,</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot and starting today, Bing.</p>
<p>The new Bing experience is powered by one of</p>
<p>our next-generation models that</p>
<p>Microsoft has customized specifically for search.</p>
<p>It takes key learnings from ChatGPT,</p>
<p>GPT-3.5, and the new model is faster,</p>
<p>more accurate and more capable.</p>
<p>We all search for things many times a day</p>
<p>and Microsoft has created and shipped,</p>
<p>a much better, more useful,</p>
<p>and more enjoyable search experience.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;ve been waiting for this for 20 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy it&rsquo;s here. I believe</p>
<p>that using AI to transform</p>
<p>critical tasks like these is going to greatly</p>
<p>improve our productivity and day-to-day quality of life.</p>
<p>I think this is the beginning of a very new era.</p>
<p>Going forward, we are excited to</p>
<p>continue to collaborate with</p>
<p>Microsoft very far into the future.</p>
<p>The two companies share a deep sense of</p>
<p>responsibility in ensuring that AI gets deployed safely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important to us we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eager to continue learning from</p>
<p>real-world use so they</p>
<p>will create better and better AI systems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to do that in the real-world, not in the lab.</p>
<p>Our teams will continue working together to set standards</p>
<p>for the use of these systems across the entire industry.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, and now I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Dena.</p>
<p>DENA SAUNDERS: Thank you, Sam, Yusuf.</p>
<p>Hello. I&rsquo;m Dina Saunders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the product leader of</p>
<p>the team who brought together the magic</p>
<p>behind being combined with</p>
<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s most powerful model to date.</p>
<p>Yusuf introduced you to Prometheus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to tell you about the technical innovation</p>
<p>behind the experience.</p>
<p>There are five aspects contributing to the new Bing.</p>
<p>The first is a substantial under</p>
<p>the hood change to every layer</p>
<p>of things technological stack.</p>
<p>The second is a proprietary system</p>
<p>called Bing chat orchestration.</p>
<p>The third is state of the art prompt generation.</p>
<p>The fourth is around inference and</p>
<p>a brand new interactive user experience.</p>
<p>Our last development is the infrastructure</p>
<p>to scale for the opportunity ahead.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;ll touch on three of these.</p>
<p>Let me start with Bing chat orchestration.</p>
<p>This is what we use to gather</p>
<p>information needed to answer your question.</p>
<p>The chat orchestrator ingest</p>
<p>your long semantic query and fans out multiple searches.</p>
<p>In fact, you might remember as Yusuf was sharing earlier,</p>
<p>you can actually see in</p>
<p>the user experience the searches that</p>
<p>Bing plus Prometheus is issuing on your behalf.</p>
<p>In addition to searching,</p>
<p>we also inject additional sources of</p>
<p>information to help inform the model.</p>
<p>Let me pause here and say that is incredibly important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually pulling in fresh data, news, answers,</p>
<p>contextual signals such as your location and</p>
<p>the context of the conversation to feed into the model,</p>
<p>to help ground the information</p>
<p>that the model is then using to reason over.</p>
<p>With this fresh information,</p>
<p>some of the experiences that US have showed you earlier,</p>
<p>such as a sports example or inferring on recent events,</p>
<p>those would simply not be possible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more though. This orchestrator in</p>
<p>parallel actually parses the documents</p>
<p>that it finds and identifies</p>
<p>important and relevant pieces of information.</p>
<p>This orchestrator is by nature,</p>
<p>curious and if it comes</p>
<p>across something particularly interesting</p>
<p>or insightful and actually starts that same cycle again.</p>
<p>This virtuous loop results in a package of</p>
<p>information that informs and</p>
<p>fuels the responses you are seeing.</p>
<p>This magic combination of reasoning capabilities with</p>
<p>fresh contextual data sparks</p>
<p>the innovative and groundbreaking combination</p>
<p>that powers the new Bing.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll talk about inference and</p>
<p>the new interactive user experience.</p>
<p>The new interactive experience</p>
<p>seamlessly blends search and chat.</p>
<p>We feed a prompt, ie,</p>
<p>a proprietary set of instructions</p>
<p>into the model which synthesizes</p>
<p>the information reasons over all of the contexts</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve gathered to form an answer to your question.</p>
<p>This overall process is called modal completion.</p>
<p>Think of it like when someone knows you</p>
<p>well enough to complete your sentence.</p>
<p>We run model inferences to generate</p>
<p>tokens ie words which we</p>
<p>stream to you in the user experience</p>
<p>real-time as you saw in Yusuf&rsquo;s examples.</p>
<p>These words combine with sentences</p>
<p>to form the response to your question.</p>
<p>When appropriate, Prometheus</p>
<p>enhances the text answer with</p>
<p>citations to sources and</p>
<p>rich structured answers from Bing.</p>
<p>In users presentation, you saw that</p>
<p>these inferences display in a</p>
<p>brand new, innovative, dual,</p>
<p>interactive user experience that</p>
<p>blends new conversational elements,</p>
<p>a classic search experience,</p>
<p>and a new interactive, immersive chat mode.</p>
<p>The last aspect of our differentiation and</p>
<p>innovation is around the infrastructure we have to scale.</p>
<p>Our differentiation comes really</p>
<p>from taking this innovation that we just shared with</p>
<p>you today and being able to ship</p>
<p>this at scale to millions of users worldwide.</p>
<p>Earlier, I talked about how we touched</p>
<p>every aspect of the tech stack to deliver this.</p>
<p>All of those steps that we just talked about,</p>
<p>those are done in the order of</p>
<p>milliseconds served at the speed of search latency.</p>
<p>When Yusuf was showing you the search page,</p>
<p>you can see near instant search results</p>
<p>juxtaposed on the conversational</p>
<p>insights, all streaming in.</p>
<p>This is possible because we&rsquo;re built on Azure,</p>
<p>the world supercomputer,</p>
<p>the best and most trusted Cloud platform available.</p>
<p>This was a huge effort, incredibly hard.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, teams were working on powering and</p>
<p>building out machines in data centers worldwide.</p>
<p>We were carefully orchestrating and configuring</p>
<p>a complex set of distributed resources.</p>
<p>We built new platform pieces</p>
<p>designed to help load balance,</p>
<p>optimize performance and scale like never before.</p>
<p>There is no other company that can</p>
<p>do this like Microsoft and Bing.</p>
<p>As we roll out the product globally,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting out small, focused on</p>
<p>learning and evolving with the help of your feedback.</p>
<p>We understand that with this major technological shift,</p>
<p>there will be new challenges along the way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re committed to learning with you.</p>
<p>On behalf of the team, we&rsquo;re delighted to</p>
<p>share this moment with you and with that,</p>
<p>let me introduce you to Sarah,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of Microsoft&rsquo;s renowned responsible AI experts.</p>
<p>SARAH BIRD: Hi, I&rsquo;m Sarah Bird.</p>
<p>I lead our Responsible AI engineering team for</p>
<p>new foundational AI technologies</p>
<p>like the Prometheus Model.</p>
<p>I was one of the first people to touch</p>
<p>the new OpenAI model as part of</p>
<p>an advanced red team that we pulled together jointly</p>
<p>with OpenAI to understand the technology.</p>
<p>My first reaction was just, wow,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most exciting and powerful technology</p>
<p>I have ever touched.</p>
<p>But with the technology this powerful,</p>
<p>I also know that we have</p>
<p>an even greater responsibility</p>
<p>to ensure that it is developed,</p>
<p>deployed, and used properly.</p>
<p>Which means there&rsquo;s a lot that we have</p>
<p>to do to make it ready for users.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at Microsoft,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>We have been preparing for this moment for many years.</p>
<p>Since 2017, we have been investing in</p>
<p>a cross company program to ensure that</p>
<p>our AI systems are responsible by design,</p>
<p>which has pushed us to innovate across</p>
<p>our entire portfolio of</p>
<p>products to solve Responsible AI challenges.</p>
<p>Through that we have created a foundation of</p>
<p>Responsible AI product implementation patterns</p>
<p>that we can build on top of.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also not new to</p>
<p>working with generative AI technologies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been using early versions in Office and Bing</p>
<p>for spell checking and grammar rewriting for years.</p>
<p>Obviously, lately, it&rsquo;s only getting more exciting.</p>
<p>In the past year, we launched the GitHub Copilot GA,</p>
<p>based on the codecs co-generation model,</p>
<p>the Bing creator powered by</p>
<p>the DALL-E image generation model,</p>
<p>and our own Florence multi-modal model.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of generative AI.</p>
<p>With each one, we have learned more about</p>
<p>the risks that generative AI technologies can bring,</p>
<p>including well-known ones like</p>
<p>the perpetuation of stereotypes and bias,</p>
<p>as well as novel risks such as</p>
<p>jail breaks and we</p>
<p>have developed mitigations to address them.</p>
<p>In developing the new Bing,</p>
<p>we are building on our years of operating</p>
<p>large-scale consumer and enterprise services</p>
<p>and our deep partnership with OpenAI.</p>
<p>However, for this product,</p>
<p>we went further than we&rsquo;ve ever gone before.</p>
<p>We have marshaled the full strength</p>
<p>of our Responsible AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>Scientists, researchers, ethicist, engineers,</p>
<p>and legal and policy experts to work together as</p>
<p>a single team to develop</p>
<p>approaches to measurement and risk mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added Responsible AI to every layer,</p>
<p>from the core AI model to the user experience.</p>
<p>First, starting with the base technology,</p>
<p>we are partnering with OpenAI to</p>
<p>improve the model behavior through fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;ve built a state-of-the-art safety system.</p>
<p>Bing has been maturing its defensive technologies</p>
<p>over many years of operating a web scale search engine.</p>
<p>These include AI systems that understand user queries and</p>
<p>classified documents to ensure</p>
<p>safe and quality results for users.</p>
<p>We have combined these with newer AI technologies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve created in Azure</p>
<p>to moderate generative models.</p>
<p>We are continuously retraining all of</p>
<p>these safety models by mining anonymous Bing query logs,</p>
<p>and using the new OpenAI model to</p>
<p>generate thousands of example conversations.</p>
<p>We can update our defenses in minutes to</p>
<p>respond to gaps we find or changes in the world.</p>
<p>The result is a safety system that enables us</p>
<p>to act and understand data at</p>
<p>every level of the application so we can defend against</p>
<p>intentional misuse and mistakes from the AI.</p>
<p>Finally, at the application layer,</p>
<p>we are iterating on instructions as part of</p>
<p>the meta-prompt to guide</p>
<p>the model to produce great responses.</p>
<p>We have designed the user experience to ensure</p>
<p>users understand and are in control.</p>
<p>How do we know all of this works?</p>
<p>Measuring responsible harms is</p>
<p>a challenging new area of research.</p>
<p>This is where we really needed to innovate.</p>
<p>We had a key idea that we could actually use</p>
<p>the new OpenAI model as a Responsible AI tool to</p>
<p>help us test for</p>
<p>potential risk and we</p>
<p>developed a new testing system based on this idea.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a tech planning</p>
<p>as an example of how this works.</p>
<p>Early red teaming showed that the model can generate</p>
<p>much more sophisticated instructions than</p>
<p>earlier versions of the technology</p>
<p>to help someone plan an attack,</p>
<p>for example on a school.</p>
<p>Obviously, we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>aid illegal activities in the new Bing.</p>
<p>However, the fact that</p>
<p>the model understands these activities</p>
<p>means we can use it to identify and defend against them.</p>
<p>First, we took advantage</p>
<p>of the model&rsquo;s ability to conduct</p>
<p>realistic conversations</p>
<p>to develop a conversation simulator.</p>
<p>The model pretends to be</p>
<p>an adversarial user to conduct thousands of</p>
<p>different potentially harmful conversations</p>
<p>with Bing to see how it reacts.</p>
<p>As a result, we&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>continuously test our system on</p>
<p>a wide range of conversations</p>
<p>before any real user ever touches it.</p>
<p>Once we have the conversations,</p>
<p>the next step is to analyze them,</p>
<p>to see where Bing is doing</p>
<p>the right thing versus where we have defects.</p>
<p>Conversations are difficult for most AI to</p>
<p>classify because they&rsquo;re multi turn</p>
<p>and often more varied.</p>
<p>But with the new model,</p>
<p>we were able to push the boundary of what is possible.</p>
<p>We took guidelines that are typically</p>
<p>used by expert linguists to label</p>
<p>data and modified them so</p>
<p>the model could understand them as labeling instructions.</p>
<p>We iterated it with it and</p>
<p>the human experts until there was</p>
<p>significant agreement in their labels.</p>
<p>We then used it to classify</p>
<p>conversations automatically so we could</p>
<p>understand the gaps in our system</p>
<p>and experiment with options to improve them.</p>
<p>This system enables us to create a tight loop of testing,</p>
<p>analyzing, and improving,</p>
<p>which has led to significant new innovations</p>
<p>and improvements in</p>
<p>our Responsible AI mitigations from</p>
<p>our initial implementation to where we are today.</p>
<p>The same system enables us to test</p>
<p>many different Responsible AI risk,</p>
<p>for example, how accurate and fresh the information is.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s still more to do here today</p>
<p>and we do see places where the model is making mistakes.</p>
<p>We wanted to empower users to understand</p>
<p>the sources of any information</p>
<p>and detect errors themselves,</p>
<p>which is why we have provided</p>
<p>references in the interface.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also added feedback features</p>
<p>so that users can point</p>
<p>out issues they find so that we can get better over time.</p>
<p>Maturing and new technology takes time and collaboration,</p>
<p>which is why we&rsquo;re very excited for</p>
<p>this next phase where we can</p>
<p>share the technology with the real-world.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing users unlock</p>
<p>its full potential and getting feedback from</p>
<p>stakeholders across society to help</p>
<p>develop this into an essential tool for the future.</p>
<p>Our goal is to continuously advance the state of the art.</p>
<p>Yusuf, back to you.</p>
<p>YUSUF MEHDI: Thank you, Sarah. To close,</p>
<p>we have one final piece of news to share.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the new Bing is live</p>
<p>today for desktop limited preview.</p>
<p>What this means is that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>make Bing available today for</p>
<p>everyone to try on a limited number of queries</p>
<p>and then to sign up on the wait list to</p>
<p>get access to the full experience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also starting with a select group of folks</p>
<p>who will have access to the full experience right away.</p>
<p>All of you here in the room,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all going to be on that list so you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>going to get to try it right away.</p>
<p>In addition then we plan to expand</p>
<p>to millions of people in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We are also going to be launching our mobile version.</p>
<p>Today is an important part of our journey.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just the beginning. As Sarah said,</p>
<p>we intend to innovate quickly,</p>
<p>get your feedback, and continue to bring</p>
<p>new innovations and capabilities to everyone.</p>
<p>Welcome to the new Bing and Edge.</p>
<p>Thanks very much, thanks for being here.</p>
