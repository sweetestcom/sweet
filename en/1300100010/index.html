<p>so that&rsquo;s all for you are rapping out the whole team</p>
<p>fuck around make you a model i make you famous</p>
<p>turn around and make you famous cause you</p>
<p>never understood how vital to me this rap game is</p>
<p>say they can hold that you catch a hot one</p>
<p>try to chase a fake nigga down soon as i spot one clip</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m nice like that like that</p>
<p>song in this business around</p>
<p>hmm</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>but i got no video just wack as shit</p>
<p>it just it never ends i can&rsquo;t get it right</p>
<p>you can hear me but you can&rsquo;t see me</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>i do not know</p>
<p>how the fuck this program works that&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to get me on i don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s not showing try this</p>
<p>hey we got it we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m playing gangstar</p>
<p>out of respect</p>
<p>for guru from gangstar had a</p>
<p>heart attack this week went into a coma</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in like some sort of a</p>
<p>medically induced coma</p>
<p>some dude said it best</p>
<p>on twitter said that&rsquo;s when you know you&rsquo;re getting old</p>
<p>when hip hop</p>
<p>stars start having fucking</p>
<p>heart attacks</p>
<p>man he&rsquo;s 43</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s only a year</p>
<p>older than me</p>
<p>william do ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all dying slowly</p>
<p>not this motherfucker look at this dude</p>
<p>from national geographic geographic magazine</p>
<p>i just picked this up i don&rsquo;t even know the story</p>
<p>but i just had to pick it up because it&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about polygamy it says polygamy in america</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one dude who&rsquo;s got five wives</p>
<p>and forty six children</p>
<p>now my only problem with any of this shit is</p>
<p>these creepy fucks are always</p>
<p>marrying sixteen year olds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i don&rsquo;t tell you about it</p>
<p>and when you go into the article that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a big a big</p>
<p>point here that a couple of</p>
<p>these guys have been arrested like this fucking freak</p>
<p>tell me that guy you can&rsquo;t even see but</p>
<p>that looks like somebody she just arrest</p>
<p>he was apparently</p>
<p>married to some sixteen year old who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he sent them to ten years in prison for sexual assault</p>
<p>this is the only problem these creepy fucks</p>
<p>with this this crazy</p>
<p>five wives shit</p>
<p>the only way you get chicks to</p>
<p>agree to that is</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re drugged up retarded or really really young</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>these guys pull this shit off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not fair</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying i mean if you&rsquo;re pulling it off</p>
<p>total pimp style</p>
<p>i give you just some</p>
<p>hugh hefner type character</p>
<p>that like lays down the lawns like listen i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a bunch of</p>
<p>chicks and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like getting when they&rsquo;re really young and</p>
<p>brainwashing them</p>
<p>so it really is like a cult</p>
<p>because believe me</p>
<p>chicks don&rsquo;t want that shit but hey</p>
<p>if you could pull it off when you&rsquo;re an adult</p>
<p>whatever i&rsquo;m not a hater</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m all for it if you can pull it off as an adult</p>
<p>but like i said with these creepy fucks these</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>what this dude&rsquo;s thing is called</p>
<p>i guess it&rsquo;s a mormon splinter group</p>
<p>no whatever</p>
<p>no one has any fucking answers any</p>
<p>ideology that you follow is</p>
<p>gonna be full of shit any one of them all of them</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely open unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not one single person that&rsquo;s laying down rules</p>
<p>not one single person that&rsquo;s telling you what to do</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s just a gigantic</p>
<p>group of people that are all</p>
<p>really like minded open minded and thinking</p>
<p>about things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the number one problem with democracy is that</p>
<p>fucking anybody can vote and</p>
<p>you can easily like get people to</p>
<p>think the way you&rsquo;re thinking it&rsquo;s not that difficult</p>
<p>most people have</p>
<p>no idea how to think</p>
<p>and on top of that they have</p>
<p>to fucking work and they have a family and they have</p>
<p>obligations they have debt they have problems</p>
<p>and they try to get laid there&rsquo;s a lot of shit going on</p>
<p>so for them to be paying attention to</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>going on with the national deficit and all that crap</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna happen man it&rsquo;s too much to</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>even the fucking people that work in finance don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand finance</p>
<p>if they did have it how did that bernie made off</p>
<p>thing ever get off</p>
<p>how did that guy ever pull that shit off</p>
<p>he pulled that shit off because</p>
<p>no one understands the</p>
<p>system it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that system is just fucking</p>
<p>buccaneers those guys are just pirates</p>
<p>stealing money left and right</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how our</p>
<p>world works</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>so since i did this podcast last</p>
<p>killer whale</p>
<p>killed this trainer</p>
<p>and you saw</p>
<p>people follow me on twitter i posted a lot of shit</p>
<p>about that on twitter</p>
<p>because i thought it was completely fucking ridiculous</p>
<p>that they first of all</p>
<p>they take these animals that are</p>
<p>super intelligent and they cage them</p>
<p>you know the way this whale was raised this whale in</p>
<p>particular was raised in canada</p>
<p>and the place where they had him</p>
<p>would they would give him</p>
<p>this little tiny cell</p>
<p>to share with</p>
<p>these other whales at</p>
<p>night so they would like</p>
<p>stuff them into this</p>
<p>thing where they literally couldn&rsquo;t turn</p>
<p>around they couldn&rsquo;t move they couldn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>and if he didn&rsquo;t go into his cage</p>
<p>and if he didn&rsquo;t do his</p>
<p>tricks they would</p>
<p>they would deprive him of food</p>
<p>up to 25 to 30 percent of his</p>
<p>daily food intake they</p>
<p>would just cut it back from him</p>
<p>so this poor animal</p>
<p>was who was</p>
<p>as intelligent as us</p>
<p>was forced to star forced to do</p>
<p>tricks to get his food and forced to willingly</p>
<p>enter into a cage in</p>
<p>order to get his food</p>
<p>so this is a fucking</p>
<p>angry animal</p>
<p>now on top of that they don&rsquo;t really let him breed</p>
<p>they excite him</p>
<p>and then they extract</p>
<p>sperm from them like they</p>
<p>basically jerk them off</p>
<p>you know and they sell his</p>
<p>sperm because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth a lot of money</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>breed whales and captivity because people find it very</p>
<p>distasteful when you go and capture killer whales now</p>
<p>because we know how</p>
<p>smart they are</p>
<p>we know how tied they are to</p>
<p>their family</p>
<p>this whale was</p>
<p>stolen from his family when he was two years old</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposedly as close to</p>
<p>human beings as you can get but being totally</p>
<p>alien from us</p>
<p>i mean they don&rsquo;t alter</p>
<p>their environment they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know they can&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>their surroundings</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have you know anything they</p>
<p>could pick shit up</p>
<p>but they have</p>
<p>dialects they have different sounds</p>
<p>for different packs of</p>
<p>whales so they</p>
<p>understand each other and</p>
<p>different pods of</p>
<p>whales so they</p>
<p>understand each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s dialect they mate</p>
<p>they they stay together like they stay with</p>
<p>their family like for life like this</p>
<p>whale would have been with his mom for life</p>
<p>and they just fucking</p>
<p>snatched him out of the</p>
<p>water when he was two years old</p>
<p>and the whole</p>
<p>thing is so creepy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically slavery</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s slavery but we</p>
<p>allow it because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand them</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really what it is i mean</p>
<p>those fucking animals are</p>
<p>super intelligent</p>
<p>you know i read that</p>
<p>their cerebral</p>
<p>cortex is 40</p>
<p>larger than ours</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re lacking some</p>
<p>things that we have</p>
<p>and they have you know more of</p>
<p>other things that we have</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>clear is that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super intelligent</p>
<p>their intelligence is so difficult to</p>
<p>understand though because it&rsquo;s so alien</p>
<p>because their</p>
<p>world is so</p>
<p>alien i mean they live</p>
<p>they are they&rsquo;re out there just with</p>
<p>their mouths</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re super intelligent</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>with their with</p>
<p>their fucking face</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re not like removed from it like us</p>
<p>where you go to the</p>
<p>supermarket and you pick up a steak</p>
<p>they are as intelligent</p>
<p>as supposedly as</p>
<p>humans and that</p>
<p>they kill with</p>
<p>their own head</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s a totally different mindset</p>
<p>totally different</p>
<p>world they live in</p>
<p>they have to kill sharks</p>
<p>because sharks</p>
<p>will occasionally you know attack</p>
<p>their pups and</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>just just dangerous they don&rsquo;t like having</p>
<p>sharks around</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a killer</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a killer</p>
<p>video there&rsquo;s a cool</p>
<p>video online of a killer</p>
<p>whale killing a</p>
<p>great white</p>
<p>shark you know</p>
<p>they they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never killed a single</p>
<p>human being in the wild ever</p>
<p>they they only kill</p>
<p>human beings in captivity</p>
<p>why because</p>
<p>those fucking</p>
<p>human beings are like prison</p>
<p>guards man those are</p>
<p>slave masters</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>us taking someone and putting them in jail if we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand their language it&rsquo;s really no different</p>
<p>you know i think that</p>
<p>with killer</p>
<p>whales are probably definitely</p>
<p>smarter than some people i mean</p>
<p>think like the dumbest fucking people that you know</p>
<p>i bet killer</p>
<p>whales are probably</p>
<p>smarter than</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>i bet if you had like a killer whale</p>
<p>had like a contest like</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>a you know mental aptitude</p>
<p>contest with</p>
<p>a real meathead</p>
<p>i bet the killer</p>
<p>whale would win you know for sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucked up man we don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever get our shit together that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what really</p>
<p>drives me nuts it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>human beings for whatever reason</p>
<p>are exactly as</p>
<p>we have always been we just don&rsquo;t get our shit together</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the fuck our problem is</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like we&rsquo;re ever working anything out</p>
<p>just the same shit over and over and over and over</p>
<p>again so my friends on twitter</p>
<p>was cracking i will now go to the</p>
<p>twitter a little chat thing</p>
<p>try to get some questions if this</p>
<p>browser doesn&rsquo;t crash</p>
<p>now the way i&rsquo;m doing it i&rsquo;m gonna browse</p>
<p>with firefox and i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>stream the show with safari like you give a fuck</p>
<p>so i guess they just signed james tony to the ufc</p>
<p>i guess that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome man</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s true i</p>
<p>wanna see it i wanna see some freak shows</p>
<p>i wanna see</p>
<p>i wanna see</p>
<p>i would love to see james tony</p>
<p>versus someone good you know some good a good grappler</p>
<p>or not even man</p>
<p>maybe someone who&rsquo;s good will</p>
<p>stand up with him a little bit</p>
<p>maybe a good like you know what i would love to see</p>
<p>james tony versus pat barry</p>
<p>you know james tony with those four ounce gloves</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t realize how good that guy&rsquo;s hands are he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna show people a whole different level</p>
<p>if someone will stand with them but that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>somebody doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>stand with them just gonna take his ass down at will</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna kick his legs out from under him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be the biggest shock</p>
<p>i just wonder who he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>train with i wonder if he&rsquo;s gonna really train</p>
<p>with kickboxers</p>
<p>and with jiu jitsu guys and if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take leg kicks and learn how to check kicks</p>
<p>or side check kicks as he calls it</p>
<p>no who knows man</p>
<p>who the fuck knows</p>
<p>i guess he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>heavyweight i don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna lose weight</p>
<p>i mean he he is a boxing heavyweight champion</p>
<p>i mean he destroyed the holy field that heavyweight</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>psyched for that man i think that&rsquo;s gonna be fun</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s gonna be interesting</p>
<p>but like i said i want to see jose canseco versus</p>
<p>herschel walker i&rsquo;m a freak</p>
<p>i want to see the freak shows</p>
<p>my twitter people</p>
<p>my my friends</p>
<p>get some of these</p>
<p>christian group wants killer whale</p>
<p>stone to death is that true that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>you might have just made that shit up you fuck</p>
<p>jerry vet i don&rsquo;t know is that true</p>
<p>james tony versus hershel walker</p>
<p>no man i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a good move</p>
<p>i think that would be a little dangerous</p>
<p>i think kersel needs a few more</p>
<p>fights before</p>
<p>he steps in there the guy who can bang like james tony</p>
<p>unless her she&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>really good takedown defense</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really good takedowns rather</p>
<p>very possible</p>
<p>some of these questions</p>
<p>are really terrible</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s strongest man to</p>
<p>fight in ufc that pujinowski guy i think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about pujinowski fighting james tony</p>
<p>which i think is very interesting</p>
<p>cause not james tony excuse me they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about pujanowski fighting tim sylvia</p>
<p>which i think is very interesting because</p>
<p>kwijanowski is super strong and everything and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a beast of a man but goddamn i mean how much are people</p>
<p>people selling tim sylvia short</p>
<p>yeah ray mercer knocked him out with a big</p>
<p>punch but guess what ray mercer</p>
<p>would knock out almost anybody with that fucking</p>
<p>punch ray mercer hits you in the jaw like that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of people that i</p>
<p>could imagine outside of mark hunt in his prime</p>
<p>taking that punch on the chin you know</p>
<p>i think people are selling</p>
<p>people are selling tim sylvia very short</p>
<p>dude&rsquo;s good man he&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>this guy says</p>
<p>james tony isn&rsquo;t dedicated to anything but food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true sir how dare you</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t be because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get that good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to get that good and and not be</p>
<p>training all the time it&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>for sure he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know for sure he&rsquo;s got killer boxing technique</p>
<p>is his ability to</p>
<p>shoulder roll</p>
<p>punches and ability to block punches and encounter</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s one of those dudes you can stay</p>
<p>right outside and just like counters</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in seeing what happens when a guy like that</p>
<p>punches somebody with</p>
<p>those little gloves on</p>
<p>and who knows i mean he</p>
<p>might break his fucking hands when that&rsquo;s possible too</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s had hand problems in the past but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m curious to see like</p>
<p>i wonder what</p>
<p>would happen with a guy like</p>
<p>fully mayweather who has had hand problems</p>
<p>those little gloves</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t offer that much</p>
<p>protection and if you</p>
<p>catch a guy on the</p>
<p>elbow or you</p>
<p>catch a guy like top</p>
<p>of his head or something like that or you just hit him</p>
<p>hit him the</p>
<p>wrong way you can</p>
<p>break your hand very very possible</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s interesting man i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>you know all</p>
<p>these crazy fights</p>
<p>the herschel</p>
<p>walker thing with jose canseco</p>
<p>this james tony</p>
<p>thing all these</p>
<p>crazy fights</p>
<p>what they do is they get more people</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>mixed martial arts and the more people</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>the more they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>watch the real</p>
<p>fighters not</p>
<p>these guys not real</p>
<p>fighters but</p>
<p>the real high</p>
<p>level fighters</p>
<p>you know the machitas and the anderson silvas and</p>
<p>and came alaska as</p>
<p>those kind of guys so i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s all good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all good</p>
<p>coming to canada this week you</p>
<p>dirty bitches</p>

<p>move to texas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you want to be if al qaeda attacks america</p>
<p>too al qaeda is like a hundred al qaeda right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the crazy things they said</p>
<p>about afghanistan</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a hundred taliban in afghanistan</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s filled with lies</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand any of it neither do you</p>
<p>why are we playing games</p>
<p>why do we pretend that we</p>
<p>understand the news and with</p>
<p>all the bullshit</p>
<p>the government feeds us to even pretend that</p>
<p>we know exactly what&rsquo;s happening overseas is</p>
<p>laughable that shit&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way you can know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in afghanistan</p>
<p>when i hear people arguing</p>
<p>you know well</p>
<p>you knew what man the taliban</p>
<p>right now and the position that allocate is in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s imperative</p>
<p>that we what are you even fucking talking about dude</p>
<p>i know that you have a kid</p>
<p>i know that you&rsquo;re a fucking accountant</p>
<p>i know that you play softball</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of time that you just ate up</p>
<p>where is the time to going</p>
<p>to afghanistan and really</p>
<p>finding out what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on with the taliban</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not happening</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re just talking out of your ass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re reading talking points</p>
<p>based on you know the various</p>
<p>right wing or left wing websites or</p>
<p>right wing or left wing</p>
<p>television shows they&rsquo;re picking a side</p>
<p>and they just fucking get on it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem with</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>we you know all this nutty shit happens in the</p>
<p>world and one of the reasons why we allow</p>
<p>nutty shit to happen is because we get on a team and</p>
<p>and we get our team and we pick it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why so few democrats are complaining</p>
<p>about obama</p>
<p>democrats should be</p>
<p>going fucking bonkers just like everybody else is</p>
<p>going bonkers</p>
<p>cause obama&rsquo;s proven</p>
<p>to be no no different than any of the rest of them</p>
<p>but democrats</p>
<p>there they&rsquo;re not saying any</p>
<p>crazy shit about</p>
<p>obama because</p>
<p>obama is on their team</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>people look at shit that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so fucked up</p>
<p>you know i mean this guy he sends</p>
<p>he gets the nobel</p>
<p>peace prize and then sends 30 000</p>
<p>troops to afghanistan</p>
<p>could you imagine how democrats</p>
<p>would react if</p>
<p>a republican did that</p>
<p>they would go fucking crazy</p>
<p>meanwhile with</p>
<p>obama they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>no they don&rsquo;t want to say anything</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s really the perfect way</p>
<p>to get if the republicans were</p>
<p>genius i mean</p>
<p>if the big cabal conspiracy is true if</p>
<p>there are billionaire bankers that totally control the</p>
<p>world what a</p>
<p>genius way to control</p>
<p>everything you get a</p>
<p>black liberal</p>
<p>and you have him do exactly the same</p>
<p>thing that republicans do</p>
<p>get a black</p>
<p>liberal a guy who supposedly</p>
<p>liberal but yet is</p>
<p>sending mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>liberal in the way he</p>
<p>spends tax dollars this</p>
<p>fucking all this</p>
<p>crazy shit with the bailout that</p>
<p>the fact that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not accountable for this</p>
<p>money we can&rsquo;t exactly figure out</p>
<p>where it all went</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t loosened lending at all</p>
<p>that was a whole idea</p>
<p>about this it was supposed to</p>
<p>stimulate the economy and make</p>
<p>that money more accessible but they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>loaned less</p>
<p>money than ever before</p>
<p>i mean the whole</p>
<p>thing is it just reeks of crime</p>
<p>it reeks of corruption</p>
<p>and opportunism</p>
<p>yet you know how many democrats are talking</p>
<p>about it very</p>
<p>few the reason why is because he&rsquo;s on their team</p>
<p>it makes no sense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a guy on a football team</p>
<p>throwing the fucking ball the</p>
<p>wrong way and the crowd is</p>
<p>still cheering</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s like or the</p>
<p>crowds not saying anything</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretending they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we love to be on fucking teams it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>worst things</p>
<p>about human beings</p>
<p>and one of the scariest teams</p>
<p>right now is team stupid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even team republican</p>
<p>team stupid jumps on team</p>
<p>republican because team republican</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t talk down to them</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>thing works so well</p>
<p>the reason why</p>
<p>sarah palin works so well is not because all</p>
<p>these people believe with her</p>
<p>ideas and they</p>
<p>agree with her ideas and</p>
<p>agree with her on the issues</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even know how she</p>
<p>stands on the issues</p>
<p>one of the scariest</p>
<p>videos i ever saw in line was this dude at a</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>book signing</p>
<p>these motherfuckers were in line for</p>
<p>hours it was like</p>
<p>zero degrees outside</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in inline for</p>
<p>hours waiting</p>
<p>to talk to sarah palin</p>
<p>talking about how she</p>
<p>should be president</p>
<p>and about you know they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>bringing back to</p>
<p>basic values and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go back to the way america</p>
<p>should be and</p>
<p>all that talk is just</p>
<p>stupid talk</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they are what they&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>she seems like me i am dumb</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck is happening i&rsquo;m terrified</p>
<p>i believe in</p>
<p>fairy tales</p>
<p>i believe in dumb nonsense that&rsquo;s easily disproven</p>
<p>and i like her</p>
<p>cause she does too</p>
<p>they like the fact that</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>believes that</p>
<p>evolution is bullshit</p>
<p>and that the</p>
<p>earth is only 10 000 years old she believes that</p>
<p>she said that to a fucking</p>
<p>teacher in alaska</p>
<p>she had a conversation with them</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>long before she ever ran for president</p>
<p>or vice president rather</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they like they look stupid</p>
<p>people love</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>they love someone</p>
<p>that makes them feel like they&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>if you use a windows computer</p>
<p>you love other people</p>
<p>that use windows you use windows too yeah windows rules</p>
<p>max are for fags</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other way if you&rsquo;re a mac head you look at</p>
<p>those idiots in</p>
<p>their fucking windows</p>
<p>people love</p>
<p>to be on the same team whether it&rsquo;s republican</p>
<p>or democrat or</p>
<p>smart or stupid</p>
<p>how many dumb people have you ever met that are on team</p>
<p>smart a lot right</p>
<p>there are a</p>
<p>lot of dumb people that try to pretend to be smart</p>
<p>and then you talk to him</p>
<p>about things and they just have like</p>
<p>these talking</p>
<p>points that they can repeat but</p>
<p>they really have just</p>
<p>adopted a conglomeration of</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s opinions they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really thought anything out</p>
<p>and when you challenge them on the very ideas</p>
<p>for these opinions that</p>
<p>are organizing and governing</p>
<p>their entire lives</p>
<p>they really have nothing to say</p>
<p>about it because they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really thought</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart person</p>
<p>than according to most people that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s on team</p>
<p>smart but he&rsquo;s really a dumb god</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very common</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just taking advantage of the whole team thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the fuck is going on with obama</p>
<p>we got a we got a guys pretending</p>
<p>to be on you know one team and doing exactly the same</p>
<p>thing that the other team would do</p>
<p>this guy says</p>
<p>dustin hunter says i didn&rsquo;t used to hate mccain</p>
<p>until he brought palin into the picture i think</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a repellent</p>
<p>should show any all of us all of us is that</p>
<p>it will clearly she&rsquo;s not qualified to run the</p>
<p>world there&rsquo;s no way no but nobody believes that</p>
<p>but what that shows you is that</p>
<p>the position of president really is</p>
<p>just horseshit</p>
<p>you know they really are just a</p>
<p>spokesperson</p>
<p>you know you get into that position you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>spokesperson for</p>
<p>big business it&rsquo;s no more than being a star of a sitcom</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re not writing the sitcom you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the star of the sitcom you&rsquo;re the guy that they choose</p>
<p>to play the fat postal</p>
<p>worker or whatever</p>
<p>the fuck you are the bartender whatever you want</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re the the</p>
<p>black liberal you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the white</p>
<p>rancher i mean</p>
<p>george bush even went so far as to buy a fucking</p>
<p>ranch in texas</p>
<p>you know i mean that kind of</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s from fucking maine you know</p>
<p>they just played this part of like the texas</p>
<p>down home he&rsquo;s out in memory used to be on the</p>
<p>ranch like sawing</p>
<p>wood and shit like the fuck are you doing man</p>
<p>sawing wood</p>
<p>you know supposed to</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re on my side now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re playing a part</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on so</p>
<p>mccain i mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s no different than all the rest of them you know</p>
<p>if you were really a maverick</p>
<p>you never get to that position</p>
<p>the guys like ron paul</p>
<p>the guys that</p>
<p>stand up and</p>
<p>i mean ron paul just</p>
<p>gave back a hundred thousand dollars to the treasury</p>
<p>from his i guess from</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know exactly what the details of it</p>
<p>i have to read it</p>
<p>sounds real good good talking point</p>
<p>but ron paul is like he&rsquo;s like this old dude that wears</p>
<p>sneakers you know he wears</p>
<p>suits with sneakers on you know why because he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care they&rsquo;re black</p>
<p>that so they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>leather and</p>
<p>the bottoms rubber the more comfortable than fucking</p>
<p>stupid shoes with</p>
<p>slippery souls</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind</p>
<p>of duty is he&rsquo;s just don&rsquo;t give a fuck dude and</p>
<p>those dudes don&rsquo;t get to be president</p>
<p>those dudes just get to talk a lot</p>
<p>and somewhere</p>
<p>someone along the line</p>
<p>figures out</p>
<p>some way to discredit him make him look nutty</p>
<p>you know you remember when he was a</p>
<p>talking when all the people were talking</p>
<p>about presidential</p>
<p>candidates back in two thousand and</p>
<p>eight you know</p>
<p>ron paul they were they were joking</p>
<p>about them laughing</p>
<p>about left and</p>
<p>right meanwhile</p>
<p>everything he said came true</p>
<p>when he was talking</p>
<p>about the economic collapse and he was talking</p>
<p>about i mean</p>
<p>everything that he said</p>
<p>about the bailout</p>
<p>everything he said</p>
<p>about where the</p>
<p>money was gonna go he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>right about</p>
<p>all this shit and they</p>
<p>still make it</p>
<p>make it seem like he&rsquo;s a nut</p>
<p>and you know somehow another managed to connect him to</p>
<p>9 11 truthers and</p>
<p>you know fucking david i</p>
<p>rep reptilian conspiracy theories</p>
<p>like all these fucking nutty people</p>
<p>they somehow another</p>
<p>wound up connecting them all together</p>
<p>to somehow another discredit anything that might be</p>
<p>a little bit controversial or weird</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that people like to do they love to</p>
<p>love to box</p>
<p>shit up nice and tidy you know</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re saying some</p>
<p>things that are uncomfortable for people to hear</p>
<p>they just stick you with some 9 11</p>
<p>truthers or something along</p>
<p>those lines</p>
<p>just shut you right the fuck up you know</p>
<p>ron paul apparently doesn&rsquo;t believe in evolution though</p>
<p>which is very interesting</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you know whether or not you</p>
<p>believe that there&rsquo;s a god or whether or not i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think the</p>
<p>the two i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re mutually exclusive i think that</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>evolution is like the idea that everything</p>
<p>becomes more and more complex as time goes on</p>
<p>and we could see that the evidence of that we</p>
<p>could see that in our own lives</p>
<p>we could see that in our own culture</p>
<p>tried watching like a tv show from 1950 and</p>
<p>they were so fucking dumb</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so dumb it&rsquo;s like staggering they&rsquo;re like a comedy now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re a parody</p>
<p>you know if you</p>
<p>watch like father knows best or something</p>
<p>like that i mean it really is almost like a parody</p>
<p>and the reason being because people</p>
<p>did not have as much access to information back then</p>
<p>they were more naive</p>
<p>our culture was less evolved</p>
<p>if you look at the</p>
<p>music from 1930</p>
<p>and then look at the</p>
<p>music here in</p>
<p>2010 it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>clear that things are</p>
<p>becoming more and more complex</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re evolving</p>
<p>sure there&rsquo;s some dumb shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stuffed in there too and there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be dumb shit you need to feed the</p>
<p>dummies but</p>
<p>on the most part</p>
<p>like rock music and more complex</p>
<p>music it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it sounds different the</p>
<p>production quality is far better</p>
<p>you know what they can do with music and</p>
<p>sound is far better</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s evolving</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s becoming more complex just like all organisms are</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>place in the congo</p>
<p>where the congo&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>the way it is</p>
<p>right now the rainforest</p>
<p>has only been like that for a couple thousand years</p>
<p>two thousand years ago what it was it was</p>
<p>grasslands but the</p>
<p>grasslands because the climate change</p>
<p>became this rainforest</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of like</p>
<p>plains animals that are</p>
<p>stuck inside this</p>
<p>this incredibly</p>
<p>dense jungle</p>
<p>and one of them is this little antelope</p>
<p>and this little antelope i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called a diker</p>
<p>it swims underwater</p>
<p>and it eats fish</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>fucking antelope family it&rsquo;s this little tiny</p>
<p>short legged antelope</p>
<p>it swims underwater and eats fish</p>
<p>i mean if that&rsquo;s not something fucking</p>
<p>adapting and</p>
<p>surviving and this</p>
<p>is over the course of just a couple of thousand years</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fish</p>
<p>in the congo that</p>
<p>climbs out of the</p>
<p>water and walks</p>
<p>to the next</p>
<p>water hole and</p>
<p>then dives in i mean what the fuck is that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>evolving you know</p>
<p>this is evolution that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>occurring in this little</p>
<p>small area over a very</p>
<p>short period of time</p>
<p>i mean the idea that this fucking antelope</p>
<p>developed to swim</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>water there and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rivers and all this shit and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a way to get more food</p>
<p>they swim underwater</p>
<p>and they eat fish i mean it&rsquo;s fucking craziness</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve developed ability to to hunt</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s an antelope</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s pretty crazy</p>
<p>stuff that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no god</p>
<p>it just means there&rsquo;s some other shit going on</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>some one all</p>
<p>powerful thing at the end of it</p>
<p>the idea though that that one all powerful</p>
<p>thing at the end of it looks like us and talks english</p>
<p>and you know is</p>
<p>you know it wants you</p>
<p>to follow his way or you burn in hell all that fucking</p>
<p>kookiness that&rsquo;s obviously people fucking with the idea</p>
<p>but i think the idea that</p>
<p>the whole thing</p>
<p>might be operating</p>
<p>under some sort of an</p>
<p>ethic that the</p>
<p>whole universe</p>
<p>might be operating</p>
<p>under the force of</p>
<p>like at least an energy</p>
<p>or a direction</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>think of it as</p>
<p>god as being a thing</p>
<p>but maybe god is</p>
<p>everything maybe god is all</p>
<p>things and then all</p>
<p>things work together</p>
<p>but that our job whatever our job is on this</p>
<p>earth that we&rsquo;re moving in a direction</p>
<p>where we have to compete</p>
<p>in order to</p>
<p>facilitate that movement</p>
<p>and in order to really be in competition with each</p>
<p>other we have to sort of</p>
<p>think separate from each other</p>
<p>we have to compete with each</p>
<p>other so there has to be a you and there has to be a me</p>
<p>there has to be separation</p>
<p>to compete sexually</p>
<p>there has to be</p>
<p>separation to compete financially to compete</p>
<p>you know career wise</p>
<p>and that maybe</p>
<p>all a by product of the law of nature</p>
<p>that it might be moving us</p>
<p>in this direction and that</p>
<p>might be one of the reasons why people are slowly</p>
<p>starting to come become</p>
<p>aware of that idea</p>
<p>they mean the idea that all</p>
<p>human beings and all</p>
<p>everything in this</p>
<p>whole universe are somehow connected</p>
<p>you know i mean that</p>
<p>might be really what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on but we</p>
<p>might be unaware of that because our job</p>
<p>is on this planet</p>
<p>in this life</p>
<p>in this dimension</p>
<p>our job is to</p>
<p>facilitate something our job is to compete with each</p>
<p>other in order to</p>
<p>facilitate our</p>
<p>cultural evolution</p>
<p>because if we didn&rsquo;t have that if we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think like that</p>
<p>you know if we</p>
<p>lived like monks or if we</p>
<p>you know lived like native americans</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>technology would get done you know</p>
<p>theoretically</p>
<p>at this point in time who knows</p>
<p>you know at this</p>
<p>point in time maybe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m hiding the chat rogan fans are batshit insane</p>
<p>really oh that bad what&rsquo;s going on over here</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this you stream slow as fuck</p>
<p>this guy says are</p>
<p>you as high as me i don&rsquo;t know how high you are buddy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t answer</p>
<p>trick questions</p>
<p>how dare you</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>oh ron paul hates blacks</p>
<p>are you sure</p>
<p>dennis percentage is the ron paul the left yeah</p>
<p>he seems to be another one</p>
<p>you never know what these dennis</p>
<p>percentage guys are you know i think ron paul&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty obviously legit</p>
<p>but you never know how these guys just decide that</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of money and being a rebel</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that you know they&rsquo;re just fucking playing us</p>
<p>and that they know they can get a good movement</p>
<p>going on sort of like</p>
<p>gurus you know if you</p>
<p>ever met anybody that proclaims to be like really like</p>
<p>open minded and all</p>
<p>about love but really turns out they&rsquo;re kind of all</p>
<p>about themselves and they&rsquo;re kind of like full of shit</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re really not on a quest</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just all</p>
<p>about like fulfilling</p>
<p>their ego and</p>
<p>you know and that this</p>
<p>that stance</p>
<p>the loving you know open i&rsquo;m a buddhist</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been practicing buddhism for a while now</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>know you really get to know the guy get him</p>
<p>dropping he&rsquo;s a douchebag you know</p>
<p>what is that you know</p>
<p>i think i think there&rsquo;s a lot of people doing that i</p>
<p>think that could be like the dentist</p>
<p>percentage thing too</p>
<p>who knows i mean he</p>
<p>might be legit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying dennis</p>
<p>percentage in general i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying dentists</p>
<p>specifically but it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that especially in</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s day and age</p>
<p>that someone</p>
<p>could posture</p>
<p>themselves position themselves</p>
<p>as like the outsider</p>
<p>position themselves as the rebel</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s outside the</p>
<p>system is gonna take it down</p>
<p>you know look at all this corruption look at all this</p>
<p>chaos what we need to do is this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m willing to give up all my</p>
<p>money i&rsquo;ll work for free and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>build some kind of a</p>
<p>crazy movement</p>
<p>behind them i mean it&rsquo;s really not a bad idea</p>
<p>so many disenfranchised people</p>
<p>right my my friends</p>
<p>you know the fuck i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about yeah they</p>
<p>found tons of</p>
<p>water on the moon</p>
<p>i would think that</p>
<p>would be really interesting</p>
<p>if i hadn&rsquo;t seen sunshine last night</p>
<p>right now i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about space</p>
<p>i saw a stupid science fiction</p>
<p>movie last night that was really good for like</p>
<p>three quarters of it</p>
<p>it was a fascinating</p>
<p>movie for like</p>
<p>three quarters of the</p>
<p>movie and then it just took this</p>
<p>left turn down what the fuck boulevard</p>
<p>and it was just just retarded the last</p>
<p>quarter of it is</p>
<p>literally like someone took the script</p>
<p>and got a hold of the last 20 pages and just jacked the</p>
<p>whole movie</p>
<p>just wanted to make sure that the</p>
<p>movie sucked</p>
<p>i mean it was really like somebody</p>
<p>had a vested interest in the</p>
<p>studio failing</p>
<p>opening for me tomorrow would be</p>
<p>the lovely and talented sam tripoli</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve never seen sam before he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking hilarious and he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>old school comedy store veteran</p>
<p>known sam forever</p>
<p>already had a back out last minute</p>
<p>some shit came up he just nailed some nice commercials</p>
<p>so always making some loop</p>
<p>he had to make that paper you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so already had a back out so sam tripley&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>who is a hilarious dude so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a fuck of a hell of a lot of good time</p>
<p>yeah zombie sunburn man says cheese cow</p>
<p>yeah you know what i&rsquo;m talking about man that</p>
<p>movie sucked at the end didn&rsquo;t it that was ridiculous</p>
<p>what would the</p>
<p>world be like if everyone could separate from their ego</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s the problem i don&rsquo;t think it would work</p>
<p>you know one of the you know</p>
<p>the realities of this life is there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>system set up</p>
<p>and one person out of 6 billion is not</p>
<p>going to change the whole system</p>
<p>and the way the system is set up for the</p>
<p>majority of human beings is competition</p>
<p>and competition sexually competition socially</p>
<p>competition financially</p>
<p>and that competition</p>
<p>when when you have that it</p>
<p>fosters innovation it makes sure that people create new</p>
<p>things and make sure that people work hard</p>
<p>and make sure that people compete with each</p>
<p>other and things get done</p>
<p>and i wrote a blog about this that i think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what human being&rsquo;s</p>
<p>purpose on this earth is i think that our purpose</p>
<p>as like materialists this whole idea of competition and</p>
<p>capitalism and materialism</p>
<p>that it might be really just to support technology</p>
<p>that it might be</p>
<p>the universe&rsquo;s way of making us evolve</p>
<p>that we might not just evolve physically</p>
<p>by by you know our cells</p>
<p>becoming more complex our dna becoming</p>
<p>but it might be more complicated than that</p>
<p>we might be evolving by integrating with</p>
<p>technology we might be evolving by facilitating</p>
<p>technology to to emerge and you know</p>
<p>i mean it might be as simple as</p>
<p>i wrote about in my blog</p>
<p>about there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>an aquatic worm</p>
<p>that infects grasshoppers</p>
<p>and it takes</p>
<p>over the grasshopper and makes the grasshopper a zombie</p>
<p>like it infects them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a parasite</p>
<p>gets inside</p>
<p>their body grows inside the body cavity the grasshopper</p>
<p>then rewires the grasshopper&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>and forces the grasshopper to jump into</p>
<p>water and drown</p>
<p>so that they</p>
<p>can pop out of the grasshopper&rsquo;s body and survive</p>
<p>if that ain&rsquo;t some shit</p>
<p>i mean that is fucking nuts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>crazy thing to</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>that this organism</p>
<p>tricks another organism to commit suicide</p>
<p>and thus give</p>
<p>birth to it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only way that aquatic worm</p>
<p>could live it can&rsquo;t live in the grasshoppers world</p>
<p>if it comes out in the grasshoppers</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;ll dry out and it&rsquo;ll die</p>
<p>but if it talks the grasshopper</p>
<p>into committing suicide by jumping in the lake</p>
<p>grasshoppers can&rsquo;t swim</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>a fire bug talking you into diving into a volcano it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>death if a grasshopper jumps into that</p>
<p>water it&rsquo;s certain death</p>
<p>and somehow another</p>
<p>this organism talks to grasshopper into doing it</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>might very well</p>
<p>be that our purpose as an organism that the</p>
<p>human beings purpose</p>
<p>in this world</p>
<p>is to make something else</p>
<p>that our purpose is to create a life form out of</p>
<p>technology it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>very very possible</p>
<p>if you think</p>
<p>about what life is i mean what life is</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s cellular life and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know we assume that that&rsquo;s what all life is but</p>
<p>what life is is something that reproduces</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>exists it moves</p>
<p>about of its own accord it</p>
<p>you know even while</p>
<p>plants don&rsquo;t do that but</p>
<p>plants reproduce and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a process it</p>
<p>takes in energy and puts out energy breathes in oxygen</p>
<p>puts out carbon dioxide it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that applies</p>
<p>to computers</p>
<p>that applies to</p>
<p>electronics yeah we create them</p>
<p>but they require something</p>
<p>and they release something</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re playing with a computer</p>
<p>you turn it on it requires</p>
<p>power but then it radiates images and it radiates</p>
<p>information and it connects to</p>
<p>other computers i mean there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole process it&rsquo;s very similar to a life form</p>
<p>and if at one important time</p>
<p>if they become</p>
<p>sentient that means if they be if they have a mind of</p>
<p>their own if they can</p>
<p>think for themselves they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alive if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware that you know</p>
<p>that they are</p>
<p>individuals or they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware if they become conscious</p>
<p>if that happens</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s to say that&rsquo;s not a life form</p>
<p>i mean if artificial intelligence</p>
<p>is more intelligence than us</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s artificial just because we created it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>i mean to call it artificial intelligence</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not artificial like</p>
<p>like you know here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fucking ferrari that&rsquo;s made a cake you can&rsquo;t drive it</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s fucking intelligent it&rsquo;s real intelligent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>synthetic intelligence it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>man created intelligence</p>
<p>but to call it artificial i&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the way to look at it</p>
<p>or maybe i just smoke too much wheat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible too</p>
<p>but you know i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going with my initial ideas</p>
<p>computers will have a soul</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the big question what the fuck is a soul</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>the question of what a solo that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a that&rsquo;s a slippery</p>
<p>goddamn question right there mean</p>
<p>is that real is the soul real</p>
<p>what is it is a soul energy</p>
<p>you know is a soul</p>
<p>the same in us as it is in all things</p>
<p>i mean what</p>
<p>a fucking desks have souls what if wood has a soul</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i mean i would said that to vegetarian friends</p>
<p>you know people be like</p>
<p>oh i don&rsquo;t eat meat i don&rsquo;t believe in animal suffering</p>
<p>i understand that but</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>appreciate that i like animals too but</p>
<p>what how do we not know that trees suffer</p>
<p>you now i talked to daniel</p>
<p>pinchbeck this</p>
<p>psychedelic author dude he told me that trees can</p>
<p>feel pain and that they&rsquo;ve proven it and that</p>
<p>they can detect when</p>
<p>people in a room like when someone has done them harm</p>
<p>that you can hook them up to like some sort of a sensor</p>
<p>and they can detect when the person has done harm like</p>
<p>they react when the person&rsquo;s in the room</p>
<p>so how do we not know we&rsquo;re not torturing trees</p>
<p>trees are just some life form that we can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>you know i mean it</p>
<p>might be just a</p>
<p>a less obvious version of us</p>
<p>you know being willing to imprison dolphins you know</p>
<p>maybe keeping a fucking</p>
<p>plant in your</p>
<p>house sucks for the plant</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s terrible for them</p>
<p>you know imagine what it feels like to be some</p>
<p>shitty plant that everybody forgets to</p>
<p>water and you sit there like half</p>
<p>starving to</p>
<p>death all the time</p>
<p>you know we don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a form of life</p>
<p>plants are a form of life</p>
<p>so whether you eat</p>
<p>plants or eat animals man for real</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really think that much of a difference</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat people because people talk</p>
<p>they scream supposedly</p>
<p>mm hmm they did that on mythbusters</p>
<p>is that true</p>
<p>buddy they did that on mythbusters they prove that</p>
<p>the plants can&rsquo;t think or they can&rsquo;t feel you or react</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m pretty sure that was like</p>
<p>scientific data from like a</p>
<p>university he was quoting me</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know though</p>
<p>i will leave it up to you people to google</p>
<p>i could google that shit right now but</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ll be all distracted and i</p>
<p>would not be able to keep my flow</p>
<p>best vaporizer for like 200 bucks</p>
<p>this is a hilarious question</p>
<p>vito caputo do you think phaidor is a bitch</p>
<p>yeah yeah totally</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just you go tell him go tell him his bitch</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>or submitted or beat the fuck out of</p>
<p>every human being he&rsquo;s faced</p>
<p>yeah what a bitch what</p>
<p>in regardless of whether you like to</p>
<p>ufc you want to see that match up or what</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way you can call that guy a</p>
<p>bitch that guy&rsquo;s a fucking savage</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s spooky</p>
<p>hilarious stupid stupid question my friend</p>
<p>why am i getting the same</p>
<p>twitter messages over and over again</p>
<p>stop cutting down trees this guy says</p>
<p>yeah man we got to live like avatar brother</p>
<p>try to read these</p>
<p>and find one that&rsquo;s reasonably interesting</p>
<p>god damn some of these questions are</p>
<p>crazy the ghost in the machine</p>
<p>yeah i mean look it&rsquo;s not my thought i mean</p>
<p>a million people have come up with it they have</p>
<p>movies on i mean that terminator idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all about it ray kurzweil all his ideas</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all based on the same ideas that</p>
<p>technology&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going somewhere i mean</p>
<p>it kind of makes sense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you get caught up and john kate and fucking</p>
<p>tiger woods and all this nonsense and</p>
<p>and everybody forgets</p>
<p>you know everybody forgets what the fuck is really</p>
<p>going on that we are creating</p>
<p>things we have a culture we&rsquo;re moving towards something</p>
<p>and it seems to me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my armchair</p>
<p>armchair psychologist self</p>
<p>not even psychologist armchair</p>
<p>futurist you know that something&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re moving towards something</p>
<p>and all the blinders are in</p>
<p>place to make sure that we keep going</p>
<p>all the blinders</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s one of the weirdest</p>
<p>things about being a</p>
<p>human being is that everybody</p>
<p>goes through this life pretending like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to lead to something that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to be static</p>
<p>you know instead of</p>
<p>treating it as this this wild just temporary</p>
<p>experience everybody</p>
<p>treats it like it&rsquo;s permanent like you&rsquo;re saving</p>
<p>things and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting aside savings and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>planning for the future and you know one day i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna make it and we have this whole idea like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get somewhere</p>
<p>and then everything is gonna stop</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just bullshit no</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s just being real with us about that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all temporary</p>
<p>and the fact that we don&rsquo;t address that</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t embrace</p>
<p>really embrace the moment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like one of the most important</p>
<p>things about being a human</p>
<p>recognizing this shit is just</p>
<p>fleeting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go and you gotta just</p>
<p>pile in as much</p>
<p>enjoyment and</p>
<p>pleasure and fun and positive energy as you can</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about spread as much as you can</p>
<p>leave as much</p>
<p>to help other people as you can</p>
<p>say as much as you</p>
<p>think that you</p>
<p>think is gonna help</p>
<p>other people i mean that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>meanwhile we&rsquo;re all fucking</p>
<p>planning for a bigger house</p>
<p>no working on saving for a bigger tv</p>
<p>constantly distracting ourselves with</p>
<p>fucking items items and</p>
<p>and notions notions of retirement and the golden</p>
<p>age and someday</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna do this</p>
<p>some but you&rsquo;re not doing shit it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right now is someday</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no sun day there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>moment and this moment goes on forever</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of shit happening during this moment</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things that keep</p>
<p>going on like the</p>
<p>earth keeps</p>
<p>spinning around a star</p>
<p>and you keep getting</p>
<p>tired and you have to rest for a little</p>
<p>while but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still the same goddamn moment</p>
<p>we need to treat it like that</p>
<p>we need to treat it like it&rsquo;s one big thing</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be here forever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one big fucking ride</p>
<p>and it lasts 80 something years</p>
<p>and then who knows</p>
<p>and who fucking knows</p>
<p>why do you think america has never made a big deal</p>
<p>out of russia giving us the 9 11 monument hmm</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know they did</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t thought about that i don&rsquo;t know um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know what that monument is</p>
<p>you know i mean look the whole 9 11 thing man</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about who the fuck knows what any of it is all about</p>
<p>do you write comedy or does it flow out</p>
<p>you have to write</p>
<p>very important you can&rsquo;t just flow</p>
<p>it out because you&rsquo;ll forget a lot of the shit you say</p>
<p>you know you have to</p>
<p>write it down</p>
<p>and writing down helps you</p>
<p>come up with more</p>
<p>things and branch off of it</p>
<p>it takes longer to like</p>
<p>to write a word that it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of the word you know you think</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<p>polar bear you know</p>
<p>polar bear you</p>
<p>think about a</p>
<p>polar bear instantly</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<p>about that polar bear</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the act of putting down the</p>
<p>letters and the act of putting together the sentences</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s much much much more thinking</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why my blogs</p>
<p>i think anybody&rsquo;s writing you know if you edit it</p>
<p>will always sound</p>
<p>much smoother more</p>
<p>precise more concise than</p>
<p>these retarded</p>
<p>ramblings that i do on you stream</p>
<p>and then the you</p>
<p>stream ramblings i don&rsquo;t have any notes</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna say i don&rsquo;t have a fucking clue</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s for me that&rsquo;s the best way i do it</p>
<p>because i just get on and i just</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about shit and</p>
<p>then just let it happen and let it flow up but like</p>
<p>for for stand up comedy you</p>
<p>gotta do a lot of writing to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be both</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be</p>
<p>gotta have the ability to just flow with things</p>
<p>and like like like this weekend</p>
<p>something happened with the you know the killer whale</p>
<p>thing and i</p>
<p>when i was in</p>
<p>dallas i had like</p>
<p>ten minutes on the killer whale</p>
<p>but it was all shit that i had like</p>
<p>written down</p>
<p>that day and then just fucked around with that</p>
<p>night just went with it</p>
<p>so i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have both</p>
<p>you have to have writing but you have to</p>
<p>you have to be able to flow with</p>
<p>things too you have to be able to take chances too</p>
<p>you know you gotta</p>
<p>comedies like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you have to have a road map</p>
<p>you have to know</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going but</p>
<p>you can take a little detours you know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on your way you have a map you know</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go you</p>
<p>could go off into the woods for a little while</p>
<p>and sometimes when you go off in the woods for a little</p>
<p>while you get more interesting shit out of it you know</p>
<p>and i think people</p>
<p>appreciate it you know like when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that happens</p>
<p>you know that day with like the killer</p>
<p>whale and then a guy goes on</p>
<p>stage at that</p>
<p>night and talks</p>
<p>about it you</p>
<p>know that this guy&rsquo;s just winging this i mean he had a</p>
<p>wrote some stuff down but this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stuff he&rsquo;s worked on</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t some material</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done a hundred times shit just happened yesterday</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about that man it makes it more fun</p>
<p>makes it more more it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>alive or something you know people can be sure</p>
<p>you know part of comedy</p>
<p>is like the</p>
<p>trick and the</p>
<p>trick is to make you</p>
<p>think that i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking right now</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>when you really can</p>
<p>pull that off it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s something something</p>
<p>extra special</p>
<p>about it so i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s both you know i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s both</p>
<p>you got a right</p>
<p>and you got a fuck around too</p>
<p>what do i think of parallel universes says</p>
<p>ace of spades</p>
<p>1369 you know what is more fascinating to me</p>
<p>people with numbers in the end of their names</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that all about</p>
<p>especially when they have like sixty nine</p>
<p>the rocker sixty nine shut the fuck up please</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in the sixty nine bro</p>
<p>minute eating</p>
<p>pussy while i get my dick sucked</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in my name i&rsquo;m crazy</p>
<p>plus you could have</p>
<p>sixty nine didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even change tell you to take it down man</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>mike i like to eat pussy</p>
<p>while i get my dick sucked that can&rsquo;t be your name</p>
<p>people get upset at you</p>
<p>but you can just throw</p>
<p>sixty nine there and then give him a wink</p>
<p>hey man what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>sixty nine the end of your name about</p>
<p>anyway i forgot</p>
<p>your fucking question that&rsquo;s how dumb it was</p>
<p>not really sir i&rsquo;m just fucking around</p>
<p>i really did forget your question though</p>
<p>sure could have been that fascinating</p>
<p>jimmy norton loves me</p>
<p>i love him too i&rsquo;m gonna see in a couple couple weeks</p>
<p>are you smart because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funny or funny because you&rsquo;re smart</p>
<p>you know funny it&rsquo;s just being honest</p>
<p>and recognizing all the fucking</p>
<p>crazy shit that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like really</p>
<p>comedy is like really just</p>
<p>tuning into the the retardedness of the universe</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all there for you</p>
<p>you know i mean you</p>
<p>write it down you expose it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you know the raw materials are all there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like mining for diamonds</p>
<p>in a room filled with diamonds</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>stand up comedy in america in 2010</p>
<p>it literally is like you know</p>
<p>like what do you do</p>
<p>oh i go out and i find money</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everywhere on the ground</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>your raw material is life itself</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you mind you mind life the</p>
<p>ridiculousness of life whenever you see</p>
<p>warranted warranted</p>
<p>irony warranted</p>
<p>things to be mocked warranted</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>right in front of your face</p>
<p>people complaining about avatar you know</p>
<p>meanwhile we got two wars going on known says a peep</p>
<p>i have not read christopher hitchens god is not</p>
<p>great but that guy is a</p>
<p>pretty badass arguer he&rsquo;s really good at</p>
<p>trouncing people</p>
<p>i enjoy watching him</p>
<p>lash lash christians you know</p>
<p>fundamentalist christians he gives them a beating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>no i never got a copy the youtube</p>
<p>show that i didn&rsquo;t save it was much like this one</p>
<p>i was just fucking around talking and</p>
<p>i forgot to save it this time</p>
<p>i know what the fuck i did</p>
<p>wrong i will make sure that i save it</p>
<p>what do i think</p>
<p>about the couple inches that the axis has</p>
<p>shifted i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s really a couple inches but</p>
<p>apparently the</p>
<p>the earthquake</p>
<p>in chile was so big</p>
<p>that it shortened our day</p>
<p>it changed our day by like</p>
<p>like a millisecond like</p>
<p>fraction of a millisecond whatever it is</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a measurable amount</p>
<p>that it shorten our day that&rsquo;s how because it changed</p>
<p>the the the distribution of the mass in the earth</p>
<p>how fucking crazy is that</p>
<p>the earthquake was so strong it shorten our day</p>
<p>which makes you think</p>
<p>like when earth gets hit by meteors</p>
<p>like giant fucking</p>
<p>asteroids like the one that killed the dinosaurs</p>
<p>i wonder if that like can</p>
<p>shorten or lengthen the day</p>
<p>i mean it seems like it</p>
<p>could right</p>
<p>it seems like it only makes</p>
<p>sense that it would like</p>
<p>if you add mass to the</p>
<p>earth so these these</p>
<p>things are gigantic you know</p>
<p>five hundred mile across</p>
<p>hunks of metal and rock and shit from</p>
<p>space they come</p>
<p>slamming into the earth</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that that has to increase the mass of the</p>
<p>earth right</p>
<p>unless it knocks</p>
<p>off just as much as it puts back and that&rsquo;s how like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they believe the earth</p>
<p>developed a moon</p>
<p>they believe there was</p>
<p>earth one and</p>
<p>earth two and earth</p>
<p>one got hit by a fucking planet</p>
<p>we got hit by a planet</p>
<p>and apparently that happens</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>crazy can you imagine that we were</p>
<p>about to get hit by a planet</p>
<p>you know imagine if you look up and mars is like</p>
<p>right fucking there like</p>
<p>right behind the moon</p>
<p>and coming towards us and there&rsquo;s nothing we</p>
<p>could do about it</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>in some solar</p>
<p>systems that happens to</p>
<p>earth it&rsquo;s happened before</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing called bodes law</p>
<p>and bode&rsquo;s law is the way it works i believe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been told at</p>
<p>least by the scientist fella</p>
<p>he told me that the mass of</p>
<p>certain things they measure</p>
<p>about a planet</p>
<p>particularly the mass but a</p>
<p>few other things too</p>
<p>and in measuring</p>
<p>those they can</p>
<p>pretty accurately</p>
<p>judge where the next planet will be in that</p>
<p>solar system</p>
<p>well it applies to all the planets in our</p>
<p>solar system except</p>
<p>to mars and jupiter</p>
<p>because mars and jupiter</p>
<p>apparently according to this gentleman i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure if it&rsquo;s correct look it up google it please</p>
<p>he said that mars and jupiter</p>
<p>in fact there</p>
<p>should be a planet in between them</p>
<p>and according to bode&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>but there is not instead there is an asteroid belt</p>
<p>which makes some theorize</p>
<p>that that is the result of another planetary</p>
<p>collision or</p>
<p>maybe the same one that created</p>
<p>earth that like</p>
<p>something got fucking</p>
<p>cracked like it</p>
<p>guess it happens a lot</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s even written</p>
<p>about in the</p>
<p>sumerian text</p>
<p>the sumerian text</p>
<p>depicts you know this is</p>
<p>some shit that was written like 6 000 years ago on</p>
<p>clay tablets</p>
<p>depicts that that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>how earth was created</p>
<p>it depicts that we you know</p>
<p>these two planets called</p>
<p>tiamat and marduk</p>
<p>collided and they created</p>
<p>earth it&rsquo;s very similar to our own</p>
<p>earth one and</p>
<p>earth two hypothesis</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really fucking fascinating shit man</p>
<p>you know the idea that</p>
<p>the universe is</p>
<p>static it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>static at all</p>
<p>you know the center of</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>galaxy is a</p>
<p>supermassive</p>
<p>black hole that&rsquo;s exactly one half of 1</p>
<p>of the mass of the galaxy</p>
<p>so the bigger the galaxy the bigger the</p>
<p>supermassive</p>
<p>black hole and</p>
<p>those things are</p>
<p>just eating stars up all the time i mean you see like</p>
<p>the big spiral around like</p>
<p>black holes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating they&rsquo;re eating planets</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going getting forced into the event horizon</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really really really nutty shit</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>could get hit by a fucking planet</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>could be real</p>
<p>fucking asteroid we can get hit by a goddamn planet</p>
<p>i mean it hasn&rsquo;t happened</p>
<p>you know in billions and billions</p>
<p>and billions of years it&rsquo;s not likely to happen</p>
<p>but what if it happens</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking nuts</p>
<p>tiamat and marduke babylonian gods made the</p>
<p>earth yeah it&rsquo;s all this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all from the same part of the earth</p>
<p>or yeah it&rsquo;s from iraq</p>
<p>where iraq is</p>
<p>today used to be some air</p>
<p>and the sumerian text all talks</p>
<p>about the creation of the earth</p>
<p>and you could dismiss it but</p>
<p>they knew a lot of shit</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>they had a very accurate depiction of our</p>
<p>of our solar</p>
<p>system with</p>
<p>all the planets in the correct size in the correct</p>
<p>orbit including</p>
<p>pluto and we didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about pluto until 1930</p>
<p>so who the fuck knows but they also talk about</p>
<p>beings from another planet that supposedly</p>
<p>created human beings using genetic engineering</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very possible that what we get with</p>
<p>these old old</p>
<p>civilizations that had a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of knowledge</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that what that is</p>
<p>is the remnants of an even earlier</p>
<p>civilization that was possibly wiped out</p>
<p>like our idea that earth</p>
<p>that it moves on a very</p>
<p>very linear that</p>
<p>our society</p>
<p>progresses on a very linear line that&rsquo;s easy to follow</p>
<p>you know like there&rsquo;s cavemen</p>
<p>and at the end there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>human beings in 2010</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very disputed</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people graham hancock is one of my favorites</p>
<p>and john anthony west is another</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another of</p>
<p>these a lot of</p>
<p>these archeologists that support the idea that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that</p>
<p>human beings who have been around</p>
<p>way way way longer than we think</p>
<p>like thirty</p>
<p>forty hundreds of thousands of years like we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that our culture</p>
<p>the reason why our</p>
<p>culture is so advanced</p>
<p>today over such a</p>
<p>short period of time</p>
<p>is cause we&rsquo;re really relearning complex</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>technology and tools and</p>
<p>and you know electricity and the internet</p>
<p>and in fact</p>
<p>these old cultures</p>
<p>that had all this knowledge knowledge of genetics that</p>
<p>existed in the</p>
<p>sumerian culture and all that</p>
<p>the reason why</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>had this is because that&rsquo;s knowledge that they got from</p>
<p>an even earlier</p>
<p>culture that was probably wiped out</p>
<p>by some fucking</p>
<p>super volcano or an</p>
<p>earthquake or a meteor</p>
<p>who knows i mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of evidence that some</p>
<p>crazy shit has happened over and over and over</p>
<p>again on this planet</p>
<p>and not just</p>
<p>crazy shit like</p>
<p>killing the dinosaurs but</p>
<p>crazy shit like during our lifetime</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>were certainly around ten thousand years ago</p>
<p>but not only</p>
<p>that you know what else was around 10 000 years ago</p>
<p>fucking woolly mammoths and sabretooth</p>
<p>tigers and half of</p>
<p>north america was</p>
<p>under a mile high</p>
<p>sheet of ice</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>crazy ice age</p>
<p>going on and it</p>
<p>ended almost instantaneously with</p>
<p>these animals</p>
<p>becoming extinct almost instantaneously</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people that theorize that&rsquo;s because of some sort of</p>
<p>a natural cataclysmic disaster</p>
<p>some sort of a meteor impact</p>
<p>or something fucking nutty</p>
<p>that wiped out all the woolly mammoths all the</p>
<p>saber tooth tigers</p>
<p>fucked up all</p>
<p>cultures all over the world</p>
<p>and sort of</p>
<p>reset human</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that people existed</p>
<p>a long long long time before that</p>
<p>and that culture</p>
<p>existed a long long time before that</p>
<p>you know and people say well</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the evidence of that culture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>tricky thing because what evidence</p>
<p>would there be you know</p>
<p>you ever see that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a discovery channel show i believe it is life</p>
<p>after people</p>
<p>which shows like how quickly</p>
<p>things get eaten up</p>
<p>you know in detroit</p>
<p>detroit is so bad</p>
<p>right now the economy so fucked up and</p>
<p>crazy that bears</p>
<p>are moving back into detroit they have bear</p>
<p>sightings in the fucking city</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no bullshit</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so desolate</p>
<p>that so many</p>
<p>houses are abandoned</p>
<p>and these houses</p>
<p>plants are growing up through the fucking</p>
<p>floorboards</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>been a few years and nature is already trying to devour</p>
<p>these buildings</p>
<p>nature&rsquo;s trees are</p>
<p>covering these and this is a cold ass fucking climate</p>
<p>where these trees can only grow</p>
<p>you know a few</p>
<p>months out of the year</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really really naughty shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some some images in russia there too</p>
<p>of all these different</p>
<p>places in russia that were abandoned</p>
<p>after the fall of the soviet</p>
<p>union and these</p>
<p>places were</p>
<p>abandoned and now nature is just taking them over</p>
<p>trees are growing through</p>
<p>buildings and</p>
<p>just literally consuming things</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s probably difficult to find evidence of a</p>
<p>culture a couple thousand years ago</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s in stone</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>stuff that we find from thousands of years ago</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the pyramid type</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>stone things</p>
<p>those things last forever</p>
<p>stone tablets</p>
<p>clay pottery</p>
<p>stone buildings that shit last forever but metal</p>
<p>electronics like that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna be gone</p>
<p>that stuff will just get</p>
<p>eaten up by the</p>
<p>earth and swallow</p>
<p>evidence of a</p>
<p>culture 30 000 years ago that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll all get swallowed</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>there are so many temples</p>
<p>that they find that are swallowed up by the rainforest</p>
<p>in in south america</p>
<p>mayan temples</p>
<p>incredibly complex</p>
<p>pyramids and all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things that are</p>
<p>covered up by rainforest</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably hundreds of them that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never found</p>
<p>they just they</p>
<p>waited too long</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>covered up by trees</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in mexico</p>
<p>city they&rsquo;re all in mexico city they&rsquo;re always like</p>
<p>building things and then finding really old</p>
<p>you know mayan ruins</p>
<p>underneath mexico city they find that shit all the time</p>
<p>where they have to</p>
<p>halt construction</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>found some monuments and they found some</p>
<p>some you know</p>
<p>ancient walls or something and turns out there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole goddamn city down there</p>
<p>not a lot of evidence</p>
<p>not a lot of evidence happens</p>
<p>after you know</p>
<p>just 10 000 years so i have a feeling that what</p>
<p>what we get out of like the sumerian</p>
<p>culture and all these people that knew all these</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>you know that knew</p>
<p>about mars and or knew</p>
<p>about pluto and knew</p>
<p>about genetic engineering all these ideas</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very possible</p>
<p>very very possible that what they knew</p>
<p>was just some shit</p>
<p>that ancient ancient</p>
<p>civilizations who were just as advanced as us</p>
<p>maybe became</p>
<p>advanced in a different way but just as advanced as us</p>
<p>that they had figured it out</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s so true with so many different</p>
<p>cultures you know and</p>
<p>the idea that like you know people read the</p>
<p>sumerian text and they say well</p>
<p>you know these these</p>
<p>sumerians say that</p>
<p>the anunnaki came from another galaxy</p>
<p>and you know they they created</p>
<p>humans with you know</p>
<p>with genetic engineering so well there it&rsquo;s written in</p>
<p>stone it&rsquo;s got to be true</p>
<p>no people are full of shit in</p>
<p>2010 you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they were full of shit</p>
<p>5000 years bc</p>
<p>the ancient</p>
<p>sumerian text</p>
<p>could easily be</p>
<p>6000 years ago</p>
<p>version of scientology</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very very very possible</p>
<p>you know just because it&rsquo;s written down on rocks</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of goddamn questions</p>
<p>all right i&rsquo;m only</p>
<p>gonna ramble</p>
<p>for a little bit longer because i</p>
<p>gotta get the fuck out of here because i</p>
<p>gotta go to canada bitches oh shits</p>
<p>like i said i&rsquo;m headed there this weekend</p>
<p>very excited</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait looking forward to</p>
<p>it very much so</p>
<p>i am going to</p>
<p>casino nova scotia in</p>
<p>halifax thursday night</p>
<p>and then friday night</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in the branson center in</p>
<p>ottawa and then saturday night</p>
<p>queen elizabeth theater in toronto</p>
<p>you dirty bitches</p>
<p>and thank you everyone for coming out</p>
<p>to these shows i&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>excited it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most fun</p>
<p>thing that i</p>
<p>do for sure you know i mean i love work for the</p>
<p>ufc and i love</p>
<p>i mean i love a lot of different</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done but nothing&rsquo;s more fun than comedy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>most open ended art form</p>
<p>you know and it&rsquo;s the the the art form that i have the</p>
<p>the most the most control over so it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>you can be you</p>
<p>could be the freest you can</p>
<p>you could show people exactly what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking say exactly</p>
<p>which on your mind and this too and this</p>
<p>thing i think</p>
<p>you know i talked to a comic</p>
<p>about this we saying like</p>
<p>you know you do your rambling on this youtube thing</p>
<p>or this you stream</p>
<p>thing rather</p>
<p>he said aren&rsquo;t you like eating up some material</p>
<p>said not really i think i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m like coming up with material doing this</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m not crazy</p>
<p>so i never get a chance to just talk like this okay</p>
<p>i never get a chance to have like a one way</p>
<p>cop this like</p>
<p>a one way conversation you can&rsquo;t talk back</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m listening to some of the shit that you say</p>
<p>on on the twitter</p>
<p>but i mean i&rsquo;m not you not you don&rsquo;t get to talk</p>
<p>i only talk for an hour and that&rsquo;s very unnatural</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>rambling long</p>
<p>long rants like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>way that&rsquo;s the best way to come up with new shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s writing</p>
<p>and writing is important too but this is another</p>
<p>interesting component</p>
<p>and i think i</p>
<p>think doing</p>
<p>these ustream things</p>
<p>has been taking my material to another level</p>
<p>another level</p>
<p>yes doing the you stream</p>
<p>thing doing</p>
<p>what doing the you</p>
<p>stream you stream</p>
<p>things has been taking my material to another level i</p>
<p>think it gives me more of an opportunity to fuck around</p>
<p>more of an opportunity just</p>
<p>rant about shit</p>
<p>you know when you ran</p>
<p>about shit sometimes you ranting</p>
<p>about shit with a buddy</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;ll say something you forget what you were</p>
<p>gonna say and then</p>
<p>you go back to it but you don&rsquo;t have it anymore</p>
<p>but with this it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one hour i think</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna switch to</p>
<p>uh doing it</p>
<p>twice a week though</p>
<p>i think what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do is like this one hour and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>twice a week</p>
<p>so wednesday um</p>
<p>and i might do</p>
<p>monday too so as of</p>
<p>right now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna leave it as is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna keep doing wednesdays</p>
<p>but i think i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try to do it</p>
<p>twice a week i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s better to do a little less time</p>
<p>a little more often</p>
<p>and i wouldn&rsquo;t want to listen to me</p>
<p>talk for more than a fucking hour</p>
<p>and you know if you&rsquo;re at work</p>
<p>listening to me rambo for more than an hour</p>
<p>jesus goddamn christ go to work get</p>
<p>your shit done</p>
<p>unless you can get your shit done</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re doing what i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>listening to me and then i</p>
<p>would say god damn you got a mindless ass job</p>
<p>if you can listen to my nonsense and</p>
<p>still get done what you&rsquo;re doing no problem whatsoever</p>
<p>what are you doing you fixing</p>
<p>shoes what are you doing</p>
<p>nothing wrong with</p>
<p>fixing shoes</p>
<p>all right ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>this guy says plus one</p>
<p>twice a week</p>
<p>yeah well we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have all the shows up in mp3</p>
<p>brian red band just finished the site that he</p>
<p>wrote and in the</p>
<p>in the next day or two we&rsquo;ll have that new site up</p>
<p>and the new</p>
<p>site will have the ability to directly podcast so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll all be on itunes i know i keep fucking</p>
<p>promising that but</p>

<p>you can watch this</p>
<p>you know if you</p>
<p>gotta watch you</p>
<p>gonna watch it</p>
<p>all right um</p>
