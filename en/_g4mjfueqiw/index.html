<p>questions they have today and if you</p>

<p>use the social media ask the questions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll try to get to</p>
<p>everyone this time right steve oh</p>

<p>that was a sarcasm because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably three thousand people on right</p>
<p>now but anything i say is definitely not</p>
<p>meant to</p>
<p>replace your medical care or diagnose</p>
<p>you um this is just food for thought</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>yes so that&rsquo;s my disclaimer</p>
<p>all right steve</p>
<p>all right where should we start well i</p>
<p>think we should start with social media</p>
<p>because this is such an interesting</p>
<p>question tara</p>
<p>uh from india</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s on youtube wants to know if</p>
<p>she chews and then spits out her food</p>
<p>without swallowing will that affect her</p>
<p>insulin now it&rsquo;s not going to affect</p>
<p>your insulin in fact if you want</p>
<p>just eat whatever you want have a hole</p>
<p>right through here just have the food</p>
<p>come out and uh you will not</p>
<p>not create any problem with insulin i</p>
<p>promise you you will lose weight</p>
<p>rapidly i&rsquo;m sure so anyway why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>go to our first guest in the green room</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s laquan who is my neighbor in</p>
<p>charlotte north carolina</p>
<p>and he has some questions for you uh</p>
<p>laquan make sure you&rsquo;re unmuted you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on with dr byrd</p>
<p>i think laquan is</p>
<p>frozen currently let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>marco instead marco stand by i&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to unmute you and he is a veteran of</p>
<p>many zoo meetings so he knows what to do</p>
<p>marco you&rsquo;re on with dr bird</p>
<p>hello doctor good morning to you</p>
<p>good morning</p>
<p>well my question is um well first of all</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been on a ketogenic lifestyle for</p>
<p>about two years lost weight and i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>the process of curing my um fatty liver</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>my liver seems to be still sluggish and</p>
<p>i have um you know a cycle of</p>
<p>constipation and then it goes away and</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ve been taking some bile salts</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know the exact dosage of the</p>
<p>bile sauce and the fasting state when</p>
<p>should i take bile salts and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question i think i think</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re um you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eliminating</p>
<p>um on a regular basis is a big clue that</p>
<p>you do need more bile so i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the right direction i think</p>
<p>you know the bile salts that you take</p>
<p>are are not going to be that that much</p>
<p>so i would take i would take them with</p>
<p>meal with meals and i would take them on</p>
<p>an empty stomach</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>you may be better off doing like a</p>
<p>regular a gallbladder formula or a</p>
<p>bios uh bio salts with meals like two</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>try that and then what you do is you</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>one on empty stomach um i i like to take</p>
<p>uh something called tutka</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>which is a kind of like an additional</p>
<p>ninja bile salt</p>
<p>in addition to the regular one and then</p>
<p>what will happen is that uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll really open up the liver but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good for a fatty liver and</p>
<p>it has a lot of other benefits too with</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>constipation and</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory and blood sugars and</p>
<p>but yeah i think um you&rsquo;re on the right</p>
<p>track you just need to tweak things uh</p>
<p>another good one would be</p>
<p>choline that&rsquo;s a good one make sure you</p>
<p>have a lot of cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>with choline as well and other factors</p>
<p>to help remove the fat off the liver</p>
<p>and supply the food for the microbes and</p>
<p>then make your own bile so</p>
<p>um but if you give it more time</p>
<p>you will see a huge change in in</p>
<p>your fatty liver and it should you know</p>
<p>but it does take some time but i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be happy</p>
<p>thanks for enriching our lives and um</p>
<p>helping us moving forward doctor you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been great</p>
<p>well thank you marco for uh</p>
<p>starting off kicking off the show for us</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another one dr berg from social</p>
<p>media also on youtube and i feel bad for</p>
<p>uh henrietta</p>
<p>says she has is an uncontrollable</p>
<p>diabetic high sugar and she&rsquo;s just tired</p>
<p>and kind of losing interest you know i</p>
<p>guess getting really frustrated and</p>
<p>wants to know how she can remedy that</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really hard to tell her what</p>
<p>to do if i don&rsquo;t see her diet</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m assuming she&rsquo;s probably not on keto</p>
<p>or intermittent fasting because that</p>
<p>would lower the blood sugar but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say for</p>
<p>that you were on the ketogenic plan and</p>
<p>you were doing intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>your blood sugar was still high</p>
<p>that just means that you have so much</p>
<p>insulin resistance</p>
<p>and or</p>
<p>your pancreas the cells of the pancreas</p>
<p>are not producing enough insulin so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to push the sugar down</p>
<p>so it goes up</p>
<p>in which case you need to um</p>
<p>really work on that</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>beta cell and</p>
<p>i will be releasing a video this week on</p>
<p>some more data on how to improve that</p>
<p>but like vitamin d</p>
<p>zinc</p>
<p>b1 essential for overcoming this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very low carb</p>
<p>uh doing periodic prolonged fasting i</p>
<p>mean think about this if you eat nothing</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing to raise your blood</p>
<p>sugars</p>
<p>eventually it should come down unless</p>
<p>your body then is going to make new</p>
<p>sugar which</p>
<p>that will improve as well over time when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re correcting some resistance but</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t really give that i can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>give a good answer until i have more</p>
<p>information about it but i would</p>
<p>do the things i said and uh this report</p>
<p>back to us and let us know how you do</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s fantastic and by the way</p>
<p>laquan who froze on screen has</p>
<p>ingeniously come back to us looks like</p>
<p>through his iphone and uh laquan if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re unmuted and go</p>
<p>ahead with your one question for dr byrd</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m back um how you doing dr berg</p>
<p>great thanks</p>
<p>um yeah i had a question</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very heavily into fitness i work about</p>
<p>five six days a week uh i&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>a slim guy um but i&rsquo;m interested in keto</p>
<p>but i do a lot of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but my main thing is that i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>gain more muscle more more mass</p>
<p>and give a little bit more weight so my</p>
<p>main thing is longevity and health so i</p>
<p>want to gain weight and gain muscle in a</p>
<p>healthy way</p>
<p>yeah i think your best bet and this is a</p>
<p>common question is to um</p>
<p>you want to gain muscle mass but you</p>
<p>also want to receive the benefits of</p>
<p>keto um</p>
<p>because the high insulin is just a</p>
<p>problem with other issues so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>i think you can</p>
<p>focus on</p>
<p>doing keto but keep your carbs at 50</p>
<p>grams a day as your maximum so don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>higher than that so you&rsquo;re on the higher</p>
<p>end but you&rsquo;re still in ketosis</p>
<p>but the the thing with muscle is that</p>
<p>the major driver of muscle is the</p>
<p>stimulation of the muscle the intensity</p>
<p>of the workout so as long as your</p>
<p>workouts are intense and you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>full body</p>
<p>like a lot of volume</p>
<p>of exercise for your muscles they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to grow</p>
<p>and think about this too when you do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can stimulate growth hormone by a</p>
<p>factor of 2 000</p>
<p>versus a diet which should</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s only like 700 i&rsquo;m sorry with</p>
<p>exercise which is only like 700</p>
<p>so fasting even though it might seem</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re gonna your muscles are gonna</p>
<p>waste away is one thing to stimulate</p>
<p>growth hormone which can actually</p>
<p>activate things but i&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about doing a long fast but definitely</p>
<p>regular fasting is going to be important</p>
<p>and then if you add in there</p>
<p>some intense exercise like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably already doing but just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be helpful then keep</p>
<p>your carbs at 50 gram and maybe also</p>
<p>go up with your protein a little bit</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so instead of like the eight</p>
<p>ounces per meal do nine ounces per meal</p>
<p>because that will</p>
<p>that will stimulate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>also with glucagon which is another</p>
<p>hormone that will help you counter the</p>
<p>effects of insulin so</p>
<p>instead of trying to raise it with carbs</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s raise it a little bit with insulin</p>
<p>and see how that works for you</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great well listen thank you</p>
<p>uh laquan and by the way we might</p>
<p>mention i hope she comes on his wife has</p>
<p>lost</p>
<p>a hundred pounds with the keto lifestyle</p>
<p>so congratulations to her</p>
<p>laquan that&rsquo;s fantastic and we hope we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>love to have uh your wife on with us at</p>
<p>some point and tell us about her journey</p>
<p>and you know continued path to terrific</p>
<p>health so it looks like laquan and</p>
<p>family by the way you got a baby boy</p>
<p>real cute in the background and i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>that poor kid&rsquo;s not going to get</p>
<p>anything but brussels sprouts no tootsie</p>
<p>pops good for you man</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>i would tell you i&rsquo;m going to give you</p>
<p>one little piece of advice</p>
<p>start your child</p>
<p>uh early with keto don&rsquo;t wait till</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a teenager just just a tip</p>
<p>sounds good i&rsquo;ll remember that</p>
<p>yeah that sounds great well listen</p>
<p>congratulations on your healthy uh</p>
<p>burgeoning family it&rsquo;s great to have you</p>
<p>on laquan</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see we haven&rsquo;t done a question</p>
<p>a quiz question yet doc so let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>that started</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what occurs in the body just before</p>
<p>someone gets an infection either from a</p>
<p>virus</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>a bacteria</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that usually occurs</p>
<p>right before</p>
<p>i want to see how many of you know this</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>all right get on it audience and by the</p>
<p>way brucy as he describes himself this</p>
<p>time from facebook and this is a little</p>
<p>sad but i&rsquo;m sure a very common</p>
<p>issue with people around the world can</p>
<p>you talk about the best supplements to</p>
<p>counter the effects of alcohol and drug</p>
<p>abuse i mean i think there&rsquo;s an obvious</p>
<p>question to that but if someone&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>not in the</p>
<p>position to be able to get off of it is</p>
<p>there anything they can do to ease the</p>
<p>blow</p>
<p>well i think the best thing to do is to</p>
<p>do things to increase your overall mood</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>drinking</p>
<p>to you know try to cover up or trying to</p>
<p>kind of treat a lower emotion</p>
<p>people tend to drink when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stressed when they&rsquo;re depressed so if</p>
<p>you can raise your mood up then that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be you&rsquo;ll be less likely to do that and</p>
<p>i think the way to do that is the keto</p>
<p>with intermittent fasting it puts the</p>
<p>control over your body and it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>exercise for self-discipline because if</p>
<p>you can start doing fasting it forces</p>
<p>you to</p>
<p>not eat and</p>
<p>versus a lot of people cave to snacks</p>
<p>especially at night</p>
<p>but i think the b vitamins are essential</p>
<p>especially b1 and this thing called</p>
<p>nutritional yeast which steve knows all</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>that can greatly help you</p>
<p>and you can get them into tablets and</p>
<p>start chewing them most of the day</p>
<p>vitamin d is another one for a</p>
<p>supplement and then of course</p>
<p>milk thistle</p>
<p>as a great</p>
<p>amazing nutrient herb for</p>
<p>the liver and it actually repairs liver</p>
<p>damage and it keeps your liver roll</p>
<p>healthy and i think</p>
<p>those are some things that i would do to</p>
<p>help with the cravings and the</p>
<p>addictions</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great well i tell you</p>
<p>audience and dr berg knows this i had a</p>
<p>misspent youth i&rsquo;m a child of the 60s</p>
<p>and early 70s and there was all sorts of</p>
<p>mischief you could get into and i got</p>
<p>into all of it you know in terms of</p>
<p>substance abuse etc and there is a path</p>
<p>forward and as many people say you know</p>
<p>the only thing i did when i was using</p>
<p>drugs and alcohol was trying to feel</p>
<p>better because i didn&rsquo;t feel well and</p>
<p>now i do through a healthy lifestyle so</p>
<p>you know it seems sort of some people</p>
<p>would feel that they&rsquo;re really really</p>
<p>trapped in this addiction and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing beyond it that can make them</p>
<p>feel good and that&rsquo;s not true and if i</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t getting a great buzz so to speak</p>
<p>on a good healthy lifestyle without any</p>
<p>drugs or alcohol i&rsquo;d return to it so</p>
<p>there really is hope beyond that and so</p>
<p>few folks to kind of make fun what do i</p>
<p>do if i&rsquo;m you know horribly addicted</p>
<p>what kind of health thing can i do to</p>
<p>improve it well the obvious thing is to</p>
<p>quit but you know that&rsquo;s a tall order</p>
<p>for a lot of people so really wish all</p>
<p>those people well and know that</p>
<p>if you can follow dr berg and like uh</p>
<p>you know recommendations there is life</p>
<p>beyond drug abuse</p>
<p>you know steve you you mentioned</p>
<p>something that remember that guy who um</p>
<p>he he was so down um he he was depressed</p>
<p>he decided to commit suicide so he</p>
<p>started to</p>
<p>stop eating he was gonna starve himself</p>
<p>after the third day he started feeling</p>
<p>so much better and i have a video on</p>
<p>this he</p>
<p>he started looking at fasting and he</p>
<p>said wow this is what i&rsquo;ve been missing</p>
<p>so it rebounded on him but i will say</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mood in their emotional state is a huge</p>
<p>factor</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>their overall behaviors and things like</p>
<p>that so do whatever you can to raise</p>
<p>your mood to a bigger higher level state</p>
<p>where you can be more in control</p>
<p>because people do things that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t normally um wouldn&rsquo;t normally do</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re in a lower emotional state</p>
<p>yeah absolutely and i&rsquo;ve told people</p>
<p>many times that my uh</p>
<p>impetus to</p>
<p>live a healthy lifestyle with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and lower carbs is</p>
<p>not so that i can get back into my</p>
<p>bikini figure but rather so that i can</p>
<p>feel emotionally whole that&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>thing battling depression for me is the</p>
<p>key motivator and when i get results boy</p>
<p>is it easier to stay on that lifestyle</p>
<p>and anyway enough about me let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to our question which has already been</p>
<p>answered and doc can you read that</p>
<p>okay what occurs in the body just before</p>
<p>someone</p>
<p>acquires an infection</p>
<p>okay in the audience uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>40 percent say stress or stressful</p>
<p>events</p>
<p>20 percent say inflammation or fever 20</p>
<p>say fatigue or weakness and twenty</p>
<p>percent of the remaining twenty percent</p>
<p>of that adds up say insulin spikes any</p>
<p>uh wisdom there</p>
<p>okay so</p>
<p>we we</p>
<p>some people got it it&rsquo;s the stress and</p>
<p>uh you know in practice i would always</p>
<p>ask people this every single time and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had one person say that they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t experience stress right before</p>
<p>they got sick</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like one for one and the</p>
<p>reason for that is that</p>
<p>when you go through stress you raise</p>
<p>cortisol cortisol</p>
<p>suppresses your immune system it puts</p>
<p>the immune system on pause</p>
<p>it um</p>
<p>and this is why</p>
<p>people that have an immune system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>out of control or like a inflammatory</p>
<p>condition like cytokine storm in their</p>
<p>lungs whatever they&rsquo;re given prednisone</p>
<p>which is a synthetic cortisol</p>
<p>because it it gets rid of that immune</p>
<p>reaction</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just interesting this connection</p>
<p>between you know you go through stress</p>
<p>and then bam you get sick so apparently</p>
<p>it opens the door in fact bacteria</p>
<p>certain bacteria have a strategy</p>
<p>of activating your hypothalamus</p>
<p>in a way that will stimulate cortisol so</p>
<p>they can invade your body because they</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>your immune system shuts off when you go</p>
<p>through stress</p>
<p>so what can we learn from this we could</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>learn</p>
<p>to keep our stress low and i have a lot</p>
<p>of videos on that you should watch them</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very very important especially</p>
<p>nowadays since the motto is</p>
<p>jack up your adrenals and stay stressed</p>
<p>24 7.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right speaking of cortisol we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got another question that includes its</p>
<p>mention and here it is</p>
<p>all right what is the main mineral</p>
<p>that is lost with stress</p>
<p>when you have high cortisol what is the</p>
<p>main mineral</p>
<p>that gets excreted from the body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the next question all right dig</p>
<p>on that audience and uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see tracy from facebook i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on keto and iaf for five years and have</p>
<p>lost over 100 pounds wow</p>
<p>but lately i can&rsquo;t stop eating carbs and</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>and have put on 15 pounds uh boy she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been terrific for so long but i guess</p>
<p>sometimes the old</p>
<p>demon&rsquo;s return</p>
<p>yeah i think um i&rsquo;m glad uh</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s in the time frame of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not next to any holidays</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re right between thanksgiving and</p>
<p>christmas and uh uh</p>
<p>many other holidays so um i think the uh</p>
<p>best thing to do</p>
<p>is to um actively and aggressively</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>go through your house</p>
<p>and just make sure there&rsquo;s nothing in</p>
<p>the house that resembles a twinkie and</p>
<p>then also um</p>
<p>start making some</p>
<p>keto alternatives so you at least have</p>
<p>those as a backup so you don&rsquo;t deprive</p>
<p>yourself too much</p>
<p>i would think that</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t have anything in the house</p>
<p>though in the cupboards</p>
<p>that you would um</p>
<p>if you craved i think the tendency to</p>
<p>want to drive out to buy something would</p>
<p>be a lot less i know i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s been times where i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>searching for something and i realized</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s right i didn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any junk food in the house so</p>
<p>i guess i&rsquo;m not gonna eat junk food</p>
<p>today and then it kind of passes</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to get back on track realize that when</p>
<p>you start to get back on track then the</p>
<p>cravings go away but i think you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the in a mode where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>well your blood sugars are low and then</p>
<p>you want it the next day but</p>
<p>replace it with a keto friendly</p>
<p>alternative so</p>
<p>that way you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s something that sounds sort</p>
<p>of familiar stevie from youtube what</p>
<p>causes pain under the right rib cage it</p>
<p>goes away when i cut out sugar</p>
<p>is their relation must be</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s weird it goes away when you</p>
<p>cut out sugar that&rsquo;s uh ironic um i</p>
<p>think um it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s underneath the</p>
<p>right side it&rsquo;s going to be gall bladder</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>the one if there&rsquo;s anything that will</p>
<p>trigger your gallbladder being like in a</p>
<p>spasm or a knot it would be</p>
<p>insulin okay so the high sugar so</p>
<p>yeah i think you just need to avoid the</p>
<p>sugar and you&rsquo;ll be good to go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>barometer to know that</p>
<p>my diet is not correct if you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>under your right rib cage it&rsquo;s hurting i</p>
<p>had that for probably</p>
<p>15 years myself so i know exactly what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve seen pictures of dr berg at a</p>
<p>little more portly state and i&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you what a transition he looks younger</p>
<p>30 years later somehow so anyway how in</p>
<p>the world does that happen well listen</p>
<p>our second question</p>
<p>surgery steve not good for you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great anyway</p>
<p>no exactly all right so what is the main</p>
<p>mineral that is lost with stress and</p>
<p>high cortisol was our</p>
<p>latest question and uh the audience</p>
<p>claims 35 percent of them anyway respond</p>
<p>to say magnesium 35 percent say</p>
<p>potassium and uh the other 30</p>
<p>say zinc any winners</p>
<p>yeah the main one with cortisol okay is</p>
<p>potassium loss if you look it up uh look</p>
<p>if you want to look up more data let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just look under cushing&rsquo;s syndrome and</p>
<p>uh related to potassium you lose</p>
<p>potassium and potassium then</p>
<p>is not there so</p>
<p>the body will replace it with sodium so</p>
<p>you start getting water logged in fluid</p>
<p>retention</p>
<p>but then without potassium your heart</p>
<p>rate goes up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t sleep as well because</p>
<p>potassium is also for relaxation and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also for energy so you get tired</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>many other effects with the potassium</p>
<p>deficiency and this is why i always</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>more potassium for the average</p>
<p>individual simply because they&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>not to mention</p>
<p>carbohydrates deplete your potassium not</p>
<p>to mention not eating enough greens to</p>
<p>plate your potassium so</p>
<p>most people are deficient potassium when</p>
<p>they get enough whether they feel better</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s fantastic well uh you know a</p>
<p>question is how many people around the</p>
<p>world</p>
<p>you know enjoy a healthy lifestyle and</p>
<p>think that they can find it by tuning</p>

<p>let&rsquo;s see where are we um</p>
<p>we need to move on to our next guest and</p>
<p>when speaking of the uk</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we move on to sue who is</p>
<p>coming to us from london and if you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>unmute yourself sue you&rsquo;re on with dr</p>
<p>byrd</p>
<p>hi dr berg it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great show</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 52 years old i&rsquo;m going through</p>
<p>menopause at the moment i&rsquo;m on hrt</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following your extreme loss</p>
<p>program</p>
<p>over the last four weeks and i&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>11 pounds so far which is great</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m doing the one meal a day</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m taking the electrolyte powders the</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder the seek out</p>
<p>vitamin d and k</p>
<p>b1 nutritional yeast but when i go for</p>
<p>long walks i&rsquo;m having a problem with</p>
<p>shortness of breath</p>
<p>and i have a dry mouth</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve been trying to work out what</p>
<p>what the problem is and also it&rsquo;s worse</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m walking up a hill or going</p>
<p>upstairs so i can i&rsquo;ve become really</p>
<p>short short of breath</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t without i was just gonna ask</p>
<p>you enough i was just gonna ask you does</p>
<p>it going up with incline is it worse and</p>
<p>you just answered that yeah it&rsquo;s worse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worse my legs go heavy and i have</p>
<p>to stop at the top to just recover</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so yeah this is uh this is</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>got it</p>
<p>okay um this is what i think is going on</p>
<p>uh you mentioned this thing called</p>
<p>menopause and what&rsquo;s happening is it</p>
<p>just overloads this adrenal gland and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what your experience because if</p>
<p>the adrenal gland</p>
<p>is not backing up things especially one</p>
<p>of the biggest</p>
<p>clues of adrenal issue is</p>
<p>getting out of breath when you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>an incline</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>mountain climbing is probably not the</p>
<p>best option for you right now</p>
<p>um maybe in a few months</p>
<p>and then also um</p>
<p>if you get up too quickly if you get</p>
<p>dizzy that&rsquo;s another thing because your</p>
<p>just body is not adapting</p>
<p>so i think um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things i would look at</p>
<p>one is to support the adrenals directly</p>
<p>with some some good adaptogens and</p>
<p>nutrition that they need and i have a</p>
<p>lot of data on that you can check that</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>and then also um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you found my</p>
<p>video on the stress um</p>
<p>technique of extracting stress it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a technique you can do on yourself</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just kind of like a self massage or</p>
<p>someone could do it on you i created a</p>
<p>whole</p>
<p>video on that you should look that up i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called the stress webinar</p>
<p>i will release a</p>
<p>a link</p>
<p>associated with another video this week</p>
<p>but that would be something you can work</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>and um you&rsquo;re actually extracting</p>
<p>different places of stress on your body</p>
<p>and it really helps your sleep so i</p>
<p>think with you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how you sleep now but</p>
<p>getting that sleep perfected is going to</p>
<p>be really improving your reci recharging</p>
<p>effect do recovery</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>do you have any sleep problems</p>
<p>i did</p>
<p>but now i&rsquo;m taking the estrogen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made that better</p>
<p>but okay it&rsquo;s good the only problem is</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s just the walking and the</p>
<p>breathing that i&rsquo;m just a bit worried</p>
<p>about so i don&rsquo;t know who to go see a</p>
<p>medical doctor maybe get it checked out</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>does it take long because i&rsquo;ve only been</p>
<p>on it for four weeks do i wait wait a</p>
<p>bit longer</p>
<p>and see how it goes uh well i i would um</p>
<p>definitely uh</p>
<p>wait a little bit longer and try</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t involve maybe invasive but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple other things you can do</p>
<p>too to get more oxygen right off the bat</p>
<p>is if you take a really good vitamin e</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m talking about the tocotrienols</p>
<p>and the reason for that is that if you</p>
<p>look at the top of any mountain top</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see empty bottles of vitamin e</p>
<p>because it increases</p>
<p>oxygen</p>
<p>and so along with omega-3 too but mainly</p>
<p>the vitamin e with in that form will</p>
<p>help you with the oxygen</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would do there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of other things but i think that</p>
<p>would be important and then one last</p>
<p>thing with breathing okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i have noticed</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s ph is off their breathing</p>
<p>will be off and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>little side thing to try but</p>
<p>for the fun of it before you go on a</p>
<p>walk sometimes just take some calcium</p>
<p>maybe calcium magnesium and see if your</p>
<p>breathing isn&rsquo;t better if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case then that gives us a clue on</p>
<p>you know what her ph is off and</p>
<p>um she might need a little bit of</p>
<p>calcium and i usually like to take that</p>
<p>before bed because</p>
<p>if your ph is off that will create a</p>
<p>lack of</p>
<p>wind or air coming through the body</p>
<p>right okay that&rsquo;s great that&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>things to try thank you let us know yeah</p>
<p>okay sure brilliant thank you let&rsquo;s beg</p>
<p>good luck sue in the uk we appreciate</p>
<p>that and let&rsquo;s move on to our next</p>
<p>question and i&rsquo;m scared to try to</p>
<p>pronounce this dr berg so i&rsquo;ll let you</p>
<p>do it</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>which food contains the highest</p>
<p>concentrations of glutathione</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the next question</p>
<p>uh glutathione by the way is a</p>
<p>powerful</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>antioxidant that our body needs it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>main one</p>
<p>and our body makes it and also you can</p>
<p>get it from foods and it helps to</p>
<p>counter in fact</p>
<p>people that take tylenol</p>
<p>in large doses and accidentally destroy</p>
<p>the liver do so because it depletes</p>
<p>glutathione if you have enough</p>
<p>glutathione</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t nearly have the complications</p>
<p>from all these chronic diseases so</p>
<p>it might be a good idea</p>
<p>to know about the key food that has the</p>
<p>most glutathione</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m guessing that priscilla from</p>
<p>facebook just heard sue&rsquo;s conversation</p>
<p>with you wants to know what&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>form of vitamin e to take i guess you</p>
<p>climb up mount everest and look what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in those bottles</p>
<p>yeah the best form of vitamin e</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>tocatrinals okay tocatrinos uh just find</p>
<p>something i would not recommend getting</p>
<p>it with</p>
<p>tocopherols</p>
<p>i would not mix those why because they</p>
<p>compete with each other</p>
<p>and uh tocatrinos is like 50 times</p>
<p>stronger and it</p>
<p>it does more cleanup of free radical</p>
<p>damage</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>tocopherols will work but it&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>nearly as strong as the toe katrinas</p>
<p>interesting okay shar m as all we have</p>
<p>uh from youtube wants to know if you</p>
<p>would consider offering your electrolyte</p>
<p>formula in tablets would that would that</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>you know i</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny you say that i am actually</p>
<p>working on that right now so yes we will</p>
<p>be coming out with that because um that</p>
<p>way we can um</p>
<p>we can take out the sweetener we can</p>
<p>take out the flavoring</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll be less expensive and also</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>we can cram more electrolytes in a</p>
<p>tablet so</p>
<p>yeah it says we are working on that</p>
<p>right now um</p>
<p>and i just want to let everyone know too</p>
<p>about the electrolytes there are</p>
<p>copycats out there but i will say that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all our raw materials are very high</p>
<p>quality they don&rsquo;t come from china or</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>countries that are have questionable</p>
<p>ingredients and i will say that a lot of</p>
<p>these other companies</p>
<p>do have questionable ingredients so um</p>
<p>that is just a side note</p>
<p>all right wonderful marlon from youtube</p>
<p>how long will consuming apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar and betaine hydrochloride before</p>
<p>they fix my excess stomach acid she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t tell us how long she&rsquo;d been on it</p>
<p>but what do you say doc</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>you should see a change within a couple</p>
<p>days if you take enough some people</p>
<p>especially when they start out</p>
<p>need to take five six seven of those</p>
<p>tablets with each meal for it to work</p>
<p>one or two might not be enough</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that is the key thing about that point</p>
<p>all right and there&rsquo;s a lot of questions</p>
<p>from both facebook and youtube</p>
<p>kind of asking how can i prepare myself</p>
<p>to have a better immune system certainly</p>
<p>from covert but some of them just asked</p>
<p>for coals and flu</p>
<p>well we already gave you the biggest</p>
<p>thing right off the bat is just and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real easy thing to solve just to avoid</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>and being sarcastic but but stress is</p>
<p>the big thing and then to reduce your</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you want to do</p>
<p>physical work outside that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>way to get rid of stress or or exercise</p>
<p>but physical work is the best way to get</p>
<p>rid of mental stress</p>
<p>um and then the other thing is to</p>
<p>sleep longer which will help if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing physical stress work around the</p>
<p>house</p>
<p>or outside and then vitamin d</p>
<p>is the most important vitamin and the</p>
<p>most important mineral is</p>
<p>zinc</p>
<p>both of those are protective against</p>
<p>microorganisms especially viral in</p>
<p>nature</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s quite a few other things</p>
<p>like vitamin c</p>
<p>but if you take a look at</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>where people have problems is</p>
<p>you know people get more um</p>
<p>i guess influenced by viruses if their</p>
<p>own health</p>
<p>is compromised with metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>so the more you can</p>
<p>go back to what i&rsquo;ve been saying for the</p>
<p>last you know 10 years</p>
<p>healthy keto intermittent fasting</p>
<p>the less effect that even getting the</p>
<p>virus is going to have on your body</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>periodically prolonged</p>
<p>can basically give you a new immune</p>
<p>system so that would be something that</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t neglect the fasting very</p>
<p>very important with your immune system</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>then if you add that to everything else</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in really good shape</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s fantastic and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>speaking of good shape uh would you read</p>
<p>that for us again doctor i&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>answers what what foods contain the</p>
<p>highest what food contains the highest</p>
<p>concentration</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>glutathione right well our resident</p>
<p>geniuses out there in the world 30 of</p>
<p>them say</p>
<p>uh cruciferous vegetables 25 say beef</p>
<p>liver in specific 25 leafy green</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>10 say lemons and 10 say</p>
<p>moringa did i say that right now</p>
<p>okay so everyone is correct on</p>
<p>glutathione but the food that has the</p>
<p>most is mushrooms</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>oh nobody got that</p>
<p>specific and specifically uh i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s porcini uh it&rsquo;s actually porce</p>
<p>yeah persini mushrooms</p>
<p>um have the most and there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>mushrooms that are</p>
<p>very very high in glutathione but um</p>
<p>mushrooms are just a fascinating food</p>
<p>that i think we don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>much about anymore i mean</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>emphasize mushrooms for health as much</p>
<p>as they should because there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>really cool things in mushrooms</p>
<p>especially for</p>
<p>cognitive function and especially for</p>
<p>your immune system</p>
<p>and even anti-cancer i will be doing</p>
<p>more videos on that but like the turkey</p>
<p>tail mushroom i mean amazing for</p>
<p>cognitive improvement and anti-cancer</p>
<p>so i will do a video on that but</p>
<p>glutathione</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget the mushroom steve</p>
<p>right now speaking of which can you cook</p>
<p>them up really good i love them when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all mushy</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yeah you should uh you should cook them</p>
<p>but uh also put them on your salad but</p>
<p>yeah some sauteed mushrooms with butter</p>
<p>uh that would be a good thing</p>
<p>all right well that&rsquo;s fantastic okay</p>
<p>teresa</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see from facebook how long do</p>
<p>you have to fast to reset your immune</p>
<p>system i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like what we talked about</p>
<p>to create a really big significant</p>
<p>effect on your immune system to the</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;re just generating stem</p>
<p>cells new stem cells from your bone</p>
<p>marrow</p>
<p>it takes like 72 hours okay</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>going 18 hours uh in</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>six-hour eating window with 18 hours of</p>
<p>fasting you can still create a really</p>
<p>nice effect on your immune system but</p>
<p>the prolonged fasting is where you get</p>
<p>real amazing improvements even to the</p>
<p>point of</p>
<p>if someone has cancer and someone is</p>
<p>doing chemo and radiation</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>the fasting will enhance those effects</p>
<p>and minimize the side effect from those</p>
<p>two treatments</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>fasting has some</p>
<p>i will be releasing a video tomorrow</p>
<p>morning</p>
<p>on cancer and fasting so you want to see</p>
<p>this because i put a lot of time into it</p>
<p>and then also um i will release another</p>
<p>video next week on</p>
<p>some amazing new things with fasting as</p>
<p>far as new studies that</p>
<p>go into how they affect your genes i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>mind-blowing what fasting can do so</p>
<p>whoever&rsquo;s doing fasting is</p>
<p>doing something that&rsquo;s very beneficial</p>
<p>to their health and if you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>fasting watch more videos on that</p>
<p>fantastic well i&rsquo;m really proud of our</p>
<p>audience we are moving so quickly</p>
<p>through our questions that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get to all of them here&rsquo;s the next</p>

<p>mobile all right good morning</p>
<p>roll tide</p>
<p>we just won the iron bowl by the way</p>
<p>wow you guys always</p>
<p>always</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your question for dr berg</p>
<p>so my question for you dr berg is um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been on the ketogenic since like</p>
<p>the middle of october</p>
<p>and i started losing inches right away</p>
<p>my issue right now is the scale has only</p>
<p>moved for me like five and a half pounds</p>
<p>and i have not</p>
<p>lost any more weight but i continue to</p>
<p>lose the inches and i&rsquo;ve gone back</p>
<p>through um when i went through your</p>
<p>health coach training recently i went</p>
<p>back through some of the videos to try</p>
<p>to find</p>
<p>how do i tweak this what do i do so i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tweaked</p>
<p>and you know the proteins the fats the</p>
<p>carbs i&rsquo;ve even gotten rid of the</p>
<p>blackberries and raspberries because i</p>
<p>you know i love fruit</p>
<p>and i even sacrificed those for a little</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;ve extended the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting i&rsquo;ve gone as far as 22 hours</p>
<p>like a few days</p>
<p>um but i&rsquo;m still not moving the scale so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m and i&rsquo;m also doing your supplements</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing the gallbladder support</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p>
<p>anymore and so that helps</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still not moving the scale so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wanting to know what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m missing what i&rsquo;m not doing</p>
<p>that is preventing me from actually</p>
<p>seeing the numbers change</p>
<p>got it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>are you</p>
<p>pre-menopausal or anything connected to</p>
<p>menopause</p>
<p>since</p>
<p>44 and i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m almost 60. so i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>wow yeah</p>
<p>i i thought you were in your 40s um oh</p>
<p>well thank you so much</p>
<p>growth hormone baby</p>
<p>increasing</p>
<p>but yeah yeah i&rsquo;ve dealt with that for</p>
<p>years</p>
<p>so i think this is my feeling on what</p>
<p>you said not going into details i think</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think this is a big</p>
<p>problem of things that you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>or things that you should be doing</p>
<p>i think it is normal for a lot of people</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>especially post menopausal okay</p>
<p>you have um atrophy that just happens it</p>
<p>was because of years of cortisol</p>
<p>and then to get that back</p>
<p>takes</p>
<p>quite some time it does it really does</p>
<p>even with my wife</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>it does happen there&rsquo;s other things you</p>
<p>can speed it up but the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shrinking tells me that it is working so</p>
<p>the worst thing to do is think wow i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not working i&rsquo;m doing something</p>
<p>wrong when it actually is working and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like getting healthy first</p>
<p>right you have to go through that</p>
<p>process right yes</p>
<p>what you could do</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re doing like you said all</p>
<p>these things is start to add in some</p>
<p>heavier</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>higher intensity not not terribly</p>
<p>frequent okay if you add that um that</p>
<p>just kicks it in the butt and it can</p>
<p>actually speed things up</p>
<p>um the other thing the other thing to do</p>
<p>is maybe once a month</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you can do 72 hours but</p>
<p>that would really kick</p>
<p>that insulin resistance in the butt and</p>
<p>really speed things up as well but um</p>
<p>and then work on your sleep</p>
<p>and stress but i think you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through a normal phase which you have to</p>
<p>just give it a little more time but</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t take that as a loss at all</p>
<p>awesome and that&rsquo;s very encouraging yeah</p>
<p>my sleep has been tremendous since i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing this i mean i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>wonderful so but i appreciate it i will</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve definitely considered doing a</p>
<p>72-hour fast and i&rsquo;m working my way up</p>
<p>to like 48 hours so i&rsquo;m baby steps</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll get there i&rsquo;ll get there well thank</p>
<p>you so much you&rsquo;re welcome well i tell</p>
<p>you those people from alabama sure can</p>
<p>brag about their college football they</p>
<p>always just beat the heck out of</p>
<p>everybody i&rsquo;m telling you auburn is our</p>
<p>nemesis and</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t win last year but we sure did</p>
<p>kick some booty this year so i think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to georgia georgia bulldogs</p>
<p>is our next all right good for you good</p>
<p>luck alabamians who who like that</p>
<p>particular team all right let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s answer a question dr berg where</p>
<p>like i say we&rsquo;re going to get through to</p>
<p>it and we i&rsquo;ll go ahead it&rsquo;s so short</p>
<p>your liver makes hormones and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>real battle in the audience where 90</p>
<p>percent say that it&rsquo;s true and 10 are</p>
<p>digging in to say it&rsquo;s false who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s totally true it</p>
<p>it makes quite a few hormones uh in fact</p>
<p>all of the</p>
<p>hormones</p>
<p>that are steroids or they call them sex</p>
<p>hormones like estrogen progesterone</p>
<p>testosterone</p>
<p>cortisol</p>
<p>80 of the cortisol flowing through your</p>
<p>bloodstream right now originates as a</p>
<p>created hormone in your liver and the</p>
<p>reason why</p>
<p>it originates in your liver is because</p>
<p>your liver makes cholesterol and things</p>
<p>that come from cholesterol so your body</p>
<p>takes cholesterol it makes it and then</p>
<p>it uses it for raw material to build</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>which is considered a hormone by the way</p>
<p>these other hormones that i just</p>
<p>mentioned</p>
<p>and bile salts by the way that&rsquo;s just as</p>
<p>a side note but yeah your your liver and</p>
<p>it also um</p>
<p>buffers</p>
<p>um these hormones so if there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>of a certain hormone the liver is</p>
<p>supposed to buffer it and this is why</p>
<p>people that have a fatty liver or a bad</p>
<p>liver they have a lot of hormone issues</p>
<p>in fact</p>
<p>the liver is intimately involved with</p>
<p>the conversion of the thyroid hormones</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>the liver makes</p>
<p>another hormone which is an extension of</p>
<p>growth hormone called igf insulin-like</p>
<p>growth factor number one</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>growth hormone that&rsquo;s the anti-aging</p>
<p>comes down from the pituitary it works</p>
<p>through the liver and then it manifests</p>
<p>a lot of its functions through</p>
<p>this additional hormone igf number one</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>huge effects on hormones and also</p>
<p>creating different hormones so uh so the</p>
<p>model of this the</p>
<p>story is there the lessons of this is to</p>
<p>take care of your liver steve</p>
<p>no kidding don&rsquo;t neglect your liver</p>
<p>well i hate to tell you i i had hep c</p>
<p>for my misspent youth and i got uh</p>
<p>miraculously healed not always into the</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals but harvoni has pretty</p>
<p>much wiped out hepatitis c from the</p>
<p>world and my liver recovered and it was</p>
<p>in bad shape so i&rsquo;m very grateful to</p>
<p>hear all the great things the liver does</p>
<p>and now mine&rsquo;s back in action</p>
<p>and that is terrific and uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>how about bianca from youtube why does</p>
<p>this sounds like an assumption why does</p>
<p>keto and intermittent fasting create</p>
<p>insulin resistance and underweight</p>
<p>people will the insulin resistance</p>
<p>subside</p>
<p>with a refeeding of carbs</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s completely uh false</p>
<p>information um going on a keto</p>
<p>immunofasting if you&rsquo;re thin does not</p>
<p>cause intermittent or insulin resistance</p>
<p>at all that&rsquo;s not true and then</p>
<p>refeeding</p>
<p>carbs will make things worse not better</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re adding more</p>
<p>glucose more insulin and if you take a</p>
<p>look at the mechanism of what causes</p>
<p>insulin resistance</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>excessive amounts of insulin</p>
<p>that causes it not</p>
<p>a lessening amount of insulin so</p>
<p>i think i would just study the videos on</p>
<p>insulin resistance a bit more so you can</p>
<p>understand that the mechanism of how it</p>
<p>really works</p>
<p>all right how about some more rumors</p>
<p>then lanie&rsquo;s from youtube i&rsquo;ve read that</p>
<p>hashimoto&rsquo;s patient should avoid keto is</p>
<p>that true</p>
<p>another piece of false information no no</p>
<p>no what are you going to do go on the</p>
<p>high carb diet no you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>that one of the worst things</p>
<p>to do</p>
<p>if you have hashimoto&rsquo;s is to</p>
<p>do carbs especially grains especially</p>
<p>gluten gluten is a</p>
<p>serious bad thing for hashimoto&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>but hashimoto&rsquo;s is an autoimmune issue</p>
<p>it starts in the gut</p>
<p>and then it creates all sorts of other</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an immune issue and</p>
<p>this is why fasting intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is very important in hashimoto&rsquo;s as well</p>
<p>as vitamin d because they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>um but no keto is very very good for</p>
<p>hashimoto&rsquo;s well that&rsquo;s fantastic and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to frank from san mateo</p>
<p>but first let&rsquo;s throw out the last</p>
<p>question of the day</p>
<p>all right what has the most</p>
<p>anti-cancer effect out of all the things</p>
<p>that is anti-cancer what creates the</p>
<p>biggest anti-cancer effect</p>
<p>okay dig into that audience everything</p>
<p>else all right and let&rsquo;s see how about</p>
<p>frank you&rsquo;re on with dr burke how about</p>
<p>your one question for us</p>
<p>all right thank you very much first i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to say thank you very much for</p>
<p>everything that you do</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;ve watched many many many of your</p>
<p>videos uh discovered you about seven</p>
<p>months ago or so so been very very</p>
<p>helpful</p>
<p>awesome thank you yeah very good</p>
<p>so um a couple a little over two years</p>
<p>ago</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>got a blood infection and it developed</p>
<p>an abscess on my spine</p>
<p>uh needless to say the pain was just</p>
<p>unbelievable but i wound up spending a</p>
<p>week in the hospital and six more weeks</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>antibiotic treatment from it</p>
<p>um the problem is is that i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>really fully recovered from it</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>my the best that i can</p>
<p>can come up with is i i believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from the abscess</p>
<p>is i have a protruding disc in my spine</p>
<p>and my neurologist</p>
<p>tells me</p>
<p>based on some certain symptoms there are</p>
<p>certain things that i do he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sure that that&rsquo;s causing my back pain or</p>
<p>not but i have</p>
<p>a pretty pretty strong lower back pain</p>
<p>especially</p>
<p>if i</p>
<p>exercise or i</p>
<p>do like strenuous work or something like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>it can get very very painful</p>
<p>so you know i&rsquo;ve been on i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following the keto diet for about seven</p>
<p>months i&rsquo;ve lost probably 20 to 23</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>i still have a ways to go</p>
<p>plateauing is a little bit of an issue</p>
<p>and not being able to exercise</p>
<p>also i think</p>
<p>prohibits that errors is is causing some</p>
<p>of the plateaus</p>
<p>but uh anyway i guess uh you know part</p>
<p>of your chiropractic do you have any</p>
<p>advice on</p>
<p>the protruding</p>
<p>disc</p>
<p>he my neurologist gave me a couple of</p>
<p>different options</p>
<p>one of them being surgery to remove the</p>
<p>protrusion</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not really keen on doing research</p>
<p>the surgery i would rather like a more</p>
<p>holistic repair for it but i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s possible do you have any</p>
<p>advice</p>
<p>you know um</p>
<p>you mentioned abscess right in absence</p>
<p>of your spine yes</p>
<p>so do you have an abscess and a</p>
<p>protruded disc or</p>
<p>no i think that the the protruding disc</p>
<p>is it was caused by the abscess</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>interesting um i i did release a video</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>discs um fairly recently you can look</p>
<p>that up but there are some things you</p>
<p>can try</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you can find um</p>
<p>someone in your area that has what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called a cox table</p>
<p>which is a</p>
<p>flexion distraction</p>
<p>in fact i bought one for myself</p>
<p>in my own house but it</p>
<p>the table drops and it really is</p>
<p>wonderful on</p>
<p>doing some serious traction and flexion</p>
<p>of your lower back to open up that disc</p>
<p>to allow anything that is kind of a like</p>
<p>a jelly donut to come back into that</p>
<p>center of the</p>
<p>donut</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s definitely something i</p>
<p>would try it&rsquo;s very gentle and it um</p>
<p>it could relieve a lot of back pain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something i would do um i also</p>
<p>talked about um</p>
<p>in this video that you&rsquo;ll watch</p>
<p>um some other things to take like um</p>
<p>a lot of the pain</p>
<p>that people have in their lower back is</p>
<p>not even the protrusion it&rsquo;s the nerve</p>
<p>endings in the disc itself</p>
<p>and so i recommend a series of things</p>
<p>which i you might be doing some already</p>
<p>like vitamin d and high levels of</p>
<p>vitamin d maybe up to like 30 000 or</p>
<p>40 000 iu&rsquo;s a day</p>
<p>and see if that helps i&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>40 000</p>
<p>okay good of your of your d3 and k2</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then the other thing is that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing all these things</p>
<p>and also if you sit a lot that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>terrible for the disc i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you should be on a computer all day like</p>
<p>i used to but that&rsquo;s another factor that</p>
<p>i would recommend a really good exercise</p>
<p>to stabilize disc problems</p>
<p>is to support the glutes and the</p>
<p>hamstring</p>
<p>with walking backwards as an</p>
<p>exercise um if you go in the park or</p>
<p>something go and go to a place where you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t trip or anyone can see you because</p>
<p>it looks kind of weird but walking</p>
<p>backwards strengthens a lot of the</p>
<p>muscles that put stability in your lower</p>
<p>back</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you did all those things</p>
<p>right and</p>
<p>the pain is just unbearable there are</p>
<p>there are surgeries now that are</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>minimally invasive</p>
<p>that can use sonic</p>
<p>sound waves and go in there and maybe</p>
<p>clip out some of the discs i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>opposed to that if if you&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>everything else um</p>
<p>um because if that protrusions is</p>
<p>sitting out there hanging in the breeze</p>
<p>waiting to just you know just press on</p>
<p>your nerve it can make your life a</p>
<p>living hell so um but i think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still things you can do and</p>
<p>but definitely watch my video on that as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>okay very good well again thank you very</p>
<p>much you&rsquo;re awesome and uh what you do</p>
<p>i appreciate that thanks thanks so much</p>
<p>frank for joining the show and uh we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all very proud here in the booth because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotten to every question and the</p>
<p>final question</p>
<p>uh for today&rsquo;s show doc was as follows</p>
<p>what has the most any cancer</p>
<p>effect and our audience claims at least</p>
<p>65 say fasting or extended fasting 30</p>
<p>say eliminating carbs and sugar that</p>
<p>sounds like a good idea and 5 say garlic</p>
<p>and turmeric turmeric i think i said</p>
<p>that right</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and the answer is</p>
<p>fasting fasting and the more i look into</p>
<p>the fasting the more i look at the</p>
<p>research which is getting becoming more</p>
<p>and more um</p>
<p>i mean there is some seriously powerful</p>
<p>effects that fasting can do now one</p>
<p>interesting thing that i will talk about</p>
<p>in my video that i&rsquo;m going to release</p>
<p>tomorrow</p>
<p>is that unfortunately well before i say</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting i think is the best way to</p>
<p>prevent</p>
<p>cancer</p>
<p>but once you have it unfortunately</p>
<p>ketones can</p>
<p>act as a raw material to feed some of</p>
<p>the membranes around the cancer cells so</p>
<p>what can you do i mean what about</p>
<p>fasting fasting produces way more</p>
<p>ketones than a low fat diet or low low</p>
<p>carb diet</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the epigenetic effect of fasting</p>
<p>overrides that mechanism</p>
<p>and it just turns off</p>
<p>all these genes</p>
<p>that express with cancer and it</p>
<p>activates</p>
<p>the genes that are anti-cancer i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so many different things so i</p>
<p>will be talking about that tomorrow um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you want to prevent</p>
<p>that issue or you want something to do</p>
<p>def definitely do a</p>
<p>deep dive into fasting and just</p>
<p>apply that as a tool because i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>powerful tool that you can do</p>
<p>um because it increases your survival</p>
<p>which is very</p>
<p>counter-intuitive you would think that</p>
<p>if i</p>
<p>i need to nourish my body no you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you need to fast and then your body</p>
<p>becomes a lot stronger</p>
<p>the only catch the only problem with</p>
<p>fasting is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re too frail and thin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more difficult but i have</p>
<p>another solution for that i will talk</p>
<p>about that tomorrow if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>if you have a little more weight</p>
<p>to lose</p>
<p>that would be a perfect</p>
<p>option for you to start doing fasting</p>
<p>to get the benefits</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s fantastic okay so cheating</p>
<p>as he calls himself on um youtube says</p>
<p>he lost a kilogram so i guess that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple of pounds in one week by doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting wants to know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just water weight or fats or if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to tell it&rsquo;s hard to tell</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re losing you know a lot of</p>
<p>weight initially it&rsquo;s probably water</p>
<p>weight but the the most that someone can</p>
<p>lose if they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>low carb and keto</p>
<p>is probably up to a little over 2.2</p>
<p>pounds at the very most that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best case scenario on average</p>
<p>a person will lose a pound of actual fat</p>
<p>anything more than that is going to be</p>
<p>more water weight</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and then some days some weeks you might</p>
<p>not lose anything but you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>shrinking in size because you are you</p>
<p>have to heal these um</p>
<p>muscles that have been atrophied and</p>
<p>these proteins that are replacing</p>
<p>or repairing things are a bit heavier if</p>
<p>you compare it to fat</p>
<p>and you keep the same volume</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s fantastic well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go over some videos that you got</p>
<p>coming up doc here&rsquo;s a brief list and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got some more</p>
<p>fasting is your best strategy against</p>
<p>cancer that will be released tomorrow</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>have you had gallbladder surgery that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the title is going to be um</p>
<p>a little bit different but i will</p>
<p>release that on sunday the one on</p>
<p>gallbladder surgery and also if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know if you already have the surgery</p>
<p>what do you do um</p>
<p>that this i mean</p>
<p>there are so many people that have</p>
<p>gallbladder problems that don&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>and then they get the surgery and they</p>
<p>have complications and they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to do</p>
<p>there are so many things you can do and</p>
<p>why do i do the question is why do i do</p>
<p>so many videos on the gallbladder simply</p>
<p>because i had this problem for years and</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know what to do and i suffered</p>
<p>i wish i would have known what to do</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of things you can do</p>
<p>if you have gallbladder symptoms or even</p>
<p>if you have the surgery</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>yeah and then stay tuned for additional</p>
<p>videos i&rsquo;m not gonna let&rsquo;s see um how to</p>
<p>fix frequent irrigation i already</p>
<p>already released that</p>
<p>so i released that two days ago</p>
<p>so um i&rsquo;m going to keep everyone in</p>
<p>mystery on these other videos that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to release next week how about</p>
<p>that steve all right it sounds great</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you what i am fascinated when</p>
<p>i see you pop a video up how quickly it</p>
<p>gains views i tell you people are</p>
<p>getting a lot out of them i mean</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people an hour</p>
<p>start to pile on these so obviously you</p>
<p>are hitting ringing the bell for people</p>
<p>around the world because they are really</p>
<p>interested</p>
<p>in your various videos as am i and lori</p>
<p>as you know got her gallbladder hacked</p>
<p>out and so we&rsquo;ll definitely be looking</p>
<p>for that to see</p>
<p>um you know as you said you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not always better roses once you do you</p>
<p>expect that you&rsquo;re going to feel better</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden you end up with</p>
<p>more problems so that&rsquo;s uh well i just</p>
<p>want i want to mention one thing about</p>
<p>the gallbladder when you have it removed</p>
<p>see the whole goal that people have is</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>just minimize their symptoms of usually</p>
<p>gallstones right they want to minimize</p>
<p>the symptoms but</p>
<p>but the bile</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re now going to be deficient</p>
<p>in goes way beyond just your symptoms of</p>
<p>pain and tightness i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to cover all the different</p>
<p>purposes of why you need bile and</p>
<p>and the purpose of the gallbladder is to</p>
<p>concentrate that bile and so if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that concentration</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going to get the quantity</p>
<p>of bile needed to do its job and then</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>the significance of that and the</p>
<p>importance of that and things that you</p>
<p>would never in a million years think are</p>
<p>connected to a deficiency of bile um you</p>
<p>might associate with something else so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about increasing knowledge and</p>
<p>understanding about your health</p>
<p>so you can be more in control of your</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>all right well that sounds terrific</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see latisha is asking a question</p>
<p>that many people have just we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>sure out here doc what oils or fats are</p>
<p>good and what aren&rsquo;t and she&rsquo;s asking</p>
<p>about avocado oil she wants to know if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good or bad and maybe you can</p>
<p>just go through a little list because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all confused</p>
<p>avocado oil is is</p>
<p>really really good for you in fact it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for your skin</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good even to apply topically but uh</p>
<p>avocados have um</p>
<p>huge effects on as anti-inflammatory as</p>
<p>blood sugar</p>
<p>issues and then as well as</p>
<p>supporting the liver it has</p>
<p>liver protective</p>
<p>properties so</p>
<p>it can it&rsquo;s another food that can</p>
<p>greatly increase your glutathione so</p>
<p>if you want good liver support and guess</p>
<p>what you only need like one avocado per</p>
<p>week to create these significant effects</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s really cool and um</p>
<p>so if you eat avocado it&rsquo;s like your the</p>
<p>benefits extend way beyond the time of</p>
<p>eating an avocado so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily have to eat one avocado a</p>
<p>day to keep the doctor away</p>
<p>all right well we don&rsquo;t want to keep the</p>
<p>doctor away but we&rsquo;re about to wrap up</p>
<p>and uh let&rsquo;s see adele he&rsquo;s not here</p>
<p>from sydney he kept popping off and on</p>
<p>he had terrible internet so adil you</p>
<p>either try to come in next week or i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>look for your question on youtube or</p>
<p>facebook and see what you had to say</p>
<p>from sydney so we&rsquo;re sorry that that uh</p>
<p>the vagaries of the internet kept us for</p>
<p>asking your question but otherwise we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>out of time doc you want to uh take us</p>
<p>out in the usual fashion oh my goodness</p>
<p>not until we see the goat this</p>
<p>this uh it&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s not a dog he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>goat</p>
<p>baby billy</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>rambunctious um he&rsquo;s our new mascot he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really cute he&rsquo;s very cute and um if you</p>
<p>guys ever wanted to look for a pet um</p>
<p>you should probably consider a dwarf</p>
<p>goat</p>
<p>um they stay this small and uh no he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get a little bit a little bit bigger oh</p>
<p>my god he&rsquo;s too cute</p>
<p>and i will see you</p>
<p>next week all right</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
