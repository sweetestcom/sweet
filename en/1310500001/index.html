    <p>As part of MIT course 6S099, Artificial General Intelligence,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to sit down with Max Tegmark.</p>
<p>He is a professor here at MIT.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a physicist, spent a large part of his career</p>
<p>studying the mysteries of our cosmological universe.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s also studied and delved into the beneficial</p>
<p>possibilities and the existential risks</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Amongst many other things, he is the cofounder</p>
<p>of the Future of Life Institute, author of two books,</p>
<p>both of which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>First, Our Mathematical Universe.</p>
<p>Second is Life 3.0.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s truly an out of the box thinker and a fun personality,</p>
<p>so I really enjoy talking to him.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see more of these videos in the future,</p>
<p>please subscribe and also click the little bell icon</p>
<p>to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss any videos.</p>
<p>Also, Twitter, LinkedIn, agi.mit.edu</p>
<p>if you wanna watch other lectures</p>
<p>or conversations like this one.</p>
<p>Better yet, go read Max&rsquo;s book, Life 3.0.</p>
<p>Chapter seven on goals is my favorite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really where philosophy and engineering come together</p>
<p>and it opens with a quote by Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive</p>
<p>but in finding something to live for.</p>
<p>Lastly, I believe that every failure rewards us</p>
<p>with an opportunity to learn</p>
<p>and in that sense, I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate</p>
<p>to fail in so many new and exciting ways</p>
<p>and this conversation was no different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned about something called</p>
<p>radio frequency interference, RFI, look it up.</p>
<p>Apparently, music and conversations</p>
<p>from local radio stations can bleed into the audio</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re recording in such a way</p>
<p>that it almost completely ruins that audio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exceptionally difficult sound source to remove.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve gotten the opportunity to learn</p>
<p>how to avoid RFI in the future during recording sessions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also gotten the opportunity to learn</p>
<p>how to use Adobe Audition and iZotope RX 6</p>
<p>to do some noise, some audio repair.</p>
<p>Of course, this is an exceptionally difficult noise</p>
<p>to remove.</p>
<p>I am an engineer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an audio engineer.</p>
<p>Neither is anybody else in our group</p>
<p>but we did our best.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I thank you for your patience</p>
<p>and I hope you&rsquo;re still able to enjoy this conversation.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life</p>
<p>out there in the universe?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s open up with an easy question.</p>
<p>I have a minority view here actually.</p>
<p>When I give public lectures, I often ask for a show of hands</p>
<p>who thinks there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there somewhere else</p>
<p>and almost everyone put their hands up</p>
<p>and when I ask why, they&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s so many galaxies out there, there&rsquo;s gotta be.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a numbers nerd, right?</p>
<p>So when you look more carefully at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so clear at all.</p>
<p>When we talk about our universe, first of all,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t mean all of space.</p>
<p>We actually mean, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you can throw me the universe if you want,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s behind you there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we simply mean the spherical region of space</p>
<p>from which light has a time to reach us so far</p>
<p>during the 14.8 billion year,</p>
<p>13.8 billion years since our Big Bang.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more space here but this is what we call a universe</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s all we have access to.</p>
<p>So is there intelligent life here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotten to the point of building telescopes</p>
<p>and computers?</p>
<p>My guess is no, actually.</p>
<p>The probability of it happening on any given planet</p>
<p>is some number we don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>And what we do know is that the number can&rsquo;t be super high</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s over a billion Earth like planets</p>
<p>in the Milky Way galaxy alone,</p>
<p>many of which are billions of years older than Earth.</p>
<p>And aside from some UFO believers,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t much evidence</p>
<p>that any superduran civilization has come here at all.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the famous Fermi paradox, right?</p>
<p>And then if you work the numbers,</p>
<p>what you find is that if you have no clue</p>
<p>what the probability is of getting life on a given planet,</p>
<p>so it could be 10 to the minus 10, 10 to the minus 20,</p>
<p>or 10 to the minus two, or any power of 10</p>
<p>is sort of equally likely</p>
<p>if you wanna be really open minded,</p>
<p>that translates into it being equally likely</p>
<p>that our nearest neighbor is 10 to the 16 meters away,</p>
<p>10 to the 17 meters away, 10 to the 18.</p>
<p>By the time you get much less than 10 to the 16 already,</p>
<p>we pretty much know there is nothing else that close.</p>
<p>And when you get beyond 10.</p>
<p>Because they would have discovered us.</p>
<p>Yeah, they would have been discovered as long ago,</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re really close,</p>
<p>we would have probably noted some engineering projects</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s beyond 10 to the 26 meters,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already outside of here.</p>
<p>So my guess is actually that we are the only life in here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotten the point of building advanced tech,</p>
<p>which I think is very,</p>
<p>puts a lot of responsibility on our shoulders, not screw up.</p>
<p>I think people who take for granted</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s okay for us to screw up,</p>
<p>have an accidental nuclear war or go extinct somehow</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a sort of Star Trek like situation out there</p>
<p>where some other life forms are gonna come and bail us out</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter as much.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re leveling us into a false sense of security.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s much more prudent to say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be really grateful</p>
<p>for this amazing opportunity we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>and make the best of it just in case it is down to us.</p>
<p>So from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>do you think intelligent life,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s unique from a sort of statistical view</p>
<p>of the size of the universe,</p>
<p>but from the basic matter of the universe,</p>
<p>how difficult is it for intelligent life to come about?</p>
<p>The kind of advanced tech building life</p>
<p>is implied in your statement that it&rsquo;s really difficult</p>
<p>to create something like a human species.</p>
<p>Well, I think what we know is that going from no life</p>
<p>to having life that can do a level of tech,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some sort of two going beyond that</p>
<p>than actually settling our whole universe with life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some major roadblock there,</p>
<p>which is some great filter as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>which is tough to get through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either that roadblock is either behind us</p>
<p>or in front of us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping very much that it&rsquo;s behind us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited every time we get a new report from NASA</p>
<p>saying they failed to find any life on Mars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yes, awesome.</p>
<p>Because that suggests that the hard part,</p>
<p>maybe it was getting the first ribosome</p>
<p>or some very low level kind of stepping stone</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;re home free.</p>
<p>Because if that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>then the future is really only limited</p>
<p>by our own imagination.</p>
<p>It would be much suckier if it turns out</p>
<p>that this level of life is kind of a dime a dozen,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s some other problem.</p>
<p>Like as soon as a civilization gets advanced technology,</p>
<p>within a hundred years,</p>
<p>they get into some stupid fight with themselves and poof.</p>
<p>That would be a bummer.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;ve explored the mysteries of the universe,</p>
<p>the cosmological universe, the one that&rsquo;s sitting</p>
<p>between us today.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve also begun to explore the other universe,</p>
<p>which is sort of the mystery,</p>
<p>the mysterious universe of the mind of intelligence,</p>
<p>of intelligent life.</p>
<p>So is there a common thread between your interest</p>
<p>or the way you think about space and intelligence?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, when I was a teenager,</p>
<p>I was already very fascinated by the biggest questions.</p>
<p>And I felt that the two biggest mysteries of all in science</p>
<p>were our universe out there and our universe in here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite natural after having spent</p>
<p>a quarter of a century on my career,</p>
<p>thinking a lot about this one,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m now indulging in the luxury</p>
<p>of doing research on this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so cool.</p>
<p>I feel the time is ripe now</p>
<p>for you trans greatly deepening our understanding of this.</p>
<p>Just start exploring this one.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I think a lot of people view intelligence</p>
<p>as something mysterious that can only exist</p>
<p>in biological organisms like us,</p>
<p>and therefore dismiss all talk</p>
<p>about artificial general intelligence as science fiction.</p>
<p>But from my perspective as a physicist,</p>
<p>I am a blob of quarks and electrons</p>
<p>moving around in a certain pattern</p>
<p>and processing information in certain ways.</p>
<p>And this is also a blob of quarks and electrons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not smarter than the water bottle</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m made of different kinds of quarks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m made of up quarks and down quarks,</p>
<p>exact same kind as this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no secret sauce, I think, in me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the pattern of the information processing.</p>
<p>And this means that there&rsquo;s no law of physics</p>
<p>saying that we can&rsquo;t create technology,</p>
<p>which can help us by being incredibly intelligent</p>
<p>and help us crack mysteries that we couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In other words, I think we&rsquo;ve really only seen</p>
<p>the tip of the intelligence iceberg so far.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the perceptronium.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you coined this amazing term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hypothetical state of matter,</p>
<p>sort of thinking from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>what is the kind of matter that can help,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re saying, subjective experience emerge,</p>
<p>consciousness emerge.</p>
<p>So how do you think about consciousness</p>
<p>from this physics perspective?</p>
<p>Very good question.</p>
<p>So again, I think many people have underestimated</p>
<p>our ability to make progress on this</p>
<p>by convincing themselves it&rsquo;s hopeless</p>
<p>because somehow we&rsquo;re missing some ingredient that we need.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some new consciousness particle or whatever.</p>
<p>I happen to think that we&rsquo;re not missing anything</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s not the interesting thing</p>
<p>about consciousness that gives us</p>
<p>this amazing subjective experience of colors</p>
<p>and sounds and emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather something at the higher level</p>
<p>about the patterns of information processing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I like to think about this idea</p>
<p>of perceptronium.</p>
<p>What does it mean for an arbitrary physical system</p>
<p>to be conscious in terms of what its particles are doing</p>
<p>or its information is doing?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I hate carbon chauvinism,</p>
<p>this attitude you have to be made of carbon atoms</p>
<p>to be smart or conscious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the information processing</p>
<p>that this kind of matter performs.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can see I have my favorite equations here</p>
<p>describing various fundamental aspects of the world.</p>
<p>I feel that I think one day,</p>
<p>maybe someone who&rsquo;s watching this will come up</p>
<p>with the equations that information processing</p>
<p>has to satisfy to be conscious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite convinced there is big discovery</p>
<p>to be made there because let&rsquo;s face it,</p>
<p>we know that so many things are made up of information.</p>
<p>We know that some information processing is conscious</p>
<p>because we are conscious.</p>
<p>But we also know that a lot of information processing</p>
<p>is not conscious.</p>
<p>Like most of the information processing happening</p>
<p>in your brain right now is not conscious.</p>
<p>There are like 10 megabytes per second coming in</p>
<p>even just through your visual system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not conscious about your heartbeat regulation</p>
<p>or most things.</p>
<p>Even if I just ask you to like read what it says here,</p>
<p>you look at it and then, oh, now you know what it said.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not aware of how the computation actually happened.</p>
<p>Your consciousness is like the CEO</p>
<p>that got an email at the end with the final answer.</p>
<p>So what is it that makes a difference?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s both a great science mystery.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually studying it a little bit in my lab here</p>
<p>at MIT, but I also think it&rsquo;s just a really urgent question</p>
<p>to answer.</p>
<p>For starters, I mean, if you&rsquo;re an emergency room doctor</p>
<p>and you have an unresponsive patient coming in,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if in addition to having</p>
<p>a CT scanner, you had a consciousness scanner</p>
<p>that could figure out whether this person</p>
<p>is actually having locked in syndrome</p>
<p>or is actually comatose.</p>
<p>And in the future, imagine if we build robots</p>
<p>or the machine that we can have really good conversations</p>
<p>with, which I think is very likely to happen.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to know if your home helper robot</p>
<p>is actually experiencing anything or just like a zombie,</p>
<p>I mean, would you prefer it?</p>
<p>What would you prefer?</p>
<p>Would you prefer that it&rsquo;s actually unconscious</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t have to feel guilty about switching it off</p>
<p>or giving boring chores or what would you prefer?</p>
<p>Well, certainly we would prefer,</p>
<p>I would prefer the appearance of consciousness.</p>
<p>But the question is whether the appearance of consciousness</p>
<p>is different than consciousness itself.</p>
<p>And sort of to ask that as a question,</p>
<p>do you think we need to understand what consciousness is,</p>
<p>solve the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>in order to build something like an AGI system?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>And I think we will probably be able to build things</p>
<p>even if we don&rsquo;t answer that question.</p>
<p>But if we want to make sure that what happens</p>
<p>is a good thing, we better solve it first.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a wonderful controversy you&rsquo;re raising there</p>
<p>where you have basically three points of view</p>
<p>about the hard problem.</p>
<p>So there are two different points of view.</p>
<p>They both conclude that the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>is BS.</p>
<p>On one hand, you have some people like Daniel Dennett</p>
<p>who say that consciousness is just BS</p>
<p>because consciousness is the same thing as intelligence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no difference.</p>
<p>So anything which acts conscious is conscious,</p>
<p>just like we are.</p>
<p>And then there are also a lot of people,</p>
<p>including many top AI researchers I know,</p>
<p>who say, oh, consciousness is just bullshit</p>
<p>because, of course, machines can never be conscious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always going to be zombies.</p>
<p>You never have to feel guilty about how you treat them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a third group of people,</p>
<p>including Giulio Tononi, for example,</p>
<p>and Krzysztof Koch and a number of others.</p>
<p>I would put myself also in this middle camp</p>
<p>who say that actually some information processing</p>
<p>is conscious and some is not.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s find the equation which can be used</p>
<p>to determine which it is.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve just been a little bit lazy,</p>
<p>kind of running away from this problem for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost taboo to even mention the C word</p>
<p>in a lot of circles because,</p>
<p>but we should stop making excuses.</p>
<p>This is a science question and there are ways</p>
<p>we can even test any theory that makes predictions for this.</p>
<p>And coming back to this helper robot,</p>
<p>I mean, so you said you&rsquo;d want your helper robot</p>
<p>to certainly act conscious and treat you,</p>
<p>like have conversations with you and stuff.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t you, would you feel,</p>
<p>would you feel a little bit creeped out</p>
<p>if you realized that it was just a glossed up tape recorder,</p>
<p>you know, that was just zombie and was a faking emotion?</p>
<p>Would you prefer that it actually had an experience</p>
<p>or would you prefer that it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>not experiencing anything so you feel,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to feel guilty about what you do to it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a difficult question because, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re in a relationship and you say,</p>
<p>well, I love you.</p>
<p>And the other person said, I love you back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like asking, well, do they really love you back</p>
<p>or are they just saying they love you back?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you really want them to actually love you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to, it&rsquo;s hard to really know the difference</p>
<p>between everything seeming like there&rsquo;s consciousness</p>
<p>present, there&rsquo;s intelligence present,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s affection, passion, love,</p>
<p>and it actually being there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, do you have?</p>
<p>But like, can I ask you a question about this?</p>
<p>Like to make it a bit more pointed.</p>
<p>So Mass General Hospital is right across the river, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re going in for a medical procedure</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, you know, for anesthesia,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to do is we&rsquo;re going to give you</p>
<p>muscle relaxants so you won&rsquo;t be able to move</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to feel excruciating pain</p>
<p>during the whole surgery,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t be able to do anything about it.</p>
<p>But then we&rsquo;re going to give you this drug</p>
<p>that erases your memory of it.</p>
<p>Would you be cool about that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference that you&rsquo;re conscious about it</p>
<p>or not if there&rsquo;s no behavioral change, right?</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s a really, that&rsquo;s a really clear way to put it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, yeah, it feels like in that sense,</p>
<p>experiencing it is a valuable quality.</p>
<p>So actually being able to have subjective experiences,</p>
<p>at least in that case, is valuable.</p>
<p>And I think we humans have a little bit</p>
<p>of a bad track record also of making</p>
<p>these self serving arguments</p>
<p>that other entities aren&rsquo;t conscious.</p>
<p>You know, people often say,</p>
<p>oh, these animals can&rsquo;t feel pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to boil lobsters because we ask them</p>
<p>if it hurt and they didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>And now there was just a paper out saying,</p>
<p>lobsters do feel pain when you boil them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re banning it in Switzerland.</p>
<p>And we did this with slaves too often and said,</p>
<p>oh, they don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t maybe aren&rsquo;t conscious</p>
<p>or women don&rsquo;t have souls or whatever.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a little bit nervous when I hear people</p>
<p>just take as an axiom that machines</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have experience ever.</p>
<p>I think this is just a really fascinating science question</p>
<p>is what it is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s research it and try to figure out</p>
<p>what it is that makes the difference</p>
<p>between unconscious intelligent behavior</p>
<p>and conscious intelligent behavior.</p>
<p>So in terms of, so if you think of a Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>human or robot being sort of with a broom</p>
<p>being pushed around, it starts pushing</p>
<p>on a consciousness question.</p>
<p>So let me ask, do you think an AGI system</p>
<p>like a few neuroscientists believe</p>
<p>needs to have a physical embodiment?</p>
<p>Needs to have a body or something like a body?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>You mean to have a conscious experience?</p>
<p>To have consciousness.</p>
<p>I do think it helps a lot to have a physical embodiment</p>
<p>to learn the kind of things about the world</p>
<p>that are important to us humans, for sure.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think the physical embodiment</p>
<p>is necessary after you&rsquo;ve learned it</p>
<p>to just have the experience.</p>
<p>Think about when you&rsquo;re dreaming, right?</p>
<p>Your eyes are closed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting any sensory input.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not behaving or moving in any way</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still an experience there, right?</p>
<p>And so clearly the experience that you have</p>
<p>when you see something cool in your dreams</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t coming from your eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the information processing itself in your brain</p>
<p>which is that experience, right?</p>
<p>But if I put it another way, I&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>because it comes from neuroscience</p>
<p>is the reason you want to have a body and a physical</p>
<p>something like a physical, you know, a physical system</p>
<p>is because you want to be able to preserve something.</p>
<p>In order to have a self, you could argue,</p>
<p>would you need to have some kind of embodiment of self</p>
<p>to want to preserve?</p>
<p>Well, now we&rsquo;re getting a little bit anthropomorphic</p>
<p>into anthropomorphizing things.</p>
<p>Maybe talking about self preservation instincts.</p>
<p>I mean, we are evolved organisms, right?</p>
<p>So Darwinian evolution endowed us</p>
<p>and other evolved organism with a self preservation instinct</p>
<p>because those that didn&rsquo;t have those self preservation genes</p>
<p>got cleaned out of the gene pool, right?</p>
<p>But if you build an artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>the mind space that you can design is much, much larger</p>
<p>than just a specific subset of minds that can evolve.</p>
<p>So an AGI mind doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have</p>
<p>to have any self preservation instinct.</p>
<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be</p>
<p>so individualistic as us.</p>
<p>Like, imagine if you could just, first of all,</p>
<p>or we are also very afraid of death.</p>
<p>You know, I suppose you could back yourself up</p>
<p>every five minutes and then your airplane</p>
<p>is about to crash.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, shucks, I&rsquo;m gonna lose the last five minutes</p>
<p>of experiences since my last cloud backup, dang.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not as big a deal.</p>
<p>Or if we could just copy experiences between our minds</p>
<p>easily like we, which we could easily do</p>
<p>if we were silicon based, right?</p>
<p>Then maybe we would feel a little bit more</p>
<p>like a hive mind actually, that maybe it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think we should take for granted at all</p>
<p>that AGI will have to have any of those sort of</p>
<p>competitive as alpha male instincts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you know, this is really interesting</p>
<p>because I think some people go too far and say,</p>
<p>of course we don&rsquo;t have to have any concerns either</p>
<p>that advanced AI will have those instincts</p>
<p>because we can build anything we want.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a very nice set of arguments going back</p>
<p>to Steve Omohundro and Nick Bostrom and others</p>
<p>just pointing out that when we build machines,</p>
<p>we normally build them with some kind of goal, you know,</p>
<p>win this chess game, drive this car safely or whatever.</p>
<p>And as soon as you put in a goal into machine,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s kind of open ended goal</p>
<p>and the machine is very intelligent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll break that down into a bunch of sub goals.</p>
<p>And one of those goals will almost always</p>
<p>be self preservation because if it breaks or dies</p>
<p>in the process, it&rsquo;s not gonna accomplish the goal, right?</p>
<p>Like suppose you just build a little,</p>
<p>you have a little robot and you tell it to go down</p>
<p>the store market here and get you some food,</p>
<p>make you cook an Italian dinner, you know,</p>
<p>and then someone mugs it and tries to break it</p>
<p>on the way.</p>
<p>That robot has an incentive to not get destroyed</p>
<p>and defend itself or run away,</p>
<p>because otherwise it&rsquo;s gonna fail in cooking your dinner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not afraid of death,</p>
<p>but it really wants to complete the dinner cooking goal.</p>
<p>So it will have a self preservation instinct.</p>
<p>Continue being a functional agent somehow.</p>
<p>And similarly, if you give any kind of more ambitious goal</p>
<p>to an AGI, it&rsquo;s very likely they wanna acquire</p>
<p>more resources so it can do that better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exactly from those sort of sub goals</p>
<p>that we might not have intended</p>
<p>that some of the concerns about AGI safety come.</p>
<p>You give it some goal that seems completely harmless.</p>
<p>And then before you realize it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also trying to do these other things</p>
<p>which you didn&rsquo;t want it to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s maybe smarter than us.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And let me pause just because I am in a very kind</p>
<p>of human centric way, see fear of death</p>
<p>as a valuable motivator.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think, you think that&rsquo;s an artifact</p>
<p>of evolution, so that&rsquo;s the kind of mind space</p>
<p>evolution created that we&rsquo;re sort of almost obsessed</p>
<p>about self preservation, some kind of genetic flow.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessary to be afraid of death.</p>
<p>So not just a kind of sub goal of self preservation</p>
<p>just so you can keep doing the thing,</p>
<p>but more fundamentally sort of have the finite thing</p>
<p>like this ends for you at some point.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Do I think it&rsquo;s necessary for what precisely?</p>
<p>For intelligence, but also for consciousness.</p>
<p>So for those, for both, do you think really</p>
<p>like a finite death and the fear of it is important?</p>
<p>So before I can answer, before we can agree</p>
<p>on whether it&rsquo;s necessary for intelligence</p>
<p>or for consciousness, we should be clear</p>
<p>on how we define those two words.</p>
<p>Cause a lot of really smart people define them</p>
<p>in very different ways.</p>
<p>I was on this panel with AI experts</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t agree on how to define intelligence even.</p>
<p>So I define intelligence simply</p>
<p>as the ability to accomplish complex goals.</p>
<p>I like your broad definition, because again</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be a carbon chauvinist.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And in that case, no, certainly</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t require fear of death.</p>
<p>I would say alpha go, alpha zero is quite intelligent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think alpha zero has any fear of being turned off</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t understand the concept of it even.</p>
<p>And similarly consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, you could certainly imagine very simple</p>
<p>kind of experience.</p>
<p>If certain plants have any kind of experience</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re very afraid of dying</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s nothing they can do about it anyway much.</p>
<p>So there wasn&rsquo;t that much value in, but more seriously</p>
<p>I think if you ask, not just about being conscious</p>
<p>but maybe having what you would, we might call</p>
<p>an exciting life where you feel passion</p>
<p>and really appreciate the things.</p>
<p>Maybe there somehow, maybe there perhaps it does help</p>
<p>having a backdrop that, Hey, it&rsquo;s finite.</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s make the most of this, let&rsquo;s live to the fullest.</p>
<p>So if you knew you were going to live forever</p>
<p>do you think you would change your?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, in some perspective</p>
<p>it would be an incredibly boring life living forever.</p>
<p>So in the sort of loose subjective terms that you said</p>
<p>of something exciting and something in this</p>
<p>that other humans would understand, I think is, yeah</p>
<p>it seems that the finiteness of it is important.</p>
<p>Well, the good news I have for you then is</p>
<p>based on what we understand about cosmology</p>
<p>everything is in our universe is probably</p>
<p>ultimately probably finite, although.</p>
<p>Big crunch or big, what&rsquo;s the, the infinite expansion.</p>
<p>Yeah, we could have a big chill or a big crunch</p>
<p>or a big rip or that&rsquo;s the big snap or death bubbles.</p>
<p>All of them are more than a billion years away.</p>
<p>So we should, we certainly have vastly more time</p>
<p>than our ancestors thought, but there is still</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still pretty hard to squeeze in an infinite number</p>
<p>of compute cycles, even though there are some loopholes</p>
<p>that just might be possible.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, some people like to say</p>
<p>that you should live as if you&rsquo;re about to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to die in five years or so.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of optimal.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a good assumption.</p>
<p>We should build our civilization as if it&rsquo;s all finite</p>
<p>to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So you mentioned defining intelligence</p>
<p>as the ability to solve complex goals.</p>
<p>Where would you draw a line or how would you try</p>
<p>to define human level intelligence</p>
<p>and superhuman level intelligence?</p>
<p>Where is consciousness part of that definition?</p>
<p>No, consciousness does not come into this definition.</p>
<p>So, so I think of intelligence as it&rsquo;s a spectrum</p>
<p>but there are very many different kinds of goals</p>
<p>you can have.</p>
<p>You can have a goal to be a good chess player</p>
<p>a good goal player, a good car driver, a good investor</p>
<p>good poet, et cetera.</p>
<p>So intelligence that by its very nature</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t something you can measure by this one number</p>
<p>or some overall goodness.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>There are some people who are more better at this.</p>
<p>Some people are better than that.</p>
<p>Right now we have machines that are much better than us</p>
<p>at some very narrow tasks like multiplying large numbers</p>
<p>fast, memorizing large databases, playing chess</p>
<p>playing go and soon driving cars.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still no machine that can match</p>
<p>a human child in general intelligence</p>
<p>but artificial general intelligence, AGI</p>
<p>the name of your course, of course</p>
<p>that is by its very definition, the quest</p>
<p>to build a machine that can do everything</p>
<p>as well as we can.</p>
<p>So the old Holy grail of AI from back to its inception</p>
<p>in the sixties, if that ever happens, of course</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be the biggest transition</p>
<p>in the history of life on earth</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to wait the big impact</p>
<p>until machines are better than us at knitting</p>
<p>that the really big change doesn&rsquo;t come exactly</p>
<p>at the moment they&rsquo;re better than us at everything.</p>
<p>The really big change comes first</p>
<p>there are big changes when they start becoming better</p>
<p>at us at doing most of the jobs that we do</p>
<p>because that takes away much of the demand</p>
<p>for human labor.</p>
<p>And then the really whopping change comes</p>
<p>when they become better than us at AI research, right?</p>
<p>Because right now the timescale of AI research</p>
<p>is limited by the human research and development cycle</p>
<p>of years typically, you know</p>
<p>how long does it take from one release of some software</p>
<p>or iPhone or whatever to the next?</p>
<p>But once Google can replace 40,000 engineers</p>
<p>by 40,000 equivalent pieces of software or whatever</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s no reason that has to be years</p>
<p>it can be in principle much faster</p>
<p>and the timescale of future progress in AI</p>
<p>and all of science and technology will be driven</p>
<p>by machines, not humans.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this simple point which gives right</p>
<p>this incredibly fun controversy</p>
<p>about whether there can be intelligence explosion</p>
<p>so called singularity as Werner Vinge called it.</p>
<p>Now the idea is articulated by I.J. Good</p>
<p>is obviously way back fifties</p>
<p>but you can see Alan Turing</p>
<p>and others thought about it even earlier.</p>
<p>So you asked me what exactly would I define</p>
<p>human level intelligence, yeah.</p>
<p>So the glib answer is to say something</p>
<p>which is better than us at all cognitive tasks</p>
<p>with a better than any human at all cognitive tasks</p>
<p>but the really interesting bar</p>
<p>I think goes a little bit lower than that actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when they can, when they&rsquo;re better than us</p>
<p>at AI programming and general learning</p>
<p>so that they can if they want to get better</p>
<p>than us at anything by just studying.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re better is a key word and better is towards</p>
<p>this kind of spectrum of the complexity of goals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to accomplish.</p>
<p>So another way to, and that&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>a very clear definition of human love.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost like a sea that&rsquo;s rising</p>
<p>you can do more and more and more things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a geographic that you show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really nice way to put it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some peaks that</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an ocean level elevating</p>
<p>and you solve more and more problems</p>
<p>but just kind of to take a pause</p>
<p>and we took a bunch of questions</p>
<p>and a lot of social networks</p>
<p>and a bunch of people asked</p>
<p>a sort of a slightly different direction</p>
<p>on creativity and things that perhaps aren&rsquo;t a peak.</p>
<p>Human beings are flawed</p>
<p>and perhaps better means having contradiction</p>
<p>being flawed in some way.</p>
<p>So let me sort of start easy, first of all.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of cool equations.</p>
<p>Let me ask, what&rsquo;s your favorite equation, first of all?</p>
<p>I know they&rsquo;re all like your children, but like</p>
<p>which one is that?</p>
<p>This is the shirt in your equation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the master key of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>of the micro world.</p>
<p>So this equation will protect everything</p>
<p>to do with atoms, molecules and all the way up.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, okay.</p>
<p>So quantum mechanics is certainly a beautiful</p>
<p>mysterious formulation of our world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to sort of ask you, just as an example</p>
<p>it perhaps doesn&rsquo;t have the same beauty as physics does</p>
<p>but in mathematics abstract, the Andrew Wiles</p>
<p>who proved the Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem.</p>
<p>So he just saw this recently</p>
<p>and it kind of caught my eye a little bit.</p>
<p>This is 358 years after it was conjectured.</p>
<p>So this is very simple formulation.</p>
<p>Everybody tried to prove it, everybody failed.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s this guy comes along</p>
<p>and eventually proves it and then fails to prove it</p>
<p>and then proves it again in 94.</p>
<p>And he said like the moment when everything connected</p>
<p>into place in an interview said</p>
<p>it was so indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p>That moment when you finally realize the connecting piece</p>
<p>of two conjectures.</p>
<p>He said, it was so indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p>It was so simple and so elegant.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t understand how I&rsquo;d missed it.</p>
<p>And I just stared at it in disbelief for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Then during the day, I walked around the department</p>
<p>and I keep coming back to my desk</p>
<p>looking to see if it was still there.</p>
<p>It was still there.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t contain myself.</p>
<p>I was so excited.</p>
<p>It was the most important moment on my working life.</p>
<p>Nothing I ever do again will mean as much.</p>
<p>So that particular moment.</p>
<p>And it kind of made me think of what would it take?</p>
<p>And I think we have all been there at small levels.</p>
<p>Maybe let me ask, have you had a moment like that</p>
<p>in your life where you just had an idea?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, yes.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mention myself in the same breath</p>
<p>as Andrew Wiles, but I&rsquo;ve certainly had a number</p>
<p>of aha moments when I realized something very cool</p>
<p>about physics, which has completely made my head explode.</p>
<p>In fact, some of my favorite discoveries I made later,</p>
<p>I later realized that they had been discovered earlier</p>
<p>by someone who sometimes got quite famous for it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s too late for me to even publish it,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t diminish in any way.</p>
<p>The emotional experience you have when you realize it,</p>
<p>like, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what would it take in that moment, that wow,</p>
<p>that was yours in that moment?</p>
<p>So what do you think it takes for an intelligence system,</p>
<p>an AGI system, an AI system to have a moment like that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky question</p>
<p>because there are actually two parts to it, right?</p>
<p>One of them is, can it accomplish that proof?</p>
<p>Can it prove that you can never write A to the N</p>
<p>plus B to the N equals three to that equal Z to the N</p>
<p>for all integers, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>when N is bigger than two?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply a question about intelligence.</p>
<p>Can you build machines that are that intelligent?</p>
<p>And I think by the time we get a machine</p>
<p>that can independently come up with that level of proofs,</p>
<p>probably quite close to AGI.</p>
<p>The second question is a question about consciousness.</p>
<p>When will we, how likely is it that such a machine</p>
<p>will actually have any experience at all,</p>
<p>as opposed to just being like a zombie?</p>
<p>And would we expect it to have some sort of emotional response</p>
<p>to this or anything at all akin to human emotion</p>
<p>where when it accomplishes its machine goal,</p>
<p>it views it as somehow something very positive</p>
<p>and sublime and deeply meaningful?</p>
<p>I would certainly hope that if in the future</p>
<p>we do create machines that are our peers</p>
<p>or even our descendants, that I would certainly</p>
<p>hope that they do have this sublime appreciation of life.</p>
<p>In a way, my absolutely worst nightmare</p>
<p>would be that at some point in the future,</p>
<p>the distant future, maybe our cosmos</p>
<p>is teeming with all this post biological life doing</p>
<p>all the seemingly cool stuff.</p>
<p>And maybe the last humans, by the time</p>
<p>our species eventually fizzles out,</p>
<p>will be like, well, that&rsquo;s OK because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so proud of our descendants here.</p>
<p>And look what all the, my worst nightmare</p>
<p>is that we haven&rsquo;t solved the consciousness problem.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t realized that these are all the zombies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not aware of anything any more than a tape recorder</p>
<p>has any kind of experience.</p>
<p>So the whole thing has just become</p>
<p>a play for empty benches.</p>
<p>That would be the ultimate zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>So I would much rather, in that case,</p>
<p>that we have these beings which can really</p>
<p>appreciate how amazing it is.</p>
<p>And in that picture, what would be the role of creativity?</p>
<p>A few people ask about creativity.</p>
<p>When you think about intelligence,</p>
<p>certainly the story you told at the beginning of your book</p>
<p>involved creating movies and so on, making money.</p>
<p>You can make a lot of money in our modern world</p>
<p>with music and movies.</p>
<p>So if you are an intelligent system,</p>
<p>you may want to get good at that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not necessarily what I mean by creativity.</p>
<p>Is it important on that complex goals</p>
<p>where the sea is rising for there</p>
<p>to be something creative?</p>
<p>Or am I being very human centric and thinking creativity</p>
<p>somehow special relative to intelligence?</p>
<p>My hunch is that we should think of creativity simply</p>
<p>as an aspect of intelligence.</p>
<p>And we have to be very careful with human vanity.</p>
<p>We have this tendency to very often want</p>
<p>to say, as soon as machines can do something,</p>
<p>we try to diminish it and say, oh, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not real intelligence.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it creative or this or that?</p>
<p>The other thing, if we ask ourselves</p>
<p>to write down a definition of what we actually mean</p>
<p>by being creative, what we mean by Andrew Wiles, what he did</p>
<p>there, for example, don&rsquo;t we often mean that someone takes</p>
<p>a very unexpected leap?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like taking 573 and multiplying it</p>
<p>by 224 by just a step of straightforward cookbook</p>
<p>like rules, right?</p>
<p>You can maybe make a connection between two things</p>
<p>that people had never thought was connected or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>I think this is an aspect of intelligence.</p>
<p>And this is actually one of the most important aspects of it.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason we humans tend to be better at it</p>
<p>than traditional computers is because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that comes more naturally if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a neural network than if you&rsquo;re a traditional logic gate</p>
<p>based computer machine.</p>
<p>We physically have all these connections.</p>
<p>And you activate here, activate here, activate here.</p>
<p>Bing.</p>
<p>My hunch is that if we ever build a machine where you could</p>
<p>just give it the task, hey, you say, hey, I just realized</p>
<p>I want to travel around the world instead this month.</p>
<p>Can you teach my AGI course for me?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, OK, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And it does everything that you would have done</p>
<p>and improvises and stuff.</p>
<p>That would, in my mind, involve a lot of creativity.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s actually a beautiful way to put it.</p>
<p>I think we do try to grasp at the definition of intelligence</p>
<p>is everything we don&rsquo;t understand how to build.</p>
<p>So we as humans try to find things</p>
<p>that we have and machines don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And maybe creativity is just one of the things, one</p>
<p>of the words we use to describe that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting way to put it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need to be that defensive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anything good comes out of saying,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re somehow special, you know?</p>
<p>Contrary wise, there are many examples in history</p>
<p>of where trying to pretend that we&rsquo;re somehow superior</p>
<p>to all other intelligent beings has led to pretty bad results,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Nazi Germany, they said that they were somehow superior</p>
<p>to other people.</p>
<p>Today, we still do a lot of cruelty to animals</p>
<p>by saying that we&rsquo;re so superior somehow,</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t feel pain.</p>
<p>Slavery was justified by the same kind</p>
<p>of just really weak arguments.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think if we actually go ahead and build</p>
<p>artificial general intelligence, it</p>
<p>can do things better than us, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we should try to found our self worth on some sort</p>
<p>of bogus claims of superiority in terms</p>
<p>of our intelligence.</p>
<p>I think we should instead find our calling</p>
<p>and the meaning of life from the experiences that we have.</p>
<p>I can have very meaningful experiences</p>
<p>even if there are other people who are smarter than me.</p>
<p>When I go to a faculty meeting here,</p>
<p>and we talk about something, and then I certainly realize,</p>
<p>oh, boy, he has an old prize, he has an old prize,</p>
<p>he has an old prize, I don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
<p>Does that make me enjoy life any less</p>
<p>or enjoy talking to those people less?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>And the contrary, I feel very honored and privileged</p>
<p>to get to interact with other very intelligent beings that</p>
<p>are better than me at a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reason why</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have the same approach with intelligent machines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting.</p>
<p>So people don&rsquo;t often think about that.</p>
<p>They think about when there&rsquo;s going,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s machines that are more intelligent,</p>
<p>you naturally think that that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be a beneficial type of intelligence.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize it could be like peers with Nobel prizes</p>
<p>that would be just fun to talk with,</p>
<p>and they might be clever about certain topics,</p>
<p>and you can have fun having a few drinks with them.</p>
<p>Well, also, another example we can all</p>
<p>relate to of why it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a terrible thing</p>
<p>to be in the presence of people who are even smarter than us</p>
<p>all around is when you and I were both two years old,</p>
<p>I mean, our parents were much more intelligent than us,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Worked out OK, because their goals</p>
<p>were aligned with our goals.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is really the number one key issue</p>
<p>we have to solve if we value align the value alignment</p>
<p>problem, exactly.</p>
<p>Because people who see too many Hollywood movies</p>
<p>with lousy science fiction plot lines,</p>
<p>they worry about the wrong thing, right?</p>
<p>They worry about some machine suddenly turning evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not malice that is the concern.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s competence.</p>
<p>By definition, intelligent makes you very competent.</p>
<p>If you have a more intelligent goal playing,</p>
<p>computer playing is a less intelligent one.</p>
<p>And when we define intelligence as the ability</p>
<p>to accomplish goal winning, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be the more intelligent one that wins.</p>
<p>And if you have a human and then you</p>
<p>have an AGI that&rsquo;s more intelligent in all ways</p>
<p>and they have different goals, guess who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to get their way, right?</p>
<p>So I was just reading about this particular rhinoceros species</p>
<p>that was driven extinct just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Ellen Bummer is looking at this cute picture of a mommy</p>
<p>rhinoceros with its child.</p>
<p>And why did we humans drive it to extinction?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t because we were evil rhino haters as a whole.</p>
<p>It was just because our goals weren&rsquo;t aligned</p>
<p>with those of the rhinoceros.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t work out so well for the rhinoceros</p>
<p>because we were more intelligent, right?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just so important</p>
<p>that if we ever do build AGI, before we unleash anything,</p>
<p>we have to make sure that it learns</p>
<p>to understand our goals, that it adopts our goals,</p>
<p>and that it retains those goals.</p>
<p>So the cool, interesting problem there</p>
<p>is us as human beings trying to formulate our values.</p>
<p>So you could think of the United States Constitution as a way</p>
<p>that people sat down, at the time a bunch of white men,</p>
<p>which is a good example, I should say.</p>
<p>They formulated the goals for this country.</p>
<p>And a lot of people agree that those goals actually</p>
<p>held up pretty well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting formulation of values</p>
<p>and failed miserably in other ways.</p>
<p>So for the value alignment problem and the solution to it,</p>
<p>we have to be able to put on paper or in a program</p>
<p>human values.</p>
<p>How difficult do you think that is?</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>We really have to give it our best.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult for two separate reasons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the technical value alignment problem</p>
<p>of figuring out just how to make machines understand our goals,</p>
<p>adopt them, and retain them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the separate part of it,</p>
<p>the philosophical part.</p>
<p>Whose values anyway?</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s not like we have any great consensus</p>
<p>on this planet on values, what mechanism should we</p>
<p>create then to aggregate and decide, OK,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good compromise?</p>
<p>That second discussion can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>be left to tech nerds like myself.</p>
<p>And if we refuse to talk about it and then AGI gets built,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to be actually making</p>
<p>the decision about whose values?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of dudes in some tech company.</p>
<p>And are they necessarily so representative of all</p>
<p>of humankind that we want to just entrust it to them?</p>
<p>Are they even uniquely qualified to speak</p>
<p>to future human happiness just because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good at programming AI?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather have this be a really inclusive conversation.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>So you create a beautiful vision that includes the diversity,</p>
<p>cultural diversity, and various perspectives on discussing</p>
<p>rights, freedoms, human dignity.</p>
<p>But how hard is it to come to that consensus?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s certainly a really important thing</p>
<p>that we should all try to do?</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s feasible?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better way to guarantee failure than to</p>
<p>refuse to talk about it or refuse to try.</p>
<p>And I also think it&rsquo;s a really bad strategy</p>
<p>to say, OK, let&rsquo;s first have a discussion for a long time.</p>
<p>And then once we reach complete consensus,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll try to load it into some machine.</p>
<p>No, we shouldn&rsquo;t let perfect be the enemy of good.</p>
<p>Instead, we should start with the kindergarten ethics</p>
<p>that pretty much everybody agrees on</p>
<p>and put that into machines now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing that even.</p>
<p>Look at anyone who builds this passenger aircraft,</p>
<p>wants it to never under any circumstances</p>
<p>fly into a building or a mountain.</p>
<p>Yet the September 11 hijackers were able to do that.</p>
<p>And even more embarrassingly, Andreas Lubitz,</p>
<p>this depressed Germanwings pilot,</p>
<p>when he flew his passenger jet into the Alps killing over 100</p>
<p>people, he just told the autopilot to do it.</p>
<p>He told the freaking computer to change the altitude</p>
<p>to 100 meters.</p>
<p>And even though it had the GPS maps, everything,</p>
<p>the computer was like, OK.</p>
<p>So we should take those very basic values,</p>
<p>where the problem is not that we don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>The problem is just we&rsquo;ve been too lazy</p>
<p>to try to put it into our machines</p>
<p>and make sure that from now on, airplanes will just,</p>
<p>which all have computers in them,</p>
<p>but will just refuse to do something like that.</p>
<p>Go into safe mode, maybe lock the cockpit door,</p>
<p>go over to the nearest airport.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much other technology in our world</p>
<p>as well now, where it&rsquo;s really becoming quite timely</p>
<p>to put in some sort of very basic values like this.</p>
<p>Even in cars, we&rsquo;ve had enough vehicle terrorism attacks</p>
<p>by now, where people have driven trucks and vans</p>
<p>into pedestrians, that it&rsquo;s not at all a crazy idea</p>
<p>to just have that hardwired into the car.</p>
<p>Because yeah, there are a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always going to be people who for some reason</p>
<p>want to harm others, but most of those people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the technical expertise to figure out</p>
<p>how to work around something like that.</p>
<p>So if the car just won&rsquo;t do it, it helps.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of, that&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>So not chasing perfect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that most of the world agrees on.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>And then once we start there,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll also get into the habit of having</p>
<p>these kind of conversations about, okay,</p>
<p>what else should we put in here and have these discussions?</p>
<p>This should be a gradual process then.</p>
<p>Great, so, but that also means describing these things</p>
<p>and describing it to a machine.</p>
<p>So one thing, we had a few conversations</p>
<p>with Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with Stephen.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I know him quite well.</p>
<p>So he is, he works with a bunch of things,</p>
<p>but cellular automata, these simple computable things,</p>
<p>these computation systems.</p>
<p>And he kind of mentioned that,</p>
<p>we probably have already within these systems</p>
<p>already something that&rsquo;s AGI,</p>
<p>meaning like we just don&rsquo;t know it</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t talk to it.</p>
<p>So if you give me this chance to try to at least</p>
<p>form a question out of this is,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an interesting idea to think</p>
<p>that we can have intelligent systems,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know how to describe something to them</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t communicate with us.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re doing a little bit of work in explainable AI,</p>
<p>trying to get AI to explain itself.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts of natural language processing</p>
<p>or some kind of other communication?</p>
<p>How does the AI explain something to us?</p>
<p>How do we explain something to it, to machines?</p>
<p>Or you think of it differently?</p>
<p>So there are two separate parts to your question there.</p>
<p>One of them has to do with communication,</p>
<p>which is super interesting, I&rsquo;ll get to that in a sec.</p>
<p>The other is whether we already have AGI</p>
<p>but we just haven&rsquo;t noticed it there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There I beg to differ.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything in any cellular automaton</p>
<p>or anything or the internet itself or whatever</p>
<p>that has artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>and that it can really do exactly everything</p>
<p>we humans can do better.</p>
<p>I think the day that happens, when that happens,</p>
<p>we will very soon notice, we&rsquo;ll probably notice even before</p>
<p>because in a very, very big way.</p>
<p>But for the second part, though.</p>
<p>Wait, can I ask, sorry.</p>
<p>So, because you have this beautiful way</p>
<p>to formulating consciousness as information processing,</p>
<p>and you can think of intelligence</p>
<p>as information processing,</p>
<p>and you can think of the entire universe</p>
<p>as these particles and these systems roaming around</p>
<p>that have this information processing power.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there is something with the power</p>
<p>to process information in the way that we human beings do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there that needs to be sort of connected to.</p>
<p>It seems a little bit philosophical, perhaps,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something compelling to the idea</p>
<p>that the power is already there,</p>
<p>which the focus should be more on being able</p>
<p>to communicate with it.</p>
<p>Well, I agree that in a certain sense,</p>
<p>the hardware processing power is already out there</p>
<p>because our universe itself can think of it</p>
<p>as being a computer already, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly computing what water waves,</p>
<p>how it devolved the water waves in the River Charles</p>
<p>and how to move the air molecules around.</p>
<p>Seth Lloyd has pointed out, my colleague here,</p>
<p>that you can even in a very rigorous way</p>
<p>think of our entire universe as being a quantum computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that our universe</p>
<p>supports this amazing processing power</p>
<p>because you can even,</p>
<p>within this physics computer that we live in, right?</p>
<p>We can even build actual laptops and stuff,</p>
<p>so clearly the power is there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that most of the compute power that nature has,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, in my opinion, kind of wasting on boring stuff</p>
<p>like simulating yet another ocean wave somewhere</p>
<p>where no one is even looking, right?</p>
<p>So in a sense, what life does, what we are doing</p>
<p>when we build computers is we&rsquo;re rechanneling</p>
<p>all this compute that nature is doing anyway</p>
<p>into doing things that are more interesting</p>
<p>than just yet another ocean wave,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s do something cool here.</p>
<p>So the raw hardware power is there, for sure,</p>
<p>but then even just computing what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>for the next five seconds in this water bottle,</p>
<p>takes a ridiculous amount of compute</p>
<p>if you do it on a human computer.</p>
<p>This water bottle just did it.</p>
<p>But that does not mean that this water bottle has AGI</p>
<p>because AGI means it should also be able to,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve written my book, done this interview.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just communication problems.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think it can do it.</p>
<p>Although Buddhists say when they watch the water</p>
<p>and that there is some beauty,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some depth and beauty in nature</p>
<p>that they can communicate with.</p>
<p>Communication is also very important though</p>
<p>because I mean, look, part of my job is being a teacher.</p>
<p>And I know some very intelligent professors even</p>
<p>who just have a bit of hard time communicating.</p>
<p>They come up with all these brilliant ideas,</p>
<p>but to communicate with somebody else,</p>
<p>you have to also be able to simulate their own mind.</p>
<p>Yes, empathy.</p>
<p>Build well enough and understand model of their mind</p>
<p>that you can say things that they will understand.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s quite difficult.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why today it&rsquo;s so frustrating</p>
<p>if you have a computer that makes some cancer diagnosis</p>
<p>and you ask it, well, why are you saying</p>
<p>I should have this surgery?</p>
<p>And if it can only reply,</p>
<p>I was trained on five terabytes of data</p>
<p>and this is my diagnosis, boop, boop, beep, beep.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really instill a lot of confidence, right?</p>
<p>So I think we have a lot of work to do</p>
<p>on communication there.</p>
<p>So what kind of, I think you&rsquo;re doing a little bit of work</p>
<p>in explainable AI.</p>
<p>What do you think are the most promising avenues?</p>
<p>Is it mostly about sort of the Alexa problem</p>
<p>of natural language processing of being able</p>
<p>to actually use human interpretable methods</p>
<p>of communication?</p>
<p>So being able to talk to a system and it talk back to you,</p>
<p>or is there some more fundamental problems to be solved?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all of the above.</p>
<p>The natural language processing is obviously important,</p>
<p>but there are also more nerdy fundamental problems.</p>
<p>Like if you take, you play chess?</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m Russian.</p>
<p>I have to.</p>
<p>You speak Russian?</p>
<p>Yes, I speak Russian.</p>
<p>Excellent, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>When did you learn Russian?</p>
<p>I speak very bad Russian, I&rsquo;m only an autodidact,</p>
<p>but I bought a book, Teach Yourself Russian,</p>
<p>read a lot, but it was very difficult.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I speak so bad.</p>
<p>How many languages do you know?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s really impressive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, my wife has some calculation,</p>
<p>but my point was, if you play chess,</p>
<p>have you looked at the AlphaZero games?</p>
<p>The actual games, no.</p>
<p>Check it out, some of them are just mind blowing,</p>
<p>really beautiful.</p>
<p>And if you ask, how did it do that?</p>
<p>You go talk to Demis Hassabis,</p>
<p>I know others from DeepMind,</p>
<p>all they&rsquo;ll ultimately be able to give you</p>
<p>is big tables of numbers, matrices,</p>
<p>that define the neural network.</p>
<p>And you can stare at these tables of numbers</p>
<p>till your face turn blue,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna understand much</p>
<p>about why it made that move.</p>
<p>And even if you have natural language processing</p>
<p>that can tell you in human language about,</p>
<p>oh, five, seven, points, two, eight,</p>
<p>still not gonna really help.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a whole spectrum of fun challenges</p>
<p>that are involved in taking a computation</p>
<p>that does intelligent things</p>
<p>and transforming it into something equally good,</p>
<p>equally intelligent, but that&rsquo;s more understandable.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really valuable</p>
<p>because I think as we put machines in charge</p>
<p>of ever more infrastructure in our world,</p>
<p>the power grid, the trading on the stock market,</p>
<p>weapon systems and so on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely crucial that we can trust</p>
<p>these AIs to do all we want.</p>
<p>And trust really comes from understanding</p>
<p>in a very fundamental way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m working on this,</p>
<p>because I think the more,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna have some hope of ensuring</p>
<p>that machines have adopted our goals</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re gonna retain them,</p>
<p>that kind of trust, I think,</p>
<p>needs to be based on things you can actually understand,</p>
<p>preferably even improve theorems on.</p>
<p>Even with a self driving car, right?</p>
<p>If someone just tells you it&rsquo;s been trained</p>
<p>on tons of data and it never crashed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less reassuring than if someone actually has a proof.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a computer verified proof,</p>
<p>but still it says that under no circumstances</p>
<p>is this car just gonna swerve into oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>And that kind of information helps to build trust</p>
<p>and helps build the alignment of goals,</p>
<p>at least awareness that your goals, your values are aligned.</p>
<p>And I think even in the very short term,</p>
<p>if you look at how, you know, today, right?</p>
<p>This absolutely pathetic state of cybersecurity</p>
<p>that we have, where is it?</p>
<p>Three billion Yahoo accounts we can&rsquo;t pack,</p>
<p>almost every American&rsquo;s credit card and so on.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately happening because we have software</p>
<p>that nobody fully understood how it worked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the bugs hadn&rsquo;t been found, right?</p>
<p>And I think AI can be used very effectively</p>
<p>for offense, for hacking,</p>
<p>but it can also be used for defense.</p>
<p>Hopefully automating verifiability</p>
<p>and creating systems that are built in different ways</p>
<p>so you can actually prove things about them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>So speaking of software that nobody understands</p>
<p>how it works, of course, a bunch of people ask</p>
<p>about your paper, about your thoughts</p>
<p>of why does deep and cheap learning work so well?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the paper.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts on deep learning?</p>
<p>These kind of simplified models of our own brains</p>
<p>have been able to do some successful perception work,</p>
<p>pattern recognition work, and now with AlphaZero and so on,</p>
<p>do some clever things.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the promise limitations</p>
<p>of this piece?</p>
<p>Great, I think there are a number of very important insights,</p>
<p>very important lessons we can always draw</p>
<p>from these kinds of successes.</p>
<p>One of them is when you look at the human brain,</p>
<p>you see it&rsquo;s very complicated, 10th of 11 neurons,</p>
<p>and there are all these different kinds of neurons</p>
<p>and yada, yada, and there&rsquo;s been this long debate</p>
<p>about whether the fact that we have dozens</p>
<p>of different kinds is actually necessary for intelligence.</p>
<p>We can now, I think, quite convincingly answer</p>
<p>that question of no, it&rsquo;s enough to have just one kind.</p>
<p>If you look under the hood of AlphaZero,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one kind of neuron</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ridiculously simple mathematical thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like in physics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, if you have a gas with waves in it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the detailed nature of the molecule that matter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the collective behavior somehow.</p>
<p>Similarly, it&rsquo;s this higher level structure</p>
<p>of the network that matters,</p>
<p>not that you have 20 kinds of neurons.</p>
<p>I think our brain is such a complicated mess</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t evolved just to be intelligent,</p>
<p>it was involved to also be self assembling</p>
<p>and self repairing, right?</p>
<p>And evolutionarily attainable.</p>
<p>And so on and so on.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s pretty,</p>
<p>my hunch is that we&rsquo;re going to understand</p>
<p>how to build AGI before we fully understand</p>
<p>how our brains work, just like we understood</p>
<p>how to build flying machines long before</p>
<p>we were able to build a mechanical bird.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given the example exactly of mechanical birds</p>
<p>and airplanes and airplanes do a pretty good job</p>
<p>of flying without really mimicking bird flight.</p>
<p>And even now after 100 years later,</p>
<p>did you see the Ted talk with this German mechanical bird?</p>
<p>I heard you mention it.</p>
<p>Check it out, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But even after that, right,</p>
<p>we still don&rsquo;t fly in mechanical birds</p>
<p>because it turned out the way we came up with was simpler</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s better for our purposes.</p>
<p>And I think it might be the same there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one lesson.</p>
<p>And another lesson, it&rsquo;s more what our paper was about.</p>
<p>First, as a physicist thought it was fascinating</p>
<p>how there&rsquo;s a very close mathematical relationship</p>
<p>actually between our artificial neural networks</p>
<p>and a lot of things that we&rsquo;ve studied for in physics</p>
<p>go by nerdy names like the renormalization group equation</p>
<p>and Hamiltonians and yada, yada, yada.</p>
<p>And when you look a little more closely at this,</p>
<p>you have,</p>
<p>at first I was like, well, there&rsquo;s something crazy here</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Because we know that if you even want to build</p>
<p>a super simple neural network to tell apart cat pictures</p>
<p>and dog pictures, right,</p>
<p>that you can do that very, very well now.</p>
<p>But if you think about it a little bit,</p>
<p>you convince yourself it must be impossible</p>
<p>because if I have one megapixel,</p>
<p>even if each pixel is just black or white,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two to the power of 1 million possible images,</p>
<p>which is way more than there are atoms in our universe,</p>
<p>right, so in order to,</p>
<p>and then for each one of those,</p>
<p>I have to assign a number,</p>
<p>which is the probability that it&rsquo;s a dog.</p>
<p>So an arbitrary function of images</p>
<p>is a list of more numbers than there are atoms in our universe.</p>
<p>So clearly I can&rsquo;t store that under the hood of my GPU</p>
<p>or my computer, yet somehow it works.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it means that out of all of the problems</p>
<p>that you could try to solve with a neural network,</p>
<p>almost all of them are impossible to solve</p>
<p>with a reasonably sized one.</p>
<p>But then what we showed in our paper</p>
<p>was that the fraction, the kind of problems,</p>
<p>the fraction of all the problems</p>
<p>that you could possibly pose,</p>
<p>that we actually care about given the laws of physics</p>
<p>is also an infinite testimony, tiny little part.</p>
<p>And amazingly, they&rsquo;re basically the same part.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s almost like our world was created for,</p>
<p>I mean, they kind of come together.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you could say maybe where the world was created</p>
<p>for us, but I have a more modest interpretation,</p>
<p>which is that the world was created for us,</p>
<p>but I have a more modest interpretation,</p>
<p>which is that instead evolution endowed us</p>
<p>with neural networks precisely for that reason.</p>
<p>Because this particular architecture,</p>
<p>as opposed to the one in your laptop,</p>
<p>is very, very well adapted to solving the kind of problems</p>
<p>that nature kept presenting our ancestors with.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that why do we have a brain</p>
<p>in the first place?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to be able to make predictions about the future</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So if we had a sucky system, which could never solve it,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have a world.</p>
<p>So this is, I think, a very beautiful fact.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We also realize that there&rsquo;s been earlier work</p>
<p>on why deeper networks are good,</p>
<p>but we were able to show an additional cool fact there,</p>
<p>which is that even incredibly simple problems,</p>
<p>like suppose I give you a thousand numbers</p>
<p>and ask you to multiply them together,</p>
<p>and you can write a few lines of code, boom, done, trivial.</p>
<p>If you just try to do that with a neural network</p>
<p>that has only one single hidden layer in it,</p>
<p>you can do it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to need two to the power of a thousand</p>
<p>neurons to multiply a thousand numbers,</p>
<p>which is, again, more neurons than there are atoms</p>
<p>in our universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But if you allow yourself to make it a deep network</p>
<p>with many layers, you only need 4,000 neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly feasible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So on another architecture type,</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation,</p>
<p>and what are your thoughts about quantum computing</p>
<p>and the role of this kind of computational unit</p>
<p>in creating an intelligence system?</p>
<p>In some Hollywood movies that I will not mention by name</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to spoil them.</p>
<p>The way they get AGI is building a quantum computer.</p>
<p>Because the word quantum sounds cool and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>First of all, I think we don&rsquo;t need quantum computers</p>
<p>to build AGI.</p>
<p>I suspect your brain is not a quantum computer</p>
<p>in any profound sense.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t even wrote a paper about that</p>
<p>a lot many years ago.</p>
<p>I calculated the so called decoherence time,</p>
<p>how long it takes until the quantum computerness</p>
<p>of what your neurons are doing gets erased</p>
<p>by just random noise from the environment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about 10 to the minus 21 seconds.</p>
<p>So as cool as it would be to have a quantum computer</p>
<p>in my head, I don&rsquo;t think that fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>there are very cool things you could do</p>
<p>with quantum computers.</p>
<p>Or I think we&rsquo;ll be able to do soon</p>
<p>when we get bigger ones.</p>
<p>That might actually help machine learning</p>
<p>do even better than the brain.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>one, this is just a moonshot,</p>
<p>but learning is very much same thing as search.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to train a neural network</p>
<p>to get really learned to do something really well,</p>
<p>you have some loss function,</p>
<p>you have a bunch of knobs you can turn,</p>
<p>represented by a bunch of numbers,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to tweak them</p>
<p>so that it becomes as good as possible at this thing.</p>
<p>So if you think of a landscape with some valley,</p>
<p>where each dimension of the landscape</p>
<p>corresponds to some number you can change,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to find the minimum.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s well known that</p>
<p>if you have a very high dimensional landscape,</p>
<p>complicated things, it&rsquo;s super hard to find the minimum.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is amazingly good at this.</p>
<p>Like if I want to know what&rsquo;s the lowest energy state</p>
<p>this water can possibly have,</p>
<p>incredibly hard to compute,</p>
<p>but nature will happily figure this out for you</p>
<p>if you just cool it down, make it very, very cold.</p>
<p>If you put a ball somewhere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll roll down to its minimum.</p>
<p>And this happens metaphorically</p>
<p>at the energy landscape too.</p>
<p>And quantum mechanics even uses some clever tricks,</p>
<p>which today&rsquo;s machine learning systems don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re trying to find the minimum</p>
<p>and you get stuck in the little local minimum here,</p>
<p>in quantum mechanics you can actually tunnel</p>
<p>through the barrier and get unstuck again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it may be, for example,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll one day use quantum computers</p>
<p>that help train neural networks better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, so as a component of kind of the learning process,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask sort of wrapping up here a little bit,</p>
<p>let me return to the questions of our human nature</p>
<p>and love, as I mentioned.</p>
<p>So do you think,</p>
<p>you mentioned sort of a helper robot,</p>
<p>but you could think of also personal robots.</p>
<p>Do you think the way we human beings fall in love</p>
<p>and get connected to each other</p>
<p>is possible to achieve in an AI system</p>
<p>and human level AI intelligence system?</p>
<p>Do you think we would ever see that kind of connection?</p>
<p>Or, you know, in all this discussion</p>
<p>about solving complex goals,</p>
<p>is this kind of human social connection,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s one of the goals</p>
<p>on the peaks and valleys with the raising sea levels</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll be able to achieve?</p>
<p>Or do you think that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s ultimately,</p>
<p>or at least in the short term,</p>
<p>relative to the other goals is not achievable?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all possible.</p>
<p>And I mean, in recent,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very wide range of guesses, as you know,</p>
<p>among AI researchers, when we&rsquo;re going to get AGI.</p>
<p>Some people, you know, like our friend Rodney Brooks</p>
<p>says it&rsquo;s going to be hundreds of years at least.</p>
<p>And then there are many others</p>
<p>who think it&rsquo;s going to happen much sooner.</p>
<p>And recent polls,</p>
<p>maybe half or so of AI researchers</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re going to get AGI within decades.</p>
<p>So if that happens, of course,</p>
<p>then I think these things are all possible.</p>
<p>But in terms of whether it will happen,</p>
<p>I think we shouldn&rsquo;t spend so much time asking</p>
<p>what do we think will happen in the future?</p>
<p>As if we are just some sort of pathetic,</p>
<p>your passive bystanders, you know,</p>
<p>waiting for the future to happen to us.</p>
<p>Hey, we&rsquo;re the ones creating this future, right?</p>
<p>So we should be proactive about it</p>
<p>and ask ourselves what sort of future</p>
<p>we would like to have happen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make it like that.</p>
<p>Well, what I prefer is just some sort of incredibly boring,</p>
<p>zombie like future where there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>mechanical things happening and there&rsquo;s no passion,</p>
<p>no emotion, no experience, maybe even.</p>
<p>No, I would of course, much rather prefer it</p>
<p>if all the things that we find that we value the most</p>
<p>about humanity are our subjective experience,</p>
<p>passion, inspiration, love, you know.</p>
<p>If we can create a future where those things do happen,</p>
<p>where those things do exist, you know,</p>
<p>I think ultimately it&rsquo;s not our universe</p>
<p>giving meaning to us, it&rsquo;s us giving meaning to our universe.</p>
<p>And if we build more advanced intelligence,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make sure we build it in such a way</p>
<p>that meaning is part of it.</p>
<p>A lot of people that seriously study this problem</p>
<p>and think of it from different angles</p>
<p>have trouble in the majority of cases,</p>
<p>if they think through that happen,</p>
<p>are the ones that are not beneficial to humanity.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, so what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s should people, you know,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like people to be terrified.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a way for people to think about it</p>
<p>in a way we can solve it and we can make it better?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think panicking is going to help in any way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to increase chances</p>
<p>of things going well either.</p>
<p>Even if you are in a situation where there is a real threat,</p>
<p>does it help if everybody just freaks out?</p>
<p>No, of course, of course not.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, there are of course ways</p>
<p>in which things can go horribly wrong.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s important when we think about this thing,</p>
<p>about the problems and risks,</p>
<p>to also remember how huge the upsides can be</p>
<p>if we get it right, right?</p>
<p>Everything we love about society and civilization</p>
<p>is a product of intelligence.</p>
<p>So if we can amplify our intelligence</p>
<p>with machine intelligence and not anymore lose our loved one</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re told is an incurable disease</p>
<p>and things like this, of course, we should aspire to that.</p>
<p>So that can be a motivator, I think,</p>
<p>reminding ourselves that the reason we try to solve problems</p>
<p>is not just because we&rsquo;re trying to avoid gloom,</p>
<p>but because we&rsquo;re trying to do something great.</p>
<p>But then in terms of the risks,</p>
<p>I think the really important question is to ask,</p>
<p>what can we do today that will actually help</p>
<p>make the outcome good, right?</p>
<p>And dismissing the risk is not one of them.</p>
<p>I find it quite funny often when I&rsquo;m in discussion panels</p>
<p>about these things,</p>
<p>how the people who work for companies,</p>
<p>always be like, oh, nothing to worry about,</p>
<p>nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only academics sometimes express concerns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not surprising at all if you think about it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Upton Sinclair quipped, right,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to make a man believe in something</p>
<p>when his income depends on not believing in it.</p>
<p>And frankly, we know a lot of these people in companies</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just as concerned as anyone else.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re the CEO of a company,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not something you want to go on record saying</p>
<p>when you have silly journalists who are gonna put a picture</p>
<p>of a Terminator robot when they quote you.</p>
<p>So the issues are real.</p>
<p>And the way I think about what the issue is,</p>
<p>is basically the real choice we have is,</p>
<p>first of all, are we gonna just dismiss the risks</p>
<p>and say, well, let&rsquo;s just go ahead and build machines</p>
<p>that can do everything we can do better and cheaper.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just make ourselves obsolete as fast as possible.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one attitude.</p>
<p>The opposite attitude, I think, is to say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this incredible potential,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s think about what kind of future</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really, really excited about.</p>
<p>What are the shared goals that we can really aspire towards?</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s think really hard</p>
<p>about how we can actually get there.</p>
<p>So start with, don&rsquo;t start thinking about the risks,</p>
<p>start thinking about the goals.</p>
<p>And then when you do that,</p>
<p>then you can think about the obstacles you want to avoid.</p>
<p>I often get students coming in right here into my office</p>
<p>for career advice.</p>
<p>I always ask them this very question,</p>
<p>where do you want to be in the future?</p>
<p>If all she can say is, oh, maybe I&rsquo;ll have cancer,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll get run over by a truck.</p>
<p>Yeah, focus on the obstacles instead of the goals.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just going to end up a hypochondriac paranoid.</p>
<p>Whereas if she comes in and fire in her eyes</p>
<p>and is like, I want to be there.</p>
<p>And then we can talk about the obstacles</p>
<p>and see how we can circumvent them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, a much, much healthier attitude.</p>
<p>And I feel it&rsquo;s very challenging to come up with a vision</p>
<p>for the future, which we are unequivocally excited about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just talking now in the vague terms,</p>
<p>like, yeah, let&rsquo;s cure cancer, fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about what kind of society</p>
<p>do we want to create?</p>
<p>What do we want it to mean to be human in the age of AI,</p>
<p>in the age of AGI?</p>
<p>So if we can have this conversation,</p>
<p>broad, inclusive conversation,</p>
<p>and gradually start converging towards some,</p>
<p>some future that with some direction, at least,</p>
<p>that we want to steer towards, right,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll be much more motivated</p>
<p>to constructively take on the obstacles.</p>
<p>And I think if I had, if I had to,</p>
<p>if I try to wrap this up in a more succinct way,</p>
<p>I think we can all agree already now</p>
<p>that we should aspire to build AGI</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t overpower us, but that empowers us.</p>
<p>And think of the many various ways that can do that,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s from my side of the world</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally actually from the camp</p>
<p>that believes this human level intelligence</p>
<p>is required to achieve something like vehicles</p>
<p>that would actually be something we would enjoy using</p>
<p>and being part of.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one example, and certainly there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of other types of robots and medicine and so on.</p>
<p>So focusing on those and then coming up with the obstacles,</p>
<p>coming up with the ways that that can go wrong</p>
<p>and solving those one at a time.</p>
<p>And just because you can build an autonomous vehicle,</p>
<p>even if you could build one</p>
<p>that would drive just fine without you,</p>
<p>maybe there are some things in life</p>
<p>that we would actually want to do ourselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Right, like, for example,</p>
<p>if you think of our society as a whole,</p>
<p>there are some things that we find very meaningful to do.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to stop doing them</p>
<p>just because machines can do them better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna stop playing tennis</p>
<p>just the day someone builds a tennis robot and beat me.</p>
<p>People are still playing chess and even go.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in the very near term even,</p>
<p>some people are advocating basic income, replace jobs.</p>
<p>But if the government is gonna be willing</p>
<p>to just hand out cash to people for doing nothing,</p>
<p>then one should also seriously consider</p>
<p>whether the government should also hire</p>
<p>a lot more teachers and nurses</p>
<p>and the kind of jobs which people often</p>
<p>find great fulfillment in doing, right?</p>
<p>We get very tired of hearing politicians saying,</p>
<p>oh, we can&rsquo;t afford hiring more teachers,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna maybe have basic income.</p>
<p>If we can have more serious research and thought</p>
<p>into what gives meaning to our lives,</p>
<p>the jobs give so much more than income, right?</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>And then think about in the future,</p>
<p>what are the roles that we wanna have people</p>
<p>continually feeling empowered by machines?</p>
<p>And I think sort of, I come from Russia,</p>
<p>from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And I think for a lot of people in the 20th century,</p>
<p>going to the moon, going to space was an inspiring thing.</p>
<p>I feel like the universe of the mind,</p>
<p>so AI, understanding, creating intelligence</p>
<p>is that for the 21st century.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really surprising.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard you mention this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really surprising to me,</p>
<p>both on the research funding side,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not funded as greatly as it could be,</p>
<p>but most importantly, on the politician side,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not part of the public discourse</p>
<p>except in the killer bots terminator kind of view,</p>
<p>that people are not yet, I think, perhaps excited</p>
<p>by the possible positive future</p>
<p>that we can build together.</p>
<p>So we should be, because politicians usually just focus</p>
<p>on the next election cycle, right?</p>
<p>The single most important thing I feel we humans have learned</p>
<p>in the entire history of science</p>
<p>is they were the masters of underestimation.</p>
<p>We underestimated the size of our cosmos again and again,</p>
<p>realizing that everything we thought existed</p>
<p>was just a small part of something grander, right?</p>
<p>Planet, solar system, the galaxy, clusters of galaxies.</p>
<p>The universe.</p>
<p>And we now know that the future has just</p>
<p>so much more potential</p>
<p>than our ancestors could ever have dreamt of.</p>
<p>This cosmos, imagine if all of Earth</p>
<p>was completely devoid of life,</p>
<p>except for Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be kind of lame if all we ever aspired to</p>
<p>was to stay in Cambridge, Massachusetts forever</p>
<p>and then go extinct in one week,</p>
<p>even though Earth was gonna continue on for longer?</p>
<p>That sort of attitude I think we have now</p>
<p>on the cosmic scale, life can flourish on Earth,</p>
<p>not for four years, but for billions of years.</p>
<p>I can even tell you about how to move it out of harm&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>when the sun gets too hot.</p>
<p>And then we have so much more resources out here,</p>
<p>which today, maybe there are a lot of other planets</p>
<p>with bacteria or cow like life on them,</p>
<p>but most of this, all this opportunity seems,</p>
<p>as far as we can tell, to be largely dead,</p>
<p>like the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>And yet we have the opportunity to help life flourish</p>
<p>around this for billions of years.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s quit squabbling about</p>
<p>whether some little border should be drawn</p>
<p>one mile to the left or right,</p>
<p>and look up into the skies and realize,</p>
<p>hey, we can do such incredible things.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s, I think, why it&rsquo;s really exciting</p>
<p>that you and others are connected</p>
<p>with some of the work Elon Musk is doing,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s literally going out into that space,</p>
<p>really exploring our universe, and it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>That is exactly why Elon Musk is so misunderstood, right?</p>
<p>Misconstrued him as some kind of pessimistic doomsayer.</p>
<p>The reason he cares so much about AI safety</p>
<p>is because he more than almost anyone else appreciates</p>
<p>these amazing opportunities that we&rsquo;ll squander</p>
<p>if we wipe out here on Earth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just going to wipe out the next generation,</p>
<p>all generations, and this incredible opportunity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there, and that would really be a waste.</p>
<p>And AI, for people who think that it would be better</p>
<p>to do without technology, let me just mention that</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t improve our technology,</p>
<p>the question isn&rsquo;t whether humanity is going to go extinct.</p>
<p>The question is just whether we&rsquo;re going to get taken out</p>
<p>by the next big asteroid or the next super volcano</p>
<p>or something else dumb that we could easily prevent</p>
<p>with more tech, right?</p>
<p>And if we want life to flourish throughout the cosmos,</p>
<p>AI is the key to it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a lot of detail in my book right there,</p>
<p>even many of the most inspired sci fi writers,</p>
<p>I feel have totally underestimated the opportunities</p>
<p>for space travel, especially at the other galaxies,</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t thinking about the possibility of AGI,</p>
<p>which just makes it so much easier.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>So that goes to your view of AGI that enables our progress,</p>
<p>that enables a better life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to put it</p>
<p>and then something to strive for.</p>
<p>So Max, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Have a great day.</p>
