    <p>Hey, listeners, before I get into today&rsquo;s story, I just want to give a massive thank</p>
<p>you to all of you because today marks the one-year anniversary of The Deck.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support of this podcast as we dive every week into a new cold case.</p>
<p>And what I love most is that you all don&rsquo;t just listen to these cases.</p>
<p>You are taking action, like with that letter-writing campaign we did for Awachiki Osceola that</p>
<p>got the Oklahoma AG&rsquo;s office to re-examine her case, or the tips that you&rsquo;ve called</p>
<p>in to several of these investigating agencies, or even the cases that you&rsquo;ve recommended</p>
<p>for us to cover.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>I appreciate all of you, and I can&rsquo;t believe that we&rsquo;ve been doing this for a whole year.</p>
<p>Honestly, it seems like just yesterday that I was dreaming up this podcast where we at</p>
<p>Audiocheck could do our own original reporting and shed light on the coldest of cold cases.</p>
<p>And here we are, 52 cases later.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t say it enough.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And without further ado, let&rsquo;s get into today&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Our card this week is Oki Alkite, the Nine of Hearts from Colorado.</p>
<p>There are certain cases that I obsess over.</p>
<p>The ones that dig their way under my skin and keep me up at night, or just pop into</p>
<p>my head in the middle of the day unannounced, banging on my conscious, demanding answers.</p>
<p>And the 2004 case of Alkite is one of those.</p>
<p>This case is the definition of a mystery.</p>
<p>And for over 18 years, investigators have looked at this case from every angle, trying</p>
<p>to track down an elusive killer, but they have been stumped at every turn.</p>
<p>However, technology is changing, and investigators hope that that means their luck is changing</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was mid-morning on Monday, May 24, 2004, when a man named Philip was just realizing</p>
<p>that one of his employees, Al, hadn&rsquo;t come into work.</p>
<p>They both worked in the office of a construction company in Aurora, Colorado, and Al was never</p>
<p>late.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d been in accounting for years and took a lot of pride in his job, so his absence</p>
<p>stuck out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>He went to his other co-workers, who, after a few hours, started to worry too.</p>
<p>At some point that morning, they decided to go ahead and call his landline just to check</p>
<p>on him and make sure that he was okay, but no one picked up.</p>
<p>They tried his cell phone next, and this time, someone did answer, but it wasn&rsquo;t Al.</p>
<p>The man on the other end said that his name was Joe, and he had the phone because he found</p>
<p>it on top of a payphone in the neighboring city of Denver the night before.</p>
<p>It was at that point that Philip was convinced that something was wrong with Al.</p>
<p>The guy on the other end of the phone, Joe, offered to meet up with Philip and give him</p>
<p>the phone if he wanted, so Philip and another one of his employees went to meet this guy</p>
<p>at a Safeway grocery store in Denver.</p>
<p>When they got there, they learned Joe was experiencing homelessness and wanted to sell</p>
<p>the phone back to them.</p>
<p>Ten bucks got the deal done, and once they went their separate ways, Philip and the other</p>
<p>employee immediately started going through the phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what they were looking for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if they even knew what they were looking for.</p>
<p>But eventually, they found Al&rsquo;s contacts and came across his sister, Barbara.</p>
<p>So they called her to try and get some answers about where Al was, but she didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>was going on either.</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t seen or spoken to Al recently, and she actually lived in Virginia, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like she could just meet up with them and help figure things out.</p>
<p>But she did think that they were right to be concerned, so she suggested that they call</p>
<p>the police to do a welfare check.</p>
<p>Both Philip and Barbara called the Aurora Police Department, and by 4 p.m., two officers</p>
<p>arrived at Al&rsquo;s townhome to poke around.</p>
<p>Al lived in this area called Chambers Ridge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s middle class and kind of the residential center of Aurora at the time.</p>
<p>It was also a really low crime neighborhood, so at least outside, they weren&rsquo;t surprised</p>
<p>to see that everything was normal.</p>
<p>Al&rsquo;s front door was locked and the windows were secure, same with the garage door out</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>They went back to the front door and knocked, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>They knocked again, still nothing.</p>
<p>By then, I&rsquo;m not sure what they were thinking.</p>
<p>Maybe that Al had a medical emergency and needed help, or maybe there would be something</p>
<p>inside that could clue them in as to his whereabouts.</p>
<p>But basically, they called Barbara back and asked for her permission to enter his house,</p>
<p>to which she said yes.</p>
<p>They had to pick the lock, but once they got the door open, they stepped inside.</p>
<p>And again, everything looked totally normal.</p>
<p>Al was a rather organized person, so all of his stuff in the small living room space,</p>
<p>bedroom, and bathroom was neatly put away and looked untouched.</p>
<p>But when the officers got to the kitchen, they noticed something a little strange.</p>
<p>All of the knives from a butcher block on the counter and a set of keys were soaking</p>
<p>in the sink, and the liquid that they were soaking in smelled a lot like bleach.</p>
<p>Unsure yet what they were dealing with, officers didn&rsquo;t touch the knives, and they continued</p>
<p>through the house, making their way towards the basement.</p>
<p>Down there, they found a finished space like this little living room.</p>
<p>There was a bathroom, a storage closet, and then another room.</p>
<p>But what was once probably a bedroom didn&rsquo;t look like a bedroom anymore.</p>
<p>It looked like a scene from a horror movie.</p>
<p>There was blood everywhere.</p>
<p>It was splattered on the walls, and it was pooled on the carpet floor, and it was even</p>
<p>spotted across the ceiling.</p>
<p>And there, in the middle of all of it, was Al.</p>
<p>He was fully clothed, lying face down on the floor with his feet slightly under a bed frame</p>
<p>in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>His head and upper torso were covered by a small blue bath mat.</p>
<p>But one look at him among the carnage told the officers that he was already deceased.</p>
<p>They removed the mat, and it was immediately clear that the majority of the damage on Al&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body had been done to his head and upper torso.</p>
<p>What they could see of his face was bruised and covered in bloody injuries that continued</p>
<p>down to his neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>He had one huge laceration on the back of his head, and based on pieces of drywall scattered</p>
<p>around his body, they believed that at some point the killer had swung a knife so hard</p>
<p>at Al that they had hit the wall on the follow-through, which caused it to chip off.</p>
<p>His throat had also been cut so deep that it looked like he was almost decapitated.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection of his body, they found what looked like ligature marks on his arms</p>
<p>and legs.</p>
<p>And as they scanned the room, there wasn&rsquo;t any sign of whatever had restrained him.</p>
<p>But they did notice a mattress leaned up against the wall, covering the only window in the</p>
<p>room, with two pillows tucked between it and the window to make sure that nobody could</p>
<p>see in.</p>
<p>Once they confirmed Al was deceased, and that there was no one else in the house, officers</p>
<p>exited the townhome and called their supervisor.</p>
<p>And it was around this time that Agent Tom Sobieski with the Aurora Police Department</p>
<p>was assigned to the case with two other detectives.</p>
<p>Once all three of them arrived to the scene, though, they quickly realized that none of</p>
<p>them had ever handled a case like this before.</p>
<p>We actually called the Arapahoe County coroner to the scene because this was something that</p>
<p>we had never seen before.</p>
<p>So he walked in there and I walked in there.</p>
<p>We walked down the stairs directly to the victim.</p>
<p>And we had a CSI person with us and we took video and photographed and then we removed</p>
<p>the victim from the scene without processing everything else.</p>
<p>And he went to the coroner&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Once Al had been removed, they were able to do a more thorough search of his home, starting</p>
<p>with the basement bedroom.</p>
<p>And that was when Agent Sobieski found about a quarter inch of rope on the carpet near</p>
<p>where Al&rsquo;s body had been.</p>
<p>Considering where it was found, Agent Sobieski believed that the killer had likely used rope</p>
<p>to restrain Al, and maybe he just missed that little bit when they were cleaning up.</p>
<p>Other than all the blood, and there was a lot of blood, there wasn&rsquo;t much more in</p>
<p>the way of physical evidence there in the basement bedroom.</p>
<p>They searched what remained of the lower level and didn&rsquo;t find a scrap of evidence</p>
<p>in any of the other rooms, so they decided to go back upstairs.</p>
<p>But just as they were heading up the stairs to the first level of the townhome, something</p>
<p>caught their eye.</p>
<p>It was what looked like a blood transfer spot on the very bottom step, and it stuck out</p>
<p>to them because it was the only visible trace of blood outside of the bedroom.</p>
<p>So they collected a sample of that, too, before they headed upstairs.</p>
<p>Next, they took a close look at all those knives in the sink, and confirmed that they</p>
<p>were in fact soaking in a mixture of water and bleach, which immediately dashed any hope</p>
<p>of getting evidence off of them.</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t left without any clues in the kitchen.</p>
<p>When they checked the keys in the sink, they discovered that they unlocked Al&rsquo;s front</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p>Now, they weren&rsquo;t sure yet if those were Al&rsquo;s main set of keys, or maybe a spare</p>
<p>or what, but at least they knew what they went to.</p>
<p>So then they moved on to the trash, and in there, they found a signed rental agreement</p>
<p>for that basement living space where Al was just found.</p>
<p>It seems like Al was going to be renting it out, and a man named Robert Cooper had signed</p>
<p>a lease for it.</p>
<p>The document was dated almost a week before, May 18th, and even though there weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>any personal items in the basement to suggest that someone had already moved in, officers</p>
<p>started to wonder if they should be looking for a roommate.</p>
<p>In the trash, they also found one of Al&rsquo;s bank statements.</p>
<p>It was kind of torn up, but that&rsquo;s okay because the statement itself wasn&rsquo;t what</p>
<p>was important.</p>
<p>They were interested in a note that Al had scribbled near the top of the paper.</p>
<p>It was a phone number along with the name Robert.</p>
<p>They figured it had to be the same Robert from the rental agreement, so they assigned</p>
<p>someone to go track this guy down.</p>
<p>While all of this was solid evidence to have, it was really the things that they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find that stood out to them the most.</p>
<p>For instance, Al&rsquo;s wallet and vehicle were both missing, and they couldn&rsquo;t find a container</p>
<p>where the bleach in the sink came from.</p>
<p>Some of the towels in the bathroom were missing, which made them think that the killer had</p>
<p>taken a shower or maybe cleaned up before they left.</p>
<p>Police also didn&rsquo;t find evidence that Al owned rope or any other items that could have</p>
<p>been used to restrain him or caused his injuries besides the knives, so they began to suspect</p>
<p>that the killer might have brought a sort of murder kit with him.</p>
<p>And chillingly, they noticed some clothes missing as well.</p>
<p>Okie was very, I mean, everything was in its place from his office to his closet, and there</p>
<p>was one pair of pants missing, one shirt missing from his closet, and we couldn&rsquo;t find just</p>
<p>the empty hangers.</p>
<p>This indicated that the killer had likely changed out of whatever they were wearing</p>
<p>and left Al&rsquo;s house wearing the clothes of the man that they had just murdered.</p>
<p>Now I also want to point out that a lot of the online buzz about this case says that</p>
<p>the killer slept at Al&rsquo;s, but Agent Sobieski said that that wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Obviously he spent a lot of time in the home during and after the murder, but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find a trace of evidence that indicates the killer slept there at any point.</p>
<p>With their initial search completed, Agent Sobieski told us that their next step was</p>
<p>to canvas the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But just as they were getting ready to head out, a neighbor actually came right to them</p>
<p>with a tip.</p>
<p>They knew where Al&rsquo;s car was.</p>
<p>The neighbor told Agent Sobieski and the other officers at the scene that they were just</p>
<p>driving home for the day when they noticed Al&rsquo;s GMC pickup truck parked about a block</p>
<p>and a half down the road from his place.</p>
<p>They said that they didn&rsquo;t think much of it initially, but then when they pulled around</p>
<p>the corner and saw all the cops at his home, they decided to pull up and say something.</p>
<p>So Agent Sobieski sent a team of officers to find the truck, and sure enough, it was</p>
<p>right there where the neighbor said it was.</p>
<p>And then a canvas was done of where Al&rsquo;s truck was found because it&rsquo;s parked right in front</p>
<p>of a whole row of townhomes and apartments, and nobody saw anything there that was substantial.</p>
<p>They thought it&rsquo;d been there a couple days.</p>
<p>When the officers got into the vehicle, they didn&rsquo;t find anything significant right off</p>
<p>the bat.</p>
<p>Again, Al was an organized guy, and that extended to his truck.</p>
<p>But as they looked closer, they noticed one thing that stood out.</p>
<p>There were a few strands of medium-toned brown hair.</p>
<p>Now Al did have darker hair, but the 53-year-old had developed a lot of grays, too, kind of</p>
<p>a salt-and-pepper look.</p>
<p>So whoever&rsquo;s hair this was, it likely wasn&rsquo;t Al&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And since they weren&rsquo;t aware of anyone else having access to his truck, Agent Sobieski</p>
<p>suspected that this could be the killer&rsquo;s hair, so they took samples to test later.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening, investigators talked to as many people as they could to learn more</p>
<p>about Al and the people he associated with.</p>
<p>Investigators told officers that they hadn&rsquo;t heard or seen anything suspicious the entire</p>
<p>weekend, and friends and family were able to give them names of his best friend as well</p>
<p>as a former roommate who had just moved out a month prior.</p>
<p>Although no one was aware if Al had ever had issues with either of them.</p>
<p>And when it came to Al himself, everyone had the same things to say.</p>
<p>Al was a very well-liked man.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find anybody that would say a bad thing about him.</p>
<p>He was divorced.</p>
<p>He joined some singles clubs.</p>
<p>He recently had a new girlfriend.</p>
<p>He liked NASCAR.</p>
<p>He liked hanging out and watching NASCAR on Sundays.</p>
<p>Other than that, he was a hard worker.</p>
<p>He traveled the world pretty much as an accountant.</p>
<p>Al&rsquo;s loved ones told investigators that he loved to cook.</p>
<p>He was always a gentleman.</p>
<p>He had great relationships with all of his neighbors, and just like Agent Sobieski said,</p>
<p>he had just started a new relationship with his girlfriend Linda.</p>
<p>Because Al was so well-liked and so well-known, his murder was a total shock to his community.</p>
<p>Again, this area was not used to even petty crimes, much less such an intense act of violence.</p>
<p>And while people were devastated about Al, they were also unsettled by something else.</p>
<p>Whoever did this to him, they were still out there.</p>
<p>Detectives were thinking the same thing, so they were pulling on whatever loose thread</p>
<p>they could find to try and unravel some answers.</p>
<p>And their strongest lead so far was still this mystery roommate, Robert Cooper.</p>
<p>And luckily, the people that they interviewed were able to shed some light on this guy.</p>
<p>It turned out that Al had talked about him quite a bit to his friends and family.</p>
<p>Neighbors were told that Robert had responded to Al&rsquo;s rental ad for the basement space</p>
<p>and agreed to be the new tenant.</p>
<p>Al told people that Robert was from the East Coast and transferred to Aurora with Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>One person was even able to remember exactly which Wells Fargo Al had mentioned.</p>
<p>It was the one that was only about six minutes from Al&rsquo;s townhome.</p>
<p>Yet another neighbor even claimed to have seen who they believed to be Robert.</p>
<p>They said that several days before the murder, they noticed a man with a cane walking into</p>
<p>Al&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>He had dark hair, he was well-dressed, and he looked to be maybe in his early 50s.</p>
<p>Now even if this Robert guy had nothing to do with Al&rsquo;s murder, Agent Sobieski still</p>
<p>had men on his team trying to track this guy down, because witness or suspect, either way,</p>
<p>he could hold valuable information.</p>
<p>But as their search for him continued, Al&rsquo;s autopsy results came back and uncovered the</p>
<p>true horror of what he had gone through.</p>
<p>Now before I even go into the autopsy, I just want to say that what Al endured is going</p>
<p>to be hard to hear.</p>
<p>But I think it is important to include as much detail as we can without getting too</p>
<p>graphic in order to show you what kind of monster the investigators are looking for.</p>
<p>And I personally think that this MO seems so specific that maybe the key to catching</p>
<p>this guy is in the details.</p>
<p>So that being said, the first thing that stood out to the coroner was the sheer amount of</p>
<p>ligature marks on Al&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Once he removed his clothing and analyzed the full extent of the marks, he determined</p>
<p>Al had been hog-tied with rope, likely the same kind of rope as that small piece found</p>
<p>near his body.</p>
<p>We actually had, we simulated how the markings were on, from the bruising of the ropes, arms</p>
<p>behind his back, legs tied together, his ankles tied to his wrists, and they were wrapped</p>
<p>several times, and there was different cross patterns.</p>
<p>It would take over 40 foot of rope to do that.</p>
<p>It was quite an elaborate pattern, it was all perfectly spaced out, and the crosses</p>
<p>where the ropes crossed were all perfect, so I&rsquo;m sure that was part of the ritual or</p>
<p>the thrill of the suspect got.</p>
<p>The position would have left Al&rsquo;s feet exposed, and the coroner found that they were severely</p>
<p>bruised from having been beaten.</p>
<p>Severe bruising of different sizes on the rest of his body also indicated that he was</p>
<p>beaten with several different blunt objects, but that wasn&rsquo;t even the worst of it, not</p>
<p>by far.</p>
<p>Al had a total of 11 stab wounds on his body, in his ears, in his eyes, on the tops of his</p>
<p>shoulders and his upper torso.</p>
<p>The coroner at the time thought that the torture went on for several hours because it had time</p>
<p>for his eyes to bruise and actually close shut, and with the blood evidence in the room,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re dead, your heart&rsquo;s not beating, you&rsquo;re not throwing blood all over.</p>
<p>So it went on for several hours.</p>
<p>The knife wounds were so deep, the coroner determined it would have taken an immense</p>
<p>amount of force to do that kind of damage.</p>
<p>But despite how disturbing it was, Agent Sobieski was hopeful that this particular</p>
<p>act of violence might be the killer&rsquo;s undoing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re cutting somebody and stabbing them with kitchen knives and they get bloody, any</p>
<p>investigator will tell you that your hand slips up to the blade of the knife and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>cut yourself.</p>
<p>And with the number of cuts and the stab wounds, we felt that he had to have done it, had to</p>
<p>have cut himself.</p>
<p>There was also the gaping laceration on the back of Al&rsquo;s head that the officers who first</p>
<p>found him had seen.</p>
<p>But you see, none of those wounds ended up being fatal.</p>
<p>It was the cut to his throat that the coroner believed finally ended his suffering and his</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>So my theory is we had a witness who saw Robert Cooper walking with a cane go into Okeechite&rsquo;s</p>
<p>townhome a few days prior, probably the day he rented the place.</p>
<p>With the injuries, the lacerations to the back of his head, I think Okeechite may have</p>
<p>been walking down the stairs in front of him and he starts striking him with this cane,</p>
<p>causing those large lacerations.</p>
<p>I think there was two or three of them to the back of his head.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it knocked him unconscious, but it might get him to submit, you know,</p>
<p>to being tied up.</p>
<p>The coroner declared the manner of death as homicide, but it was the time of death that</p>
<p>was a little trickier to figure out.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t determine an exact time, but they knew that he had been dead for at least</p>
<p>a day.</p>
<p>So combine that with the fact that they knew he had been at work on Friday, well, that</p>
<p>narrowed it down to some point between Friday afternoon and Monday morning.</p>
<p>That is a lot of time to try and cover.</p>
<p>So if they couldn&rsquo;t narrow in on a small window, they would narrow in on what the autopsy</p>
<p>told them about their killer.</p>
<p>We wanted to get as many people that were in his inner circle, coworkers, friends, family,</p>
<p>because the amount of torture that Al had, we knew the suspect would probably have cuts</p>
<p>to his hands from punching or from the knives.</p>
<p>So we checked everybody&rsquo;s hands, looked for injuries, got alibis for everybody.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski talked to his former roommate, but they didn&rsquo;t have anything useful to add,</p>
<p>and that person didn&rsquo;t have any noticeable injuries.</p>
<p>Tom also talked with Al&rsquo;s ex-wife, but the same thing, and she was quickly cleared too.</p>
<p>They were on good terms, and she no longer lived in Colorado.</p>
<p>We had no information that she had been back or that there was any bad blood between them</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski just kept going down his list.</p>
<p>And next was Al&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
<p>And this guy actually said that he had been with Al on Saturday.</p>
<p>He said that he was working with Al on a construction project in Denver, but they wanted to go out</p>
<p>that night.</p>
<p>So they decided to wrap things up at around three and go home and get cleaned up.</p>
<p>Just before they went their separate ways, he said that Al told him he was also meeting</p>
<p>with his new roommate before they went out.</p>
<p>And of course, Agent Sobieski&rsquo;s ears perk up at hearing this.</p>
<p>But he still just doesn&rsquo;t know enough about this Robert guy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s even more interested when Al&rsquo;s friend says that was the last time he saw Al, because</p>
<p>Al never showed up for their plans that night.</p>
<p>The next person that Agent Sobieski wants to go talk to was Linda, Al&rsquo;s new girlfriend.</p>
<p>And little did he know that she would actually be the one that could give him the most information</p>
<p>yet on Robert Cooper.</p>
<p>Linda told Agent Sobieski that she had also last heard from Al on Saturday, sometime between</p>
<p>3.30 and 4.</p>
<p>She had had a flight out of town that morning, and he had taken her to the airport.</p>
<p>On their way, they had decided to officially become boyfriend and girlfriend since they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been seeing each other for a couple of months.</p>
<p>So when Linda finished her travel and got to her hotel, she called just to check in</p>
<p>with him.</p>
<p>Now, he picked up the phone, but she said that something felt off.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t really tell why at the time, but when she learned what had happened to</p>
<p>Al, she believed that Al&rsquo;s killer was in the house as they were speaking.</p>
<p>She said he seemed different.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t seem like himself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember her exact wording, but she thought there was something different about</p>
<p>him when she talked to him.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, and it&rsquo;s just my opinion, there is no way that a killer who went to</p>
<p>this elaborate scenario to set this all up would ever let him talk on the phone for any</p>
<p>reason to anyone, because he says two words to her and, you know, call 911 or help me</p>
<p>or whatever, and suddenly he&rsquo;s got to leave, the police are coming or whatever.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see that as a scenario at all.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the killer was in the house by then or not, the call and Al&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>friend&rsquo;s interview were important because it let the coroner know that Al was at least</p>
<p>alive at 4 p.m. on Saturday.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski also asked Linda if she knew anything about a guy named Robert, and just</p>
<p>like so many other people he&rsquo;d spoken to, she was like, oh yeah, his new roommate.</p>
<p>Not only did she know about this guy, but she also said she saw him too.</p>
<p>Linda said that on May 8th, she went over to Al&rsquo;s, and when she arrived, Al was giving</p>
<p>Robert a tour of the basement.</p>
<p>She called out to Al to let him know that she was there, and he called back that Robert</p>
<p>was there, and he wanted them to meet.</p>
<p>Now she needed to use the restroom first, and by the time she got out, all she caught</p>
<p>was just a little glimpse of Robert going out the front door.</p>
<p>As soon as he hears another witness, he&rsquo;s getting out of there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he told Al to leave that quick, but from the time she went up the stairs</p>
<p>till she came out of the bathroom, he&rsquo;s up and out, going out the door.</p>
<p>From the quick look that she got, Linda was able to give a vague description of the man</p>
<p>she saw.</p>
<p>She said he was white, had dark brown hair, he was well-dressed in a suit and tie, and</p>
<p>notably he didn&rsquo;t have a cane.</p>
<p>Now she was also able to confirm that Robert had gone back to Al&rsquo;s to sign that rental</p>
<p>agreement on the 18th, and when he was there, he paid $1,000 for half a month&rsquo;s rent and</p>
<p>a deposit, and he took a key to the house.</p>
<p>When she describes the key that he took, investigators are certain that it is part of the same ones</p>
<p>that they found in the sink.</p>
<p>But what struck her as odd was that after he left, he didn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>Like he had had a key, he had paid, he just never showed up again, at least not to move</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>Now this is definitely weird, and when Al talked to Linda about it, he said something</p>
<p>about some furniture that Robert had that wouldn&rsquo;t fit down the stairs, so he was like</p>
<p>waiting to figure it out.</p>
<p>And I know that&rsquo;s super vague, but Linda told Agent Sobieski that she couldn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>the exact details of that conversation, so we&rsquo;ll never really know what Robert&rsquo;s excuse</p>
<p>was for the delay in moving in.</p>
<p>Either way, at this point, investigators were convinced that Robert had something to do</p>
<p>with Al&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So the first week of their investigation was a mad dash to just track this guy down.</p>
<p>They obviously started with that rental agreement, which, besides his full name, included Robert&rsquo;s</p>
<p>address.</p>
<p>He also had two references, there was a social security number, a driver&rsquo;s license number.</p>
<p>But every single thing on there turned out to be bogus.</p>
<p>The address was an elementary school about 24 minutes from Al&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The references were made-up names.</p>
<p>The social security number led them to an 81-year-old woman named Veronica who was living</p>
<p>in the Midwest.</p>
<p>And the driver&rsquo;s license number didn&rsquo;t even lead them to a real person, it was just a</p>
<p>jumble of numbers.</p>
<p>The name Robert Cooper was almost definitely fake, too.</p>
<p>But for the sake of clarity, I am going to continue using it when referring to the suspect.</p>
<p>So the only thing about this document that seemed to be legit was the date written at</p>
<p>the top.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s handwriting wrote the date 5-18-04 up in the right top corner of that application</p>
<p>is I guess when he completed it.</p>
<p>We did handwriting analysis on it and they could tell us based on, we gave them samples</p>
<p>of Al&rsquo;s handwriting, back then everything was handwritten, and they could tell us what</p>
<p>on that application form that the victim had filled out.</p>
<p>And then the rest of it was filled out by Robert Cooper.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t tell me if it was right-handed, left-handed, or anything.</p>
<p>Now if you are screaming at me right now, yelling, call the number on the bank statement,</p>
<p>please, already done and looked into.</p>
<p>And like everything else about Robert Cooper, it&rsquo;s smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>The phone wasn&rsquo;t in service anymore.</p>
<p>And when they got the records, they learned that it was attached to an AT&amp;T cell phone</p>
<p>and was registered at the same fake address that Robert put on the rental agreement.</p>
<p>Now the phone was prepaid for 90 days of use, but this isn&rsquo;t a total bust because along</p>
<p>with getting the records on Robert&rsquo;s phone, they had also requested Al&rsquo;s cell phone</p>
<p>records and his landline records.</p>
<p>And those showed that both cell phones were used after Al&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Detectives were so grateful for this data because even though they had Al&rsquo;s cell in</p>
<p>their possession, as far as physical evidence went, it was kind of a bust.</p>
<p>The screen was cracked, it had been damaged, and the guy named Joe had handled it and two</p>
<p>co-workers had touched everything, trying to find phone numbers.</p>
<p>So forensically, it was not worth doing anything to.</p>
<p>So looking at Robert&rsquo;s data first, a lot of the usage on the phone after the murder</p>
<p>were calls.</p>
<p>A lot of them to the same number, which they learned belonged to a woman living in West</p>
<p>Denver.</p>
<p>We do a traffic stop on her, we confront her with, you know, who&rsquo;s this guy who&rsquo;s calling</p>
<p>you?</p>
<p>He could be a suspect in a murder.</p>
<p>And she tells us that it&rsquo;s a homeless man that she knows that lives at the Good Samaritan</p>
<p>homeless shelter in downtown Denver.</p>
<p>So we get a description of him, he doesn&rsquo;t match the Robert that we were looking for.</p>
<p>They did track down the man just to be sure, though, and they learned that his name was</p>
<p>Acid Rio Rios.</p>
<p>He was Latino and much older than even the oldest description of Robert.</p>
<p>He had gotten the cell phone from a local guy who was known in the area for selling</p>
<p>goods at low cost to people experiencing homelessness.</p>
<p>But when Agent Sobieski asked him for the phone, Acid said that he couldn&rsquo;t give it</p>
<p>to them.</p>
<p>He said once the phone quit working, he threw it in the Platte River, so we never did recover</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>They tried to track down the guy Acid said sold him the phone.</p>
<p>But after doing so, they determined that he wasn&rsquo;t involved at all either.</p>
<p>And Al&rsquo;s phone usage after the murder was a dead end as well, because investigators</p>
<p>already knew that the activity that they were seeing on the phone records was from that</p>
<p>man named Joe, who had sold the phone back to Al&rsquo;s boss after he&rsquo;d found it.</p>
<p>But the fact that both cell phones, Okie Kite&rsquo;s and Robert Cooper&rsquo;s cell phones, got into</p>
<p>the hands of homeless people threw us off for a week during the investigation, because</p>
<p>we had detectives writing court orders for phone numbers for both phones trying to figure</p>
<p>out who our victim was calling and who our suspect was calling.</p>
<p>Well, it was because the homeless people had these phones and they were letting other people</p>
<p>use them and it really messed us up for a week.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;d have known that, we would have, we could have been doing a lot of other things.</p>
<p>But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the phone was a dead end by any means.</p>
<p>Phone records from before the murder show Robert had called Al 10 times over several</p>
<p>weeks, but Al hadn&rsquo;t been the only one.</p>
<p>Robert had made dozens of calls, all to people who had spaces available to rent.</p>
<p>Agent Sobieski took on the tedious task of contacting every single number, which ended</p>
<p>up being over 100 calls to people renting out their homes, and he found some interesting</p>
<p>connections between them.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to have to tell you about that in part two, which you can listen to right now.</p>
