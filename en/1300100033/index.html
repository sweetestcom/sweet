    <p>we are live</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>thank you very much for</p>
<p>tuning into the podcast</p>
<p>once again my friend</p>
<p>brian red band of course as always</p>
<p>and today joining</p>
<p>us the wonderful and talented mr dane cook</p>
<p>talk joke don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>it chris before we get going</p>
<p>i have to thank our sponsor the</p>
<p>flashlight if you ever use one of these things</p>
<p>i fuck with these i have not feel that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fantastic oh my god oh brian</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to lay in the</p>
<p>background okay you guys can&rsquo;t hear it but my</p>
<p>my computer&rsquo;s volume is on of course</p>
<p>but this is a sponsor of our show you supposed to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little button right in the middle brian</p>
<p>the upper level around round thing</p>
<p>is it off okay</p>
<p>was it off yeah looks like it&rsquo;s off powerful</p>
<p>anyway the idea first of all why</p>
<p>well they offered to</p>
<p>sponsor the show and i said why not you know</p>
<p>no but why in the shape of the flashlight</p>
<p>why is there a</p>
<p>why is it a</p>
<p>flashlight i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what makes it easier to hold so you can fuck it easier</p>
<p>okay and then</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re once you&rsquo;re done and you ejaculate</p>
<p>can you open that that&rsquo;s what i said</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s why i say yeah</p>
<p>you unscrew the bottom and release the</p>
<p>crack of shame</p>
<p>it just slithers out</p>
<p>into the sink</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like something i love is that it is more</p>
<p>shameful for</p>
<p>some reason than masturbating it feels way better</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>shameful like</p>
<p>i always joke</p>
<p>that as i&rsquo;m coming i&rsquo;m regretting it as i&rsquo;m coming like</p>
<p>does it also serve as a flashlight</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t light up in case it&rsquo;s not a flashlight</p>
<p>it should have little</p>
<p>lasers pointer</p>
<p>flashlights or something like that</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a silly little piece of shit by the way</p>
<p>talking about flashlights but it&rsquo;s awesome they</p>

<p>people on the</p>
<p>radio were like she was lip syncing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think she was i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>she was she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t doing that and singing anyways is</p>
<p>ridiculous if</p>
<p>she really was doing that you know she just fell</p>
<p>doing that shit i saw that</p>
<p>video yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s scariest but not only fell but when she fell</p>
<p>the wire pulled her</p>
<p>and pulled it to the very</p>
<p>until it was</p>
<p>taut and i thought if that snapped it</p>
<p>could have cut her head off totally</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>the most popular</p>
<p>video on how</p>
<p>crazy would that have been</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>watching pink</p>
<p>get her head cut off decapitated</p>
<p>could you imagine if that was a real</p>
<p>viral video</p>
<p>wow and then the sales will go up</p>
<p>cause isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>everything posthumous like yeah</p>
<p>giant huge huge</p>
<p>anytime you die even if you were mediocre</p>
<p>when you die you were a little bit better than mediocre</p>
<p>everybody loves you everybody goes</p>
<p>crazy they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna hear you</p>
<p>again so they go nuts</p>
<p>and buy your shit even though they forgot about you</p>
<p>look at michael</p>
<p>jackson who&rsquo;s by the way incredibly brilliant talented</p>
<p>but what after he died man everybody</p>
<p>went fucking nuts everybody went nuts to buy a shit</p>
<p>i thought it was fake for a bit</p>
<p>actually yeah</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m kinda like i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always like alright</p>
<p>these guys heresy theorist</p>
<p>a little bit man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i thought that you know he&rsquo;d pop out like six</p>
<p>months later</p>
<p>you know because he needed</p>
<p>something he needed</p>
<p>the love back man there was a lot of people that were</p>
<p>not feeling michael jackson for a long time i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anybody&rsquo;s ever even</p>
<p>tried to pull that</p>
<p>death off i</p>
<p>think if you</p>
<p>tried to die and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a federal crime</p>
<p>i think if you</p>
<p>think really yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re allowed to do that</p>
<p>you know i mean even as a publicity</p>
<p>stunt you would have to have medical records</p>
<p>and if you have medical records and people are</p>
<p>gonna find out they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist if you&rsquo;re faking it</p>
<p>true i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you can do it the</p>
<p>whole tupac</p>
<p>thing is ridiculous how it&rsquo;s gotten that fucking elvis</p>
<p>too man so all um</p>
<p>elvis back then</p>
<p>maybe you could pull it off</p>
<p>you know they killed jfk</p>
<p>they could probably fuck</p>
<p>elvis up well that was the whole</p>
<p>thing is that everybody said</p>
<p>elvis faked his</p>
<p>death to get away from the kernel to live a normal</p>
<p>life because the kernel was like this megalomaniac</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that hilarious</p>
<p>people are so romantic</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize that when you get to be</p>
<p>elvis famous you are guaranteed</p>
<p>fucking insane</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s no way you can get away from it</p>
<p>elvis beck this is back before the internet</p>
<p>is back you know i mean terrible</p>
<p>movies he was doing</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>leave his house</p>
<p>right even walk down the street</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>would see him they</p>
<p>would start</p>
<p>screaming and fall to</p>
<p>their knees yeah</p>
<p>my favorite</p>
<p>elvis story that i</p>
<p>heard was at the height of</p>
<p>you know everybody loving and hating</p>
<p>elvis those</p>
<p>buttons came out</p>
<p>you know i love</p>
<p>elvis and then the i hate</p>
<p>elvis pins came out</p>
<p>he made those</p>
<p>give me the kernel</p>
<p>came up with that they sold more i hate elvis pins</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard of a</p>
<p>bunch of people doing that or</p>
<p>stealing that</p>
<p>exact same idea that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s so awesome</p>
<p>you know the elvis</p>
<p>thing must be so sucky</p>
<p>if you were</p>
<p>a dude back then how the fuck do you compete with elvis</p>
<p>your girl is</p>
<p>screaming and yelling</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fucking her and you know she really</p>
<p>would way rather be</p>
<p>fucking elvis</p>
<p>all you can really</p>
<p>do is just play into it and just tell her you love</p>
<p>elvis and take her to</p>
<p>elvis and like just try to make her</p>
<p>elvis fantasy</p>
<p>come to fruition</p>
<p>yeah put on the fucking wig the whole deal</p>
<p>mutton chops</p>
<p>those elvis</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an elvis clip</p>
<p>when he was really he was really</p>
<p>fucked up he was doing whatever drugs he was doing</p>
<p>and he was bored</p>
<p>and he was not remembering the</p>
<p>lyrics and there&rsquo;s a gig he was doing in hawaii</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>bored and you</p>
<p>watch this he&rsquo;s not singing any of the lyrics</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>inside jokes with his band members and then he does the</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>he slowly backs up slowly during this one song to his</p>
<p>three backup singers</p>
<p>and in the middle of talking he just turns and</p>
<p>screams in their faces and scares the shit out of them</p>
<p>like literally turns it goes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all like</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re trying to sing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he was gone yeah</p>
<p>yeah he was gone</p>
<p>he was way too big</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get that</p>
<p>big it&rsquo;s not safe big and he was like so and i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kind of a huge</p>
<p>elvis fan and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one documentary that</p>
<p>priscilla actually did years ago</p>
<p>based on what she wrote</p>
<p>where she finally talked</p>
<p>about how insecure</p>
<p>he really was</p>
<p>he had his buddies</p>
<p>living with him and shit</p>
<p>and if they</p>
<p>wanted to go out to a dinner and he was by himself</p>
<p>he would freak out he would</p>
<p>shoot tvs up</p>
<p>he had to have his friends around him 24 7</p>
<p>wow joe you kind of have that</p>
<p>whole entourage you want a gang of people</p>
<p>this reminds us of you joe</p>
<p>you know like we used to always roll with huge</p>
<p>groups of people</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t too problematic</p>
<p>yeah but you prefer that kind of well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>more fun to have a</p>
<p>bunch of guys</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re friends with that go to you in gigs</p>
<p>but if you have too many</p>
<p>and you have to manage</p>
<p>them all then it becomes a pain in the ass it becomes</p>
<p>like more of a pain in the ass of getting my friends</p>
<p>to get downstairs</p>
<p>in time so we can get to the fucking show and</p>
<p>you know did</p>
<p>you call this guy did you wake him up we got to</p>
<p>go to the fucking airport</p>
<p>where is he</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s five different guys and</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>their own bullshit</p>
<p>and then dude</p>
<p>started arguing with each other</p>
<p>and then it became ugly</p>
<p>then it became like okay this is nonsense so i had</p>
<p>to cut it most of it it was like a reality show for a</p>
<p>while it was it was too much though</p>
<p>it was too much like that</p>
<p>there was too many people</p>
<p>you know when it was</p>
<p>tate and eddie</p>
<p>and me and you and</p>
<p>larry and mike</p>
<p>young and all</p>
<p>these other dudes we&rsquo;d all go out</p>
<p>i mean come on that was ridiculous</p>
<p>it was a giant</p>
<p>group on the road man</p>
<p>yeah do you like touring with a</p>
<p>bunch of dudes</p>
<p>you always tour with your friends i kind of</p>
<p>i pretty much have</p>
<p>stuck close with the same guys that i</p>
<p>started like my</p>
<p>graduating class</p>
<p>bobby kelly</p>
<p>al del benny</p>
<p>you know i knew burr</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>started in patrice</p>
<p>because we kind of came up like a little bit after</p>
<p>you like you were a couple of years ahead</p>
<p>headlining around</p>
<p>and i did a</p>
<p>bunch of really</p>
<p>fun little gigs for dick doherty</p>
<p>the comedy huts remember</p>
<p>those comedy</p>
<p>huts yeah the</p>
<p>light ships</p>
<p>cambridge that we did</p>
<p>victor&rsquo;s comedy home</p>
<p>at the akuac</p>
<p>dane was with a comedy</p>
<p>troupe with bob</p>
<p>kelly and him and al del beni</p>
<p>so it was a good comedy</p>
<p>troupe you guys were funny</p>
<p>it was good you know it was interesting</p>
<p>you would do</p>
<p>comedy sketches and then you</p>
<p>would do like</p>
<p>each guy would go up and do stand up</p>
<p>right and so we</p>
<p>would work together do</p>
<p>these dick doherty gigs</p>
<p>those were fucking fun</p>
<p>our sketch comedy improv</p>
<p>group was so bad we were so bad at improv</p>
<p>and everybody you know the</p>
<p>first rule of improv</p>
<p>is don&rsquo;t deny</p>
<p>but we were so bad at improv that our</p>
<p>first rules</p>
<p>was denied so we</p>
<p>would just come in and</p>
<p>completely ruin</p>
<p>scenes by like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretending pantomiming i&rsquo;m holding a baby and</p>
<p>bobby can be like dude why are you holding a tire</p>
<p>and you just</p>
<p>it would just fall</p>
<p>apart from there but we just had a</p>
<p>you guys had</p>
<p>some good ones you had some good sketches with</p>
<p>a couple good</p>
<p>it was fun i mean it was and it was</p>
<p>experimental</p>
<p>it was like you guys were taking chances you</p>
<p>were doing something a little unusual at a comedy club</p>
<p>and you were doing comedy too</p>
<p>yeah that was probably</p>
<p>actually better for us opening with our</p>
<p>stand up and then we just go fuck around and do</p>
<p>music or skits or improv</p>
<p>or whatever for</p>
<p>whatever the rest of the hour to fill it up</p>
<p>do you still ever try to do improv</p>
<p>once in a while</p>
<p>or do you just only</p>
<p>stand up now</p>
<p>um a little bit i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>bringing out</p>
<p>cause al&rsquo;s been hosting down at the la factory and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>bring al up</p>

<p>stuff at the very end just</p>
<p>you know whatever skit</p>
<p>or dama rare and i will do some</p>
<p>stuff once in a</p>
<p>while where i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>bring don up and</p>
<p>bat some stuff around but not like i used to not like</p>
<p>sketch full on</p>
<p>sketch upright</p>
<p>citizens brigade yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not a sketch guy</p>
<p>i i really rather</p>
<p>prefer watching</p>
<p>stand up i mean sketches are fun and</p>
<p>everything like that you&rsquo;d be so</p>
<p>good at it though like</p>
<p>just like short</p>
<p>as much remember that</p>
<p>movie you did that little</p>
<p>short movie you did for</p>
<p>kelly kirsten</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about the</p>
<p>cable bill and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a five</p>
<p>minute clip or something like that i just pretended</p>
<p>to be my dad it was really easy</p>
<p>well how did it go from</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always wanted to know because you were in boston</p>
<p>and you were the</p>
<p>first guy who we</p>
<p>watched go from</p>
<p>headlining to</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re on tv</p>
<p>man and it was like everybody was looking at you going</p>
<p>how do i do that</p>
<p>how did you turn the corner how did you</p>
<p>get news radio</p>
<p>total luck complete</p>
<p>total luck i did</p>
<p>mtv&rsquo;s half hour comedy hour</p>
<p>and mtv was that</p>
<p>mario joiner or somebody else</p>
<p>yes and mario</p>
<p>would it was like i didn&rsquo;t even get to</p>
<p>shake his hand</p>
<p>like he introduces</p>
<p>you and he goes to the left and you go to the</p>
<p>right i was like damn i didn&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>shake mario join</p>
<p>his hand i felt like i wasn&rsquo;t even really on a show</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>mario joiner back then was the shit man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>where i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what happened there i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand well</p>
<p>he was the shit vanished anthony</p>
<p>clark was the host of like kamikaze</p>
<p>or something like</p>
<p>those guys were shit</p>
<p>but i know anthony so i know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>troubled so i know that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>would would lead him</p>
<p>to this weird</p>
<p>place he is now but i</p>
<p>never understood the</p>
<p>mario joiner</p>
<p>thing right</p>
<p>do you remember reggie mcfadden</p>
<p>i do remember there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>one right yeah</p>
<p>reggie mcfadden</p>
<p>was a monster</p>
<p>absolutely kill</p>
<p>one of the few guys that i really would</p>
<p>would be afraid to go on</p>
<p>i used to see him in the</p>
<p>early nineties in new york and i</p>
<p>would watch him to</p>
<p>stand up and i</p>
<p>would go fuck this guy&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>eddie murphy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be gigantic</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be the biggest comic ever</p>
<p>and then nothing</p>
<p>it was weird is</p>
<p>the weirdest</p>
<p>thing ever is he still even</p>
<p>exactly exactly that question</p>
<p>right there that&rsquo;s hilarious and charismatic guy</p>
<p>so just like handsome and well</p>
<p>spoken and a fucking really nice guy</p>
<p>like a real</p>
<p>nice guy whenever you&rsquo;re around him he&rsquo;s always smiling</p>
<p>having a good time</p>
<p>just like what the fuck happened how does this not work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very strange</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s a very strange thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very strange</p>
<p>thing when guys get angry</p>
<p>that for some reason or another they don&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>respect that they deserve that is one of my pet peeves</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing when people do that</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s because i mean i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak for reggie but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you go through this</p>
<p>phase or period and stand up</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like okay i&rsquo;ve committed my life to this</p>
<p>this is what i want to do</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m all in here at the</p>
<p>table i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>my for me my mid 20s there&rsquo;s no turning back now</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of those years</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching people go on</p>
<p>you know some people are getting</p>
<p>stuff some people are falling off</p>
<p>and it freaks you the hell out</p>
<p>man freaks you out</p>
<p>freaks you out hard</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very healthy attitude at all to look at someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>success as if somehow or another it&rsquo;s bad for you</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s not paying attention to you</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of dudes that are like you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel like my act gets the respect that it deserves</p>
<p>it gets the</p>
<p>exact respect it deserves</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no other way around it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the perfect</p>
<p>connection between you and an audience</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s not getting a reaction</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of one of two</p>
<p>things either you&rsquo;ve been very shitty in</p>
<p>marketing yourself</p>
<p>or promoting yourself or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not seeing it the way</p>
<p>other people are seeing it</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>found your audience</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people that have</p>
<p>weird acts like</p>
<p>you know mitch hedberg</p>
<p>for the longest time had a really hard time on the road</p>
<p>because he would go on and they</p>
<p>would put on these like</p>
<p>super high energy middle acts that would sing</p>
<p>and like i remember there was this</p>
<p>black dude in</p>
<p>i believe it was in ohio i</p>
<p>think it was at the</p>
<p>the funny bone in columbus</p>
<p>and hedberg was supposed to headline</p>
<p>and this guy was fucking</p>
<p>crushing it</p>
<p>every night in the</p>
<p>middle spot with singing and dancing and getting those</p>
<p>columbus ohio people into it and then hedberg</p>
<p>would just you know your</p>
<p>folks he&rsquo;s from there</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your peeps</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>people that&rsquo;s why i recorded my special there</p>
<p>but he would he</p>
<p>would go out to them and they</p>
<p>would hate him</p>
<p>they would hate him well was</p>
<p>he in that face to remember you just go up and kind of</p>
<p>he would stand there and</p>
<p>i remember for a</p>
<p>while and his hair were just</p>
<p>completely be</p>
<p>covering his face yeah</p>
<p>like not even looking up the</p>
<p>glasses nothing he was just like the top of his head</p>
<p>how do you go up</p>
<p>after somebody is fucking doing</p>
<p>juggling fucking chainsaws</p>
<p>which is hilarious by the way</p>
<p>and then yeah</p>
<p>it is a weird</p>
<p>thing right he had to find his audience</p>
<p>and he had a real hard time with that for a long time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always a tricky</p>
<p>thing man when you&rsquo;re coming</p>
<p>up in the beginning like there&rsquo;s guys who will tailor</p>
<p>their material or tailor their act</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t want to do this but they do it</p>
<p>just so that they can get more people liking them</p>
<p>and they can get like on a better</p>
<p>track right you know i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about yeah yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hard to fucking</p>
<p>especially when you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have an audience to really find your own voice</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s so tricky</p>
<p>because you know you</p>
<p>work at a club and if you offend someone i feel like</p>
<p>you know my act was always kind of</p>
<p>dirty and offensive</p>
<p>and like you know when i was nobody like they</p>
<p>would get upset at me like</p>
<p>you just there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three people that want</p>
<p>their money back</p>
<p>fucking asshole you know</p>
<p>clean up your act for the next show and you&rsquo;re like wow</p>
<p>yeah cleaning</p>
<p>my ass like this is what i like to do this is the</p>
<p>stuff that i always like to see like i can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about what i</p>
<p>think is actually funny</p>
<p>so when you were doing your</p>
<p>stand up and</p>
<p>you did finally</p>
<p>leave boston and hit the road</p>
<p>where did the news</p>
<p>radio thing finally even come from</p>
<p>so i did this</p>
<p>mtv thing and i got a development deal</p>
<p>right out of it with</p>
<p>fox to do a show called</p>
<p>hardball it was terrible show it was really bad but</p>
<p>a bunch of good guys on it</p>
<p>and i had fun but it was like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna be around</p>
<p>actors anymore i&rsquo;m like this is just too</p>
<p>gross i would go back to new york go back to comedy</p>
<p>but i fucked up and already got an apartment</p>
<p>cause i thought the show was</p>
<p>gonna everybody</p>
<p>thinks their show&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go sure so the ratings are good</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re picked up for next year</p>
<p>you know everybody</p>
<p>thinks that and so is</p>
<p>so my stupid ass got this fucking cool ass apartment</p>
<p>and i was like all</p>
<p>right now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>stuck so then</p>
<p>right after that i got a deal with nbc</p>
<p>before i know when i was on newsradio it was just like</p>
<p>stumbled into one</p>
<p>thing i mean i auditioned for newsradio but</p>
<p>it was kind of</p>
<p>funny because</p>
<p>one of the reasons</p>
<p>why they liked me for the part was that</p>
<p>there was no jokes</p>
<p>in the script</p>
<p>right like the</p>
<p>first one that gave out there</p>
<p>was no it was no</p>
<p>comedy in it it was just like really straight and flat</p>
<p>and i was like wow</p>

<p>very shitty with writing new material</p>
<p>and i wasn&rsquo;t performing that much</p>
<p>i was just loving the fact that i was making all this</p>
<p>money right</p>

<p>stupid shit and just no discipline</p>
<p>at all and saving up for your</p>
<p>first incredible car</p>

<p>as soon as i had</p>
<p>money i bought</p>

<p>those two dude</p>

<p>crazy wing in the back of your</p>
<p>spaceship i loved</p>

<p>first really cool car i</p>
<p>think i went</p>
<p>eighty five mustang gt with the</p>
<p>t tops did you charcoal gray</p>
<p>she was a beaut nice nice</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s something fucking cool</p>
<p>about buying your</p>
<p>first cool shit</p>
<p>i bought a pool cue for</p>
<p>seven thousand dollars</p>
<p>but this ernie</p>
<p>ernie gutera is this guy in la</p>
<p>makes this cue called a gina q</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>homemade like</p>
<p>really like precise perfectly balanced pool cue yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>things awesome seven k</p>
<p>do you collect</p>
<p>anything do you have anything that you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>spend money on you get the bet</p>
<p>i know we both get</p>
<p>steve martin john we both collect</p>
<p>steve martin</p>
<p>i got like a</p>
<p>bunch of memorabilia</p>
<p>yeah yeah i went back and</p>
<p>found a whole</p>
<p>bunch of old</p>
<p>vinyls lenny</p>
<p>bruce and cosby</p>
<p>and new heart and</p>
<p>steve martin and</p>
<p>stuff so that was kind of my</p>
<p>thing like i like finding</p>
<p>stuff that that&rsquo;s you know off the beaten path</p>
<p>as opposed to like alright anybody can go</p>
<p>i think for me the craziest car i did in aston martin</p>
<p>oh yeah and i thought okay i</p>
<p>spent a quarter of a million dollars on this car</p>
<p>this is gonna be the fucking craziest</p>
<p>car the best car ever</p>
<p>and it really</p>
<p>ended up being the</p>
<p>worst thing that i&rsquo;d ever bought with my</p>
<p>money dude i had the</p>
<p>exact same story with</p>
<p>a porsche 911 turbo</p>
<p>bought a 911</p>
<p>turbo and it</p>
<p>broke down on me</p>
<p>literally broke down</p>
<p>where it needed a tow</p>
<p>truck five times in</p>
<p>three years i</p>
<p>think i drove you</p>
<p>three times to the dealer just me yeah</p>
<p>yeah i spent</p>
<p>i was there like nine different</p>
<p>i love that we were complaining about</p>
<p>the fucking crap the crap it just</p>
<p>goes i have a</p>
<p>lexus it never fucks up</p>
<p>never never fuck they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bulletproof yeah yeah they make them so well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never any problems</p>
<p>but if you have</p>
<p>a mercedes or a porsche or something like that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have some weird</p>
<p>light goes off like what the fuck is this</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>why is my headlights not coming on shit</p>
<p>you gotta bring it in oh it&rsquo;s the computer</p>
<p>i wanted windows 95 on</p>
<p>those things i bought the aston martin</p>
<p>and then i bought</p>
<p>the casino royale</p>
<p>soundtrack and i just fucking</p>
<p>drove around</p>
<p>and i pretended i was a spy</p>
<p>and i literally was</p>
<p>pointing at</p>
<p>people on the side of the road pretending i was</p>
<p>shooting them and like</p>
<p>too much time on your hands</p>
<p>the problem with</p>
<p>those cars is when they work they&rsquo;re intoxicating</p>
<p>you know when you hear the</p>
<p>sound the ends of the</p>
<p>that fucking</p>
<p>powerful like well engineered engine but but</p>
<p>but it was such a poorly crafted car inside</p>
<p>that i was like why don&rsquo;t i just get a fucking ringtone</p>
<p>of that sound and be</p>
<p>happy with the fucking sound of the engine</p>
<p>and get rid of this plastic piece of shit as</p>
<p>everything inside with crap it&rsquo;s in an english car</p>
<p>right yeah they&rsquo;ve never been known for</p>
<p>really making great cars i mean</p>
<p>jaguar i guess yeah but the engine you&rsquo;re right it was</p>
<p>worth that to fuck up to before ford bottom</p>
<p>right yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah english you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>that you want japanese they don&rsquo;t fuck around but my</p>
<p>problem is is like</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s made by</p>
<p>robots now for the most part so even american</p>
<p>cars are made by the same</p>
<p>robots not the</p>
<p>same though it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>standards that</p>
<p>you engineer the car to that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using much higher standards</p>
<p>than american car companies are there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>about it i have a ford mustang</p>
<p>and i have a bmw m3</p>
<p>and the difference between them is so different</p>
<p>and ford is high</p>
<p>level as far as american cars go it&rsquo;s better than gm</p>
<p>but still you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>inside of it it just feels fucking chintzy</p>
<p>and things feel goofy and</p>
<p>the navigation</p>
<p>system kind of sucks</p>
<p>it was like it was engineered by an american guy you</p>
<p>know just kind of cocky</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the lexus like</p>
<p>everything that nav is</p>
<p>the best right yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>fucking dudes</p>
<p>money complaining</p>
<p>about cars how sad</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also had some</p>
<p>of all time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had we&rsquo;ve had nothing as well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing is you can actually</p>
<p>you could sit here and you</p>
<p>could tell these stories if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been fortunate enough to have some</p>
<p>success because</p>
<p>anybody who knows who&rsquo;s done this for a living</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking bad</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s empty it is at its</p>
<p>emptiest man so you</p>
<p>know you get a</p>
<p>little something or you have a few years of fun that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s kind of cool to be able it</p>
<p>still doesn&rsquo;t seem real to me</p>
<p>you know success and</p>
<p>money none of it seems real to me</p>
<p>you know when i can go to the</p>
<p>store and just buy things</p>
<p>oh look that tv looks like it</p>
<p>would be perfect</p>
<p>right there let&rsquo;s just get this thing in</p>
<p>and give me</p>
<p>a piece of plastic</p>
<p>and you give me whatever you got</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s ridiculous and it&rsquo;s unreal</p>
<p>yeah yeah it is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy she&rsquo;s fake</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it seem i mean</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you ever</p>
<p>walk around your house</p>
<p>i know you don&rsquo;t smoke pot</p>
<p>but when i do</p>
<p>i walk around my</p>
<p>house high and i&rsquo;ll just look at the</p>
<p>house and just go what the fuck is this</p>
<p>this is my house this is</p>
<p>where i live</p>
<p>this is so strange</p>
<p>you think about what it was like when you first</p>
<p>started making</p>
<p>money and you didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about bills anymore you know that feeling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the fucking most</p>
<p>liberating feeling ever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the big feeling it&rsquo;s not being</p>
<p>famous not being rich</p>
<p>the liberating feeling is not have to worry</p>
<p>about paying your bills that&rsquo;s the most important one</p>
<p>it was like wow</p>
<p>it was like all of a sudden it just like</p>
<p>lifted like i literally</p>
<p>physically felt</p>
<p>lighter i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget</p>
<p>it because i was always scratching it was always like</p>
<p>do this john schuler gig and</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;ll have enough</p>
<p>money for rent and then</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t eat tonight because i you know i</p>
<p>literally don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>money i have</p>
<p>to wait until tomorrow and my</p>
<p>check clears</p>
<p>billy down still owes you</p>
<p>sorry barry box</p>
<p>barry cats was the big one was</p>
<p>barry still your</p>
<p>manager yeah</p>
<p>yeah and he</p>
<p>still owes me 300</p>
<p>bucks from one of</p>
<p>those those</p>
<p>gigs that was brutal</p>
<p>for people that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about there was a time</p>
<p>where there was another entity that he had</p>
<p>called new york</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>right and they were booking colleges and apparently</p>
<p>it was costing too much</p>
<p>money to rent the</p>
<p>building where they were at</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>spending more</p>
<p>money than they were making</p>
<p>so they started</p>
<p>spending the comedians</p>
<p>money and owing it to them</p>
<p>literally like</p>
<p>you would go to the gig you</p>
<p>would fly around the country go to</p>
<p>these colleges</p>
<p>get your checks</p>
<p>send them into barry</p>
<p>and then you know you would wait</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d be like a</p>
<p>month later be like what the fuck dude</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my money this is getting</p>
<p>crazy and then it</p>
<p>would be like another time you</p>
<p>would do it like</p>
<p>three or four times it was guys it had like</p>
<p>they had a lot of</p>
<p>money out yeah i don&rsquo;t know how it all got settled</p>
<p>but it was ugly</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you still got</p>
<p>salty about</p>
<p>do it around</p>
<p>barrow be like you want that</p>
<p>three hundred and i&rsquo;m like no it&rsquo;s like good luck</p>
<p>charm is you not paying</p>
<p>me bust my ass</p>
<p>i have the i&rsquo;ll show him fucking theory</p>
<p>going yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah but i know for me man like seriously it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what put things in perspective and</p>
<p>some people know this or don&rsquo;t is like</p>
<p>i hired my step brother</p>
<p>my half brother</p>
<p>i know that</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s a crazy</p>
<p>story it was like alright so i thought i had this</p>
<p>great nest egg i bought a</p>
<p>house i did all that and then he came in and</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t talk too much</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s ongoing but</p>
<p>let me talk</p>
<p>about it since you can&rsquo;t so the</p>
<p>rumor is you don&rsquo;t have to say anything</p>
<p>that he stole like 11 million dollars from you yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking horrifying five years you</p>
<p>think that your fucking brother</p>
<p>your blood like someone you grow up with is</p>
<p>so fucking jealous and so</p>
<p>shifty and plotting</p>
<p>against you</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>steal your fucking money</p>
<p>allegedly allegedly</p>
<p>such a betrayal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it man</p>
<p>it really i mean</p>
<p>first of all absolute</p>
<p>complete betrayal</p>
<p>and the way i deal with that with my family</p>
<p>but the thing that</p>
<p>really was jarring in the best of possible ways was</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>stand up for</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>stand up for 20 years</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>everything happened i</p>
<p>started in 1990</p>
<p>and then i looked and i was like all</p>
<p>right this is gone i</p>
<p>never had this</p>
<p>either it was gone or whatever</p>
<p>i went back on tour i did</p>
<p>probably the biggest</p>
<p>tour that i&rsquo;ll ever do last year i did 80 arenas</p>
<p>i went out there i fucking just you know was hammering</p>
<p>yeah the economy was shitty but i kept</p>
<p>going i was</p>
<p>promoting my fans came out</p>
<p>and it was that</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t had a moment in a lot of years where</p>
<p>really struggling</p>
<p>again where you&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>trouble if i don&rsquo;t do something</p>
<p>and the ride is over what do i have left</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>for me years down the line and i was really you know</p>
<p>thankful that</p>
<p>the fans came out and supported but</p>
<p>it was that moment where i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going okay you</p>
<p>know yeah i bought some cool shit in my life and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve collected some</p>
<p>album missouri you know buy something</p>
<p>crazy once in a while but</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fucking take somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creativity it always comes back you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>stuff you lose i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve lost it</p>
<p>many times in my life</p>
<p>and all you can do is keep getting back on</p>
<p>stage or fucking getting out there and</p>
<p>doing whatever you know connects you to something yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what it is really for</p>
<p>comics too it&rsquo;s putting the new</p>
<p>thing together</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s putting that new</p>
<p>chunk and then</p>
<p>the new set and you know</p>
<p>preparing for the next special</p>
<p>and feeling</p>
<p>these new bits come</p>
<p>alive and the tags and the new tags it&rsquo;s like what a</p>
<p>burst you get</p>
<p>every time you come up with a new tag</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this positive energy charge like ah yeah</p>
<p>look and then sometimes on</p>
<p>stage in the moment</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll pause</p>
<p>and say the perfect shit out of nowhere and it destroys</p>
<p>and that becomes the closer i mean that</p>
<p>becomes the part of the bit that ends the bit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best feeling on</p>
<p>earth man really when it all</p>
<p>starts to come together you see that you know you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like you have a theme or a through line that</p>
<p>starts to come through and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing better in the</p>
<p>world man in</p>
<p>right from the bat</p>
<p>right from the get go when you have your</p>
<p>first good set you become a junkie for that feeling</p>
<p>you become someone who needs to kill</p>
<p>you need to get up there and kill</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do any new you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna fuck around</p>
<p>and do any new shit that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>in the beginning because you&rsquo;re scared yeah and you</p>
<p>wanna make sure you get</p>
<p>through the set good</p>
<p>and you just just do the</p>
<p>stuff that you know is</p>
<p>gonna work don&rsquo;t fuck around don&rsquo;t fuck around</p>
<p>right it hampers your growth</p>
<p>because you become this fucking junkie</p>
<p>you just want that charge just</p>
<p>wanna hear them scream</p>
<p>you wanna hear oh shit oh no he didn&rsquo;t i know</p>
<p>but we we also</p>
<p>you know we came out of boston where</p>
<p>you know i know</p>
<p>the guys that i can i mean i love i love</p>
<p>steve martin and the guys that i always loved just</p>
<p>watching growing up</p>
<p>that i wanted to emulate and then when i</p>
<p>started in boston</p>
<p>these guys were like</p>
<p>killers man what people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand about boston is everybody knows all</p>
<p>these famous guys everybody knows</p>
<p>billy crystal everybody knows</p>
<p>you know i mean in the very good</p>
<p>comics robert</p>
<p>klein blah blah</p>
<p>blah name the guy</p>
<p>don gavin was better than all of them</p>
<p>he was better than all of them</p>
<p>this is not an exaggeration</p>
<p>and he was fucking</p>
<p>squeaky clean</p>
<p>i mean every now and</p>
<p>then he said fucking fuck fuck a little less than that</p>
<p>but his bits were not dirty</p>
<p>it was delivery was</p>
<p>perfect right</p>
<p>it was perfect</p>
<p>you would watch his economy of words the way he</p>
<p>set a sentence up</p>
<p>and you would just feel humbled you</p>
<p>would be like fuck he&rsquo;s a master yeah he&rsquo;s a master but</p>
<p>he got caught up in this boston thing</p>
<p>where there was all these</p>
<p>great guys in this one area and they always drew a</p>
<p>crowd and they always got paid well</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would go on the road and they&rsquo;d be nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like why would i be a fucking nobody</p>
<p>back in boston</p>
<p>next thing you know they&rsquo;re back in boston</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just doing the same gigs over and over</p>
<p>again when everybody else</p>
<p>takes a shot</p>
<p>and branches off and disappears and becomes famous</p>
<p>and but you really</p>
<p>would watch</p>
<p>these guys and part of you</p>
<p>would feel bad that they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>getting over the hump but</p>
<p>you felt like so fucking</p>
<p>honored to be opening up</p>
<p>and standing</p>
<p>watching going i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>learning from the best</p>
<p>so when you</p>
<p>leave boston</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you had that</p>
<p>these were guys like i always describe it like</p>
<p>they had the</p>
<p>energy of showman but they were like men they were like</p>
<p>men doing comedy</p>
<p>yes yes and</p>
<p>you know i always really wanted to be there they always</p>
<p>stood right at the fucking</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>stage or really lenny</p>
<p>clark is the perfect example</p>
<p>of that when</p>
<p>lenny&rsquo;s a fucking man he&rsquo;s a guy this is what</p>
<p>lenny clark said was</p>
<p>we were at giggles in saugus and there was this fucking</p>
<p>table full of</p>
<p>chicks they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t shut the fuck up</p>
<p>they were screaming and yelling and goes</p>
<p>listen if you don&rsquo;t shut the fuck up i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna hire a</p>
<p>nigga to fuck you in</p>
<p>front of your mother</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what the fuck did he just say</p>
<p>mean it was me i</p>
<p>think chris maguire was there i</p>
<p>think it was me and chris i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember we were like what the fuck did he just say</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck yeah lenny</p>
<p>clark did not give a fuck he was just this big yeah</p>
<p>gigantic burly guy</p>
<p>who would by the way he</p>
<p>would beat your ass to</p>
<p>who this is</p>
<p>like if you like talk shit to</p>
<p>lenny clark</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll probably you know do a line and</p>
<p>punch you in the face yeah</p>
<p>these were real like real hardcore</p>
<p>blue collar guys but</p>
<p>fucking hilarious but</p>
<p>it made us it made us</p>
<p>sharper because you were held up to a much higher</p>
<p>standard you had to go on</p>
<p>after guys who were way better than average</p>
<p>and you had to be</p>
<p>sharp all the time</p>
<p>you had to constantly reassess your material you did</p>
<p>i learned a lot</p>
<p>watching joe before us because the</p>
<p>thing that happened with you though was you were the</p>
<p>first guy that i saw from the next</p>
<p>young generation</p>
<p>that when you</p>
<p>started headlining</p>
<p>you were getting the respect for for killing</p>
<p>but you were the</p>
<p>first guy that</p>
<p>i saw that had real backlash ever in my life</p>
<p>that people were like they didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>where to put them</p>
<p>and people that he passed no not</p>
<p>gonna mention names but like</p>
<p>they were just so fucking frustrated</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with like okay wait a</p>
<p>minute this is the next guy coming up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>you know people are always</p>
<p>gonna resent</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>good looking and</p>
<p>every fucking chicken the</p>
<p>crowd after the show is just like</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fighting thing to</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense at all it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>supposed to they&rsquo;re not supposed to coincide together</p>
<p>yeah the martial arts thing</p>
<p>it just seems like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not the i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not in the club</p>
<p>you know and i mean that&rsquo;s what it felt like to me</p>

<p>expression of how people feel people are</p>
<p>frustrated and</p>
<p>angry and and look</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been shown that we live in a</p>
<p>place where we have a fake economy</p>

<p>still pretending that it&rsquo;s real we</p>
<p>print up money</p>
<p>nobody understands</p>

<p>while i&rsquo;ll still do like call of duty or something but</p>
<p>you want to play for 11</p>
<p>hours in a row when you</p>
<p>do that i get so addicted to online</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so addictive</p>
<p>when quake first person</p>
<p>shooters i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this many times i</p>
<p>used to play 10</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>no bullshit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we actually kind of really first met</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we met bob</p>
<p>before the big</p>
<p>big breakup but it was like</p>
<p>i remember you tell me</p>
<p>about alienware computers and all that shit</p>
<p>so i went out and got one i</p>
<p>basically got with the computer he told me he had</p>
<p>which i didn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>money for at</p>
<p>the time but just like i got this it&rsquo;s a rig and</p>
<p>area 51 fucking</p>
<p>i went and got it i was living in the shitty little</p>
<p>studio on hacienda</p>
<p>and all i had was</p>
<p>a fucking futon</p>
<p>and my alienware computer</p>
<p>it i don&rsquo;t really know anybody out here anyway when i</p>
<p>first came out</p>
<p>but i jump on with joe once while and</p>
<p>think like our quake</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>he would like just destroy</p>
<p>right he just like not even destroy it was not even</p>
<p>fun it was not even like</p>
<p>we talked about this</p>
<p>it was just bad it was like beyond rape</p>
<p>yeah he would</p>
<p>do the like kill me like 99 times in a row i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think i killed you once</p>
<p>maybe in like</p>
<p>three hour period now i&rsquo;m like joe</p>
<p>i need to stop</p>
<p>i need to stop</p>
<p>dude not only</p>
<p>would joe be plasma</p>
<p>rifling me up my ass</p>
<p>like every other hit</p>
<p>but then i&rsquo;d hear through his whatever the headset like</p>
<p>be doing something else</p>
<p>which made it even fucking</p>
<p>worse like i</p>
<p>could tell he was not even</p>
<p>completely focused</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>sweating and doing that</p>
<p>thing where i&rsquo;m like trying to</p>
<p>sound like i&rsquo;m not fucking raging i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>good shot joe</p>
<p>turn off the mic i&rsquo;m like fuck come on</p>
<p>quake is one of</p>
<p>those games for</p>
<p>those who don&rsquo;t know it it&rsquo;s a first person</p>
<p>shooter where you&rsquo;re running down these</p>
<p>3d mazes and you have all these different gun options</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of those games that relies</p>
<p>very heavily on playing it all the time</p>
<p>so the mouse and the keyboard</p>
<p>literally become like an extension of your mind</p>
<p>and you can get it to do what you want it to do</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re so comfortable with the movements</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wasd use the keys to move backward</p>
<p>and strafe side to side but you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about it you just do it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like i&rsquo;m going to the</p>
<p>right when i go to the</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m thinking to the</p>
<p>right and as i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking my fingers are moving</p>
<p>and you get totally synced up with it</p>
<p>you have to do it like 8 10 hours a day to do that</p>
<p>so i was obsessed</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d go online that&rsquo;s what i would do</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d be like having conversations with my chick</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d be thinking i</p>
<p>could be playing quick right now right</p>
<p>i tried to pretend that i wanted to see a</p>
<p>movie with her</p>
<p>i was a complete junkie what was</p>
<p>weird is that you were really competitive</p>
<p>with the game</p>
<p>where like i</p>
<p>would just hide in the toilet</p>
<p>paper roll of the unreal bathroom</p>
<p>map and just sit there and snipe people</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re more like kill</p>
<p>kill everyone number</p>
<p>seconds it&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>know my leftover martial arts days there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still some work to be done in the back of my head so</p>
<p>just running down hallways</p>
<p>shooting people this thing is so satisfying it&rsquo;s so fun</p>
<p>i remember it was over when i was at fry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>electronics trying to buy like shit that i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he had</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like is there a mouse that has</p>
<p>every button already on like what can i do to fucking</p>
<p>have one one advantage and guys never beat</p>
<p>me by the way guys do the same</p>
<p>thing that i did to you to me</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t that many guys but</p>
<p>every now and then you run into</p>
<p>like a chinese virgin some thirteen year old kid who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>every day fifteen</p>
<p>hours a day just</p>
<p>staring through his bifocals at that fucking screen</p>
<p>blasting dude oh man dudes</p>
<p>would rape me it</p>
<p>would happen all the time and i</p>
<p>would be like how</p>
<p>the fuck i thought it was good</p>
<p>guys would gun</p>
<p>you down and hit you with rail guns impossible shots</p>
<p>you just you showed up for a</p>
<p>second you&rsquo;re dead like</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>some guys are just</p>
<p>just on another level</p>
<p>and now kids have all the modded controllers</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>using a regular control so i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m never</p>
<p>going to have the advantage anymore they&rsquo;ve got like</p>
<p>these you know whatever wolfpack fucking</p>
<p>sticks and it&rsquo;s like nine</p>
<p>deal with the console</p>
<p>you know the console</p>
<p>is not as precise and they did a thing with</p>
<p>microsoft started</p>
<p>they did a competition between console guys against</p>
<p>keyboard guys</p>
<p>yeah but you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never play that you get used to the</p>
<p>point if everyone&rsquo;s doing the same</p>
<p>controller then everyone&rsquo;s on the same page you know</p>
<p>but the same controller isn&rsquo;t as precise why</p>
<p>would you use that person you can</p>
<p>get really good at it i mean you can&rsquo;t get as good</p>
<p>right for what you like to play your kind of</p>
<p>first death</p>
<p>destruction son</p>
<p>you just want to win</p>
<p>the most connection between you and what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>but you know how fun it is to get on your xbox and</p>
<p>go oh carlos monsea</p>
<p>is playing call</p>
<p>of duty let&rsquo;s kill him a little bit it&rsquo;s so fun</p>
<p>do you ever kill him</p>
<p>i played him once really yeah</p>
<p>is he any good no no</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>kick his ass</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i</p>
<p>think i was more just like</p>
<p>watching him talking around</p>
<p>see like i said i hang out in the toilet</p>
<p>does he play</p>
<p>lights does he</p>
<p>play like joe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a video game boyer</p>
<p>nice shot man</p>
<p>i went to his website</p>
<p>the other day for something because</p>
<p>every now and then i like to</p>
<p>read his twitter</p>
<p>and go what the fuck it&rsquo;s just so strange</p>
<p>so i went to his website and it said</p>
<p>one of the most feared comedians in the country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like on his bio on the</p>
<p>front of his yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the punisher one of the most feared</p>
<p>like what a</p>
<p>crazy thought you talk</p>
<p>about the wrong</p>
<p>psychology for comedy</p>
<p>one of the most feared you want to be a feared comedian</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>what does that even really mean that&rsquo;s so strange</p>
<p>do you collect comics</p>
<p>what the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about carl spencer</p>
<p>i know don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>changing gears like that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous wow</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about someone</p>
<p>completely crazy</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know what that means who wants to be a feared</p>
<p>comic that&rsquo;s horrible it&rsquo;s a horrible way of thinking</p>
<p>you want people to fear you who is</p>
<p>gonna fear you the audience</p>
<p>other comedians</p>
<p>well he what he likes to do and you know he talked</p>
<p>about on the mark baron</p>
<p>podcast i thought it was really fascinating</p>
<p>yeah i heard that to it</p>
<p>though when he</p>
<p>called back</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>cause he went</p>
<p>in and that was kind of you</p>
<p>know it was</p>
<p>weird marin was like it was very strange</p>
<p>very strange conversation but</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t understand why marin didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely insane</p>
<p>right carls is like</p>
<p>gone he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>bipolar or something like there&rsquo;s something wrong</p>
<p>but when he</p>
<p>started talking</p>
<p>about about the</p>
<p>during the podcast what was it exactly</p>
<p>shit now i&rsquo;m trying to remember</p>
<p>fuck</p>
<p>god damn it i can&rsquo;t remember what the</p>
<p>crazy part was</p>
<p>oh one of the</p>
<p>crazy ones was</p>
<p>did you tell me this one that he was saying that some</p>
<p>troops that someone was</p>
<p>thinking about killing themselves</p>
<p>would they read his shit and</p>
<p>or they saw him perform and</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t kill themselves that yeah no it wasn&rsquo;t me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m making shit up now now i&rsquo;m just giving them rumors</p>
<p>but he was talking about how he would go on</p>
<p>stage in front of guys on purpose</p>
<p>to make them feel bad</p>
<p>that he would yeah he would</p>
<p>do an hour and he talked</p>
<p>about how he did it to mark marin he talked</p>
<p>about how he did it to what&rsquo;s that dude&rsquo;s name um</p>
<p>steve trevino</p>
<p>first time steve trevino ever got the headline</p>
<p>carlos went on right before him and did like an hour</p>
<p>25 minutes yeah</p>
<p>crazy but when he was talking about</p>
<p>he comes like</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s pained that he did it that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s we that i don&rsquo;t associate</p>
<p>with it&rsquo;s fake i had to</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s what i had to do it&rsquo;s like why</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s broken i</p>
<p>was your like a</p>
<p>legit sociopath where</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel emotions way everybody else does</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t think he</p>
<p>feels when he&rsquo;s hurt either he&rsquo;s got like this</p>
<p>weird block</p>
<p>going on it&rsquo;s very strange</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about my brother now</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a lot of people there&rsquo;s a book written</p>
<p>recently called the</p>
<p>enemy amongst us or something like that something</p>
<p>along those lines</p>
<p>and it was all</p>
<p>about sociopaths</p>
<p>about how many people amongst us really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel emotions they just pretend they do to fit in</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t fear</p>
<p>the consequences of</p>
<p>their actions they don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about hurting</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s feelings</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>real problem there&rsquo;s a lot of people like that</p>
<p>yeah i think i&rsquo;m on the fucking complete</p>
<p>other side of that man i&rsquo;m one of</p>
<p>those people i feel like i feel everything</p>
<p>well to be a</p>
<p>comic you have to be fucked up</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>we would all</p>
<p>admit to that</p>
<p>you have to be sensitive you</p>
<p>have to be insecure</p>
<p>you have to be there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got to be something inside of you that wants attention</p>
<p>so badly that it&rsquo;s willing to go through</p>
<p>those early days</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re not fucked up you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find something better you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find something that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hurt so much</p>
<p>you know but that need to be special</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be so strong</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re willing to get through the bombing right</p>
<p>right i just</p>
<p>remember being so afraid in because i was like the</p>
<p>complete not only introverted</p>
<p>but i was like i had like anxiety i had social anxiety</p>
<p>i still really do actually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny because i can do</p>
<p>huge fucking arenas</p>
<p>if the meet and</p>
<p>greet&rsquo;s 10 people i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>all right what are we doing</p>
<p>but in high</p>
<p>school it was really bad</p>
<p>and i remember feeling like that</p>
<p>first time i got a</p>
<p>laugh that like</p>
<p>broke up a moment</p>
<p>and it was like oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the fucking weapon</p>
<p>right there totally</p>
<p>i want people to fear my comedy what what is that</p>
<p>my first one i did out of anger</p>
<p>i had this really shitty math</p>
<p>teacher it was always mean</p>
<p>and she would just</p>
<p>treat you like you were really dumb if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand things</p>
<p>and she was a</p>
<p>black lady and she was</p>
<p>doing this thing on</p>
<p>stage or on</p>
<p>stage she was doing this</p>
<p>thing in front of the</p>

<p>you want to be a comedian that&rsquo;s what you should do</p>
<p>first person to ever tell me you</p>
<p>should do that</p>
<p>yeah so nice</p>
<p>to have someone there to say something like that yeah i</p>
<p>never had anybody tell me that</p>
<p>everybody told me i sucked</p>
<p>my own mom told me she didn&rsquo;t think i</p>
<p>should go into comedy because i wasn&rsquo;t very funny</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more of a mom protecting herself oh it was for</p>
<p>sure but for sure but</p>
<p>god damn lady</p>
<p>my girlfriend</p>
<p>my girlfriend does that she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want me to do</p>
<p>comedy because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like she</p>
<p>watches her friend do it and it&rsquo;s embarrassing she</p>
<p>feels bad and she&rsquo;s like oh you don&rsquo;t want to she just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want you to eat it</p>
<p>yeah watching somebody eat is hard</p>
<p>my friend eddie</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about that i got</p>
<p>eddie to do</p>
<p>stand up nine times</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a funny guy he says like really</p>
<p>funny shit right</p>
<p>always and i&rsquo;m like dude you</p>
<p>could totally be a</p>
<p>comic i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>within two years of fucking around and practicing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be open up for me on the road i&rsquo;ll help you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll cut out a lot of the time the development time</p>
<p>like dude you</p>
<p>could be a comic</p>
<p>just listen to me i can help you</p>
<p>fuck yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this how i do this</p>
<p>and he just fucking</p>
<p>over and over the bombings were so disastrous</p>
<p>it was so hard to watch it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny how like people that we know that are funny</p>
<p>and when they try</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they land on</p>
<p>stage the furthest</p>
<p>place from what really actually makes them</p>
<p>funny and fucking interesting</p>
<p>yeah well they just don&rsquo;t know how to be perceived</p>
<p>they just get confused as to how they</p>
<p>should be perceived</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just they want to like</p>
<p>they wanna like</p>
<p>somehow know that like fit this mold of what they</p>
<p>think is gonna be</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the connection between them and the audience is so</p>
<p>distant and</p>
<p>fucked up and</p>
<p>jagged and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>barbed wire in the way</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s for most people they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that in</p>
<p>order to be able to be yourself</p>
<p>and get on stage and talk in</p>
<p>front of somebody</p>
<p>you have to like</p>
<p>really know what the fuck you</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re coming off you have to really know yourself</p>
<p>in a way that a lot of people aren&rsquo;t comfortable</p>
<p>looking at themselves yeah you</p>
<p>have to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about being</p>
<p>revealing and then finally not giving a fuck anymore</p>
<p>that people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like what they see</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>can slowly find the people that like what they see and</p>
<p>build the last from there man</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gotta</p>
<p>be a real not give a fuck it can&rsquo;t be i&rsquo;m pretending</p>
<p>to not give a fuck like you have to have mastered it to</p>
<p>enough where you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>understood the situation and you&rsquo;ve assessed it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been objective</p>
<p>about the whole</p>
<p>relationship between</p>
<p>you and the audience over and over</p>
<p>again so many times</p>
<p>that you completely master</p>
<p>that and then you&rsquo;re comfortable with the experience</p>
<p>and then only then can you go up</p>
<p>there and just be yourself and fuck around and be funny</p>
<p>but until you hit that vibe that one groove</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going up there</p>
<p>going clunky dude</p>
<p>like clunk clunk</p>
<p>you just please love me</p>
<p>you just like please what can i do to make a</p>
<p>connection with you and you get it like little bits oh</p>
<p>touch a little</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t grab you and hug you you know</p>
<p>the beginning days</p>
<p>every now and then you&rsquo;re like you would</p>
<p>crack like one bit that was like ooh it has</p>
<p>something there</p>
<p>and people would laugh</p>
<p>like i think there&rsquo;s something there yeah i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m touching</p>
<p>gold there&rsquo;s gold under here and we keep digging</p>
<p>fuck it&rsquo;s hard you listen to</p>
<p>yourself a lot like you record your sets and i really i</p>
<p>never used to</p>
<p>until you know you make cds and then you have to</p>
<p>which is brutal</p>
<p>and also i mean i remember</p>
<p>i listened to the</p>
<p>first cd and i went okay</p>
<p>at that point in my life</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>real drama in my life there was</p>
<p>nothing dramatic</p>
<p>about my life</p>
<p>it was pretty easy going</p>
<p>a lot of my</p>
<p>first stuff was</p>
<p>very nostalgic and very</p>
<p>we kind of like this is the</p>
<p>stuff i grew up with we it&rsquo;s fun that&rsquo;s what i knew</p>
<p>and as i listen to that</p>
<p>i was like alright two</p>
<p>things first of all when i listen to myself</p>
<p>like i would say</p>
<p>forty percent of it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no words it was just physicality</p>
<p>and that was when i started really getting passionate</p>
<p>about vernacular and wanting to build up</p>
<p>a language and paint better stories with words</p>
<p>and not only that but i started having</p>
<p>things happen in my life in my personal life with</p>
<p>especially my folks</p>
<p>that really were like are you know</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m not a kid anymore who just goes up and talks</p>
<p>about fucking or</p>
<p>you know frat you</p>
<p>know kind of humor</p>
<p>drinking it was like i have real issues real problems</p>
<p>but now how do i turn a corner and how can i</p>
<p>you know it takes a</p>
<p>while to be able to</p>
<p>not reinvent but</p>
<p>have a metamorphosis</p>
<p>on stage with</p>
<p>truth and like</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re at in your life do you feel that</p>
<p>all the criticism that you&rsquo;ve gotten and i can say this</p>
<p>for myself all the criticism that i&rsquo;ve gotten even the</p>
<p>stuff that hurts and even the</p>
<p>stuff that was</p>
<p>wrong and just hurtful</p>
<p>it helps me</p>
<p>absolutely it&rsquo;s improved me</p>
<p>even the douchebags</p>
<p>have improved me because it&rsquo;s made me</p>
<p>look at myself through</p>
<p>their eyes and go okay do they have a point</p>
<p>like what is it</p>
<p>about me that&rsquo;s offensive to them what is it</p>
<p>about me that they don&rsquo;t like yeah you know</p>
<p>and then you see it and you go oh okay i can see how</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;m being kind of douchey</p>
<p>or like i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had bits for my old cds</p>
<p>where i would like to go back and</p>
<p>change and i was like i don&rsquo;t even want that being</p>
<p>a representative of my</p>
<p>thinking i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look like that anymore old specials that air and</p>
<p>people just discover you and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh is that what you do yeah</p>
<p>i go to england</p>
<p>a lot and i love it over there but i had an old</p>
<p>bid about just shitting on england</p>
<p>how fucking</p>
<p>stupid it was</p>
<p>right now the</p>
<p>women are disgusting</p>
<p>and it was just a mean bit for no reason</p>
<p>i just met a couple english people and like i just</p>
<p>wrote this crazy bit</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what i say like i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think that way anymore this is just douchey shit</p>
<p>i definitely look back</p>
<p>no regrets because</p>
<p>everything builds you up to</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re at but</p>
<p>for me when it was like okay i finally hit i</p>
<p>crossed over</p>
<p>and i remember i had a moment</p>
<p>where i was like okay</p>
<p>when all the djs in the country were really talking</p>
<p>about me that&rsquo;s when i knew i was in trouble</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i really batten</p>
<p>down the hatches and i was like alright i know what</p>
<p>two years from now i know the way this is</p>
<p>gonna go and i know the way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come back and you know what</p>
<p>i just took it</p>
<p>i took it all on the chin</p>
<p>i pretty much fucking just</p>
<p>kept showing up</p>
<p>doing my thing because</p>
<p>when the pendulum</p>
<p>swings into the good area</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going the same fucking direction in the</p>
<p>other area man it&rsquo;s really so there&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>backlash for somebody who works hard to get attention</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing about people</p>
<p>when you work</p>
<p>hard to get attention if you get attention</p>
<p>and people like</p>
<p>people love dave chappelle</p>
<p>one of the things i love</p>
<p>about dave chappelle is he&rsquo;s very reclusive</p>
<p>he goes on stage like</p>
<p>weird he&rsquo;ll show up in a park with a fucking pa</p>
<p>system and do a show</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>but when people promote a lot</p>
<p>and people get</p>
<p>their name out there a lot</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a backlash for that always</p>
<p>why is that i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>man what the</p>
<p>fuck is that i got that why me i did that because</p>
<p>i in nineteen ninety</p>
<p>eight i was sitting around</p>
<p>doing nothing for most of the day</p>
<p>except waiting for sets i just come out here</p>
<p>and i was watching a documentary on fucking punk bands</p>
<p>and they were showing them put up like</p>
<p>hey we&rsquo;re dragon face and</p>
<p>literally nailing</p>
<p>their flyers to telephone poles</p>
<p>and i remember sitting there</p>
<p>going like this is what i need to do whatever the</p>
<p>modern version of that is i need to fucking build</p>
<p>a fan base i need to like some kind of</p>
<p>grassroots thing cause i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t want this to pass me by and</p>
<p>and then what</p>
<p>do i have nothing i&rsquo;m good at nothing else</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really shitty</p>
<p>at a lot of</p>
<p>things in this world</p>
<p>really bad i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the only way you ever make it as a</p>
<p>comic if i had</p>
<p>other career paths</p>
<p>my other career path was</p>
<p>brain damage my</p>
<p>other career path was kickboxing</p>
<p>what am i gonna do i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get brain damage</p>
<p>for no money</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m gonna become a</p>
<p>comic well i don&rsquo;t have any other</p>
<p>skills i don&rsquo;t have a college degree what the fuck am i</p>
<p>gonna do i can&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a shitty worker</p>
<p>i would show up at construction gigs i&rsquo;d last two weeks</p>
<p>pocket the money and then</p>
<p>fucking quit like fuck this i</p>
<p>would like tar</p>
<p>roofs and it was like half a day and i&rsquo;m out yeah</p>
<p>yeah boston man</p>
<p>those people fucking work hard</p>
<p>and you know that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an east coast</p>
<p>worth ethic</p>
<p>because of the fact that it snows there</p>
<p>and it gets</p>
<p>deathly cold in the winter</p>
<p>people are hard</p>
<p>they fucking work man they get up</p>
<p>at seven in the morning and they&rsquo;re at work by</p>
<p>eight and they fucking work all day in the snow</p>
<p>in the sun 90 fucking degrees out hammering</p>
<p>nails that&rsquo;s a hard gig bro</p>
<p>doing construction in boston</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re doing that but when you know</p>
<p>those people are coming to your shows</p>
<p>probably why the guys before us it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>better give them a fucking show fuck yeah you better</p>

<p>their own connection to it</p>

<p>the whole this is all you see on your desk i see</p>
<p>great i see is green text and</p>
<p>black screen you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t access your your task bar that&rsquo;s smart</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do anything the only</p>
<p>thing you do is you know you</p>
<p>could quit and you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart man and that keeps you</p>
<p>focused totally focused and i shut my phones off</p>
<p>cause i write and i end up seeing shit pop up yeah</p>
<p>ah yeah or you</p>

<p>maybe i should just beat off and then you just go</p>
<p>start checking out porn sites and</p>
<p>spanking one off</p>
<p>yeah i hear you&rsquo;re writing a book right now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying yeah</p>
<p>that shit&rsquo;s hard man that&rsquo;s one of the hardest</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve ever fucking</p>
<p>taken on i&rsquo;m writing one</p>
<p>right now and i won&rsquo;t let anybody help me</p>
<p>you know people came were like</p>
<p>you can hire this guy and no one will ever know and</p>
<p>and so and so used them and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>first of all that&rsquo;s pathetic</p>
<p>and secondly fuck i</p>
<p>this i want this to be the hardest</p>
<p>thing that i ever accomplished</p>
<p>yeah i want to make sure that everyone knows</p>
<p>that every word is in a certain order</p>
<p>because i wrote it</p>
<p>it is it&rsquo;s all of it</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>representation that i can come up with of my thoughts</p>
<p>yeah you know you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>great writer i mean i&rsquo;ve read some of your</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need any help in that department well</p>
<p>thank you but i</p>
<p>think everybody does</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>you use in the beginning</p>
<p>especially you could use</p>
<p>someone else&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p>you know someone else</p>
<p>who sees what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing and has a different opinion on</p>
<p>things i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very beneficial yeah i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve given my</p>
<p>stuff you know to</p>
<p>friends or you</p>
<p>know people that i</p>
<p>trust to read it</p>
<p>after the fact but so in that</p>
<p>sense they help</p>
<p>i mean you get feedback</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>definitely a better writer now because of all the</p>
<p>feedback that i&rsquo;ve gotten from people over the years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the same</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like comedy in a way</p>
<p>but the thing is you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>your connection with</p>
<p>the writing</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a hard</p>
<p>thing to describe</p>
<p>but sometimes the words come to you when you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage you&rsquo;re performing and you know you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get in the groove and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>bits will come to you at a thin air</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something even crazier</p>
<p>about it when you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<p>cause when you&rsquo;re writing sometimes i&rsquo;ll get through a</p>
<p>whole paragraph</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ll go back and read i go god damn</p>
<p>where the fuck did that even come</p>
<p>from yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it just came out of</p>
<p>space it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in this weird</p>
<p>semi conscious</p>
<p>state when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>writing we&rsquo;re just like so zoned into what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;re zoned in</p>
<p>sentences just sort of form themselves in your head</p>
<p>and then they change</p>
<p>their position</p>
<p>and no this isn&rsquo;t the beginning and you read it</p>
<p>again and it offers you another perspective</p>
<p>it just all</p>
<p>starts it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like literally like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuning into something that comes out of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the air somewhere it</p>
<p>truly is like the most incredible form of therapy</p>
<p>that i could i mean</p>
<p>after my folks passed away</p>
<p>and people were like you</p>
<p>should go talk to somebody and like i was</p>
<p>bringing her on</p>
<p>stage but i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and then i started writing</p>
<p>and then reading</p>
<p>some of the shit that i was</p>
<p>writing and realizing i didn&rsquo;t even know i felt that</p>
<p>because you just get in that fucking zen</p>
<p>place where you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even looking at the keyboard</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just putting</p>
<p>it out there and then you read back and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh man i didn&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s how i connected</p>
<p>those two things together or</p>
<p>so i mean i love writing it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>writing a book is</p>
<p>tough man it&rsquo;s very important for</p>
<p>comics too there&rsquo;s a lot of guys who don&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>write they just like to perform on</p>
<p>stage come up with</p>
<p>funny ideas</p>
<p>which is a great way to do it that way does it</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get the best shit</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get ideas</p>
<p>that come to you when you sit down and just write</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>could take those ideas of</p>
<p>stage and fuck around with them and tweak them</p>
<p>but if you just try to go on</p>
<p>stage just come up with</p>
<p>stuff on stage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>right yeah you have</p>
<p>to have like a little kernel of something i mean i can</p>
<p>improv if i know what i want to go up there with but</p>
<p>i hate getting caught just leaning</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re leaning up</p>
<p>there going like</p>
<p>wow what else</p>
<p>you find it really hard</p>
<p>once you do i find it very</p>
<p>hard once i do a special and then i know i have to do</p>
<p>new shit and then i&rsquo;m really like piecing</p>
<p>it together i&rsquo;m always doing a million different</p>
<p>things as once as as</p>
<p>you are too yeah i&rsquo;m always doing a million different</p>
<p>things so it&rsquo;s hard to fucking</p>
<p>piece together</p>
<p>those new shit</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>gotta do a new show and you&rsquo;re like fuck</p>
<p>these people probably already seen my special</p>
<p>yeah you know just aired</p>
<p>fucking shit</p>
<p>how much new shit do i got like 40 minutes of new shit</p>
<p>bring that back it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>forty five but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even like that but you know you said</p>
<p>kicking things</p>
<p>and i hate bringing</p>
<p>stuff back that i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>before feel so</p>
<p>wrong just feels</p>
<p>rotten feels like you&rsquo;re a shithead you&rsquo;re cheating</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re robbing them or something like that unless</p>
<p>they ask for it if people</p>
<p>scream for it if i can remember it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>like someone to yell out like and nicole smith like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>that bit&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>seven minutes</p>
<p>long and i don&rsquo;t even know i know some of the</p>
<p>punch lines</p>
<p>this may sound</p>
<p>super fucking cheesy or something like bon jovi</p>
<p>would do but during my last tour i would</p>
<p>bring somebody up out of the crowd</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d be like you know the fucking kool aid bit</p>
<p>cause i haven&rsquo;t done it in</p>
<p>12 years and they</p>
<p>do it they do it fucking</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m watching them act out</p>
<p>and they know the kick that i</p>
<p>would do or</p>
<p>whatever physical</p>
<p>thing and i&rsquo;m just like this is crazy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually pretty</p>
<p>fucking cool</p>
<p>you know i started out</p>
<p>doing comedy one of the reasons why i did come in the</p>
<p>first place was</p>
<p>reenacting comedians</p>
<p>bits that i saw on tv to my friends</p>
<p>i was like 18 19 like</p>
<p>i remember there was a girl that i was working</p>
<p>with i was working at the boston athletic club in</p>
<p>south boston</p>
<p>and i was a fitness trainer</p>
<p>this girl that was working there had seen sam kennison</p>
<p>on hbo and so she comes up to me and she goes you</p>
<p>gotta see this comedian he&rsquo;s so fucking funny</p>
<p>he does this bit</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>she gets down on</p>
<p>her stomach in the parking lot doing sam kennison&rsquo;s bed</p>
<p>about the people having sex with</p>
<p>the gay guys having sex with the corpses yeah</p>
<p>yeah and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lying down in the parking lot at the boss</p>
<p>athletic club</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>so here these guys are that&rsquo;s how he does it</p>
<p>here these guys are</p>
<p>the line on the</p>
<p>slabs like oh my god i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go to heaven i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be with</p>
<p>jesus and oh oh</p>
<p>what is this</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>some guys got his dick in my ass</p>
<p>oh you mean life keeps</p>
<p>sucking the ass even if you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>it never ends</p>
<p>she did that bit</p>
<p>for me in the parking lot and i was howling laughing</p>
<p>and i instantly became obsessed with</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>and with sam kennison i was like</p>
<p>i have to go watch this</p>
<p>this is the craziest</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>it took a long time to fucking i</p>
<p>gotta get a vhs copy of it</p>
<p>right and i finally got to</p>
<p>see it i was like holy shit so</p>
<p>would you say</p>
<p>that was obviously one of the moments that like</p>
<p>to find your formative years in</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>yeah there was</p>
<p>that and there was when i was a little kid i was</p>
<p>about 13 my parents took me to see live on the</p>
<p>sunset strip</p>
<p>and richard pryor</p>
<p>yeah to my parents were hippies</p>
<p>yeah and my</p>
<p>sister was like</p>
<p>twelve she went to shit</p>
<p>right and so we&rsquo;re in this theater</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>laughing so fucking hard i couldn&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>funny about</p>
<p>stand up comedy man because richard</p>
<p>pryor was one of the most brilliant ever for sure but</p>
<p>honestly when you watch it</p>
<p>today some of it is very dated</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t hit me the</p>
<p>way it hit me back then and that&rsquo;s the case with</p>
<p>music that&rsquo;s the case with a lot of</p>
<p>things lenny</p>
<p>bruce is one of the</p>
<p>greatest i&rsquo;ve ever and one of the most important</p>
<p>pioneers of comedy ever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to</p>
<p>laugh at his</p>
<p>stuff now because the</p>
<p>culture changes people&rsquo;s perceptions change</p>
<p>and comedy changes and</p>
<p>the comedy that you do</p>
<p>today would probably be too</p>
<p>shocking for people</p>
<p>who lived it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>comedy is defined by its certain era</p>
<p>so if you go back and</p>
<p>watch live on the</p>
<p>sunsets trip</p>
<p>today it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna hit me like it hit me when i was thirteen</p>
<p>but when i was thirteen i didn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about comedy</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t believe there was someone actually saying</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>and he was saying it&rsquo;s so perfectly</p>
<p>i was crying</p>
<p>laughing and</p>
<p>i remember looking around at this theater i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget this people were</p>
<p>moving forward in the</p>
<p>chairs and rocking back and forth</p>
<p>and i was thinking i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen anyone</p>
<p>laugh like this</p>
<p>in a movie and this guy&rsquo;s just talking</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m like i was</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>stripes cause</p>
<p>stripes had been out at the time</p>
<p>which is one of the</p>
<p>greatest comedy</p>
<p>movies ever i&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s not this funny</p>
<p>nothing is this</p>
<p>funny this is</p>
<p>crazy this guy&rsquo;s just talking</p>
<p>and that was the</p>
<p>first big seed that was huge</p>
<p>that was just</p>
<p>the seed of my fascination would</p>
<p>stand up but</p>
<p>until i got people</p>
<p>that told me that i</p>
<p>could do it i did not</p>
<p>think i could do it</p>
<p>i was teaching taekwondo and</p>
<p>fighting in tournaments and</p>
<p>these guys that i</p>
<p>would train with</p>
<p>i would make em</p>
<p>laugh in the locker room and on the way to tournaments</p>
<p>cause everybody was scared on the way to tournaments</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>get kicked and</p>
<p>punched and shit it&rsquo;s fucking terrifying</p>
<p>and a lot of guys got</p>
<p>knocked out and you get to see your friends get</p>
<p>knocked unconscious by getting kicked in the head</p>
<p>so there was a lot of gallows</p>
<p>humor on these trips</p>
<p>so i would always be the guy that</p>
<p>would like do</p>
<p>impressions of</p>
<p>all the different teammates having gay sex and all that</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how i got to talk to the dude in</p>
<p>stand up comedy man</p>
<p>fuck it some</p>
<p>stand up comedy is</p>
<p>gotta be one of the fucking</p>
<p>weirdest jobs ever</p>
<p>enter in ever</p>
<p>cause no one</p>
<p>could tell you how to do it yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s and trying to tell</p>
<p>other people what it really is we</p>
<p>could talk all day</p>
<p>you just you know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you gotta be in the fucking mix</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at your best when you&rsquo;re locked on</p>
<p>stage and crushing</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you feel</p>
<p>or do you feel</p>
<p>cause this is how i feel i feel like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just riding it</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m a passenger</p>
<p>you know i feel like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tuned into this whole</p>
<p>thing yeah i feel like as</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m hitting all the things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just i&rsquo;m on autopilot i mean i&rsquo;m in some</p>
<p>crazy groove</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m getting to watch this</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m getting to</p>
<p>experience the words coming out of my</p>
<p>mouth as they happen i have no idea</p>
<p>how the fuck it&rsquo;s all working so</p>
<p>smoothly i really can&rsquo;t even take credit for it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting because i like i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak anywhere</p>
<p>near as flawlessly as when i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>stage if i tried to tell you a bit</p>
<p>i will stammer i will fucking not remember</p>
<p>and i can groove on</p>
<p>stage sometimes like surfing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like i don&rsquo;t know how i&rsquo;m staying up</p>
<p>right wave for an hour just like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that intensity</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an intensity of communicating with people</p>
<p>you know just like</p>
<p>every cylinder</p>
<p>everything in your</p>
<p>brain just goes</p>
<p>it just all</p>
<p>fires up and it</p>
<p>cranks there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>steve martin</p>
<p>born standing up</p>
<p>where he goes</p>
<p>i can feel it in my fingernails i</p>
<p>point out i</p>
<p>can feel it in my foot the way it just moves and</p>
<p>plants i can</p>
<p>every part of my body</p>
<p>feels like it&rsquo;s emitting fucking</p>
<p>stand up but yet he hated it</p>
<p>being a standard oh my god well</p>
<p>what he hated</p>
<p>is the adulation that came when he became immediately</p>
<p>gigantically successful</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>an honest response from people anymore</p>
<p>they would start</p>
<p>screaming and</p>
<p>cheering as soon as they saw him</p>
<p>and he would do</p>
<p>these gigantic</p>
<p>arenas that he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>control and they were just totally out of control</p>
<p>which happens to</p>
<p>a lot of guys when they get big like you know chappelle</p>
<p>when he was touring he</p>
<p>would be really frustrated</p>
<p>after the rick james</p>
<p>sketch came out</p>
<p>because people</p>
<p>would be yelling out</p>
<p>everywhere i&rsquo;m rick</p>
<p>james bitch</p>
<p>he could be in the middle of</p>
<p>setup some ripped</p>
<p>chains bitch</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kick out enough people it was just it was too nutty</p>
<p>that to me honestly when dice was at his peak when i</p>
<p>first was watching the hbo specials</p>
<p>i watch young comedian</p>
<p>specials and then he had that i remember feeling like</p>
<p>how the fuck can i do this</p>
<p>but not be a character</p>
<p>how can i do this and be as real</p>
<p>still be an</p>
<p>entertainer</p>
<p>still be on but be as much me</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s none of that fucking</p>
<p>catchphrase</p>
<p>right not to see</p>
<p>people you you know everybody wants to be a little mark</p>
<p>twain you want your shit quoted yes</p>
<p>but not like that right</p>
<p>not like that not a t shirt</p>
<p>right did you get that</p>
<p>weird feeling</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s also like when you are</p>
<p>first starting out in comedy how old were you when you</p>
<p>first got on stage 19</p>
<p>i was 18 18 18</p>
<p>i was i was 21</p>
<p>and i was not a</p>
<p>fully formed person yet you know</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i am yet either</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure when i&rsquo;m 60 i look back at myself now and</p>
<p>go what the fuck kind of shit were you talking stupid</p>
<p>you know that feeling</p>
<p>but i know that</p>
<p>you know i did not have anything to say</p>
<p>there was no reason for me</p>
<p>to be up there talking right</p>
<p>i really didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>who the fuck i was i didn&rsquo;t know what i was saying i</p>
<p>could show you how to kick somebody in the face</p>
<p>i really didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>opinions that were</p>
<p>valid on anything else</p>
<p>i mean what the fuck what&rsquo;s my opinion on anything i</p>
<p>could tell you something silly my</p>
<p>girlfriend did when she was blowing me or something</p>
<p>right i could</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s it but</p>
<p>other than that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>are you but</p>
<p>you were and i</p>
<p>threw off a little</p>
<p>bit because you were saying like so then when chappelle</p>
<p>started doing the bigger</p>
<p>shows because yeah even</p>
<p>steve martin</p>
<p>he lost control of the fucking</p>
<p>did you what how</p>
<p>quick was the</p>
<p>jump between you doing clubs and you doing</p>
<p>these giant places</p>
<p>giant arenas</p>
<p>it was actually a slow but</p>
<p>steady trajectory</p>
<p>where when that web stuff</p>
<p>what happened was this in 2001</p>
<p>my first real website that i put up</p>
<p>in combination of napster</p>
<p>starting to get</p>
<p>hot and me uploading all my shit to that with the link</p>
<p>i literally uploaded clips with me at the end going</p>
<p>visitingcook com</p>
<p>at the end of every 20</p>
<p>second clip</p>
<p>then comedy</p>
<p>central i did a half hour presents that i thought</p>
<p>would are fucking</p>
<p>twat i&rsquo;m like okay</p>
<p>the one with you in the tank top</p>
<p>the tank top</p>
<p>dude i thought all</p>
<p>right you know what</p>
<p>this will air a couple of times</p>
<p>maybe i gotta</p>
<p>light a fire i&rsquo;m not wearing a bowling fucking</p>
<p>shirt with the same</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>look like what anybody else did i just want to do some</p>
<p>crazy shit maybe people fucking pay attention</p>
<p>never realizing they were</p>
<p>gonna air it</p>
<p>five times a week for like two years</p>
<p>it built my</p>
<p>whole fan base</p>
<p>and almost immediately went from a few hundred</p>
<p>seaters to you know a couple thousand</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m doing all the college</p>
<p>stuff in over</p>
<p>three four five years</p>
<p>the emails the instant messages</p>
<p>doing those schools</p>
<p>renting out the</p>
<p>arenas at the</p>
<p>schools and it just built</p>
<p>how much time do you</p>
<p>spend every day talking to fans</p>
<p>emailing you know facebook and twitter</p>
<p>and all that shit i&rsquo;ll tell you man i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i used to talk to everybody i used to</p>
<p>reply to everybody</p>
<p>if that was at the beginning</p>
<p>that was like from two thousand two thousand five</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really what i did most of my day</p>
<p>and then i got to a</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to read all the fucking</p>
<p>crazy shit that comes back and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just too</p>
<p>too many opinions and too much negativity</p>
<p>so it came down to i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>replying to</p>
<p>troops if i get letters from like and i can check</p>
<p>check by the</p>
<p>email somebody you know one of our</p>
<p>troops rights</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s like a kid</p>
<p>i write back</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been trolling as a kid for years</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t assume</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t assume</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been talking to joe</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m writing a log</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m writing</p>
<p>a book 12 year</p>
<p>old gets advice from dane</p>
<p>no but it took a</p>
<p>while man it</p>
<p>was not like everybody there&rsquo;s that old expression</p>
<p>or took 20 years to be an overnight sensation</p>
<p>it was a long time and it was not</p>
<p>it was not as instant</p>
<p>maybe as some people thought</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be satisfying though to</p>
<p>know that you know you went out here and you did some</p>
<p>movies and shit and some</p>
<p>things didn&rsquo;t connect and didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen well for you but you did it all on your own</p>
<p>like everything was done through your your own</p>
<p>you figuring out how to self help</p>
<p>self promote and you</p>
<p>changed everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attitude about it</p>
<p>no comics are good</p>
<p>promoters except</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a few it&rsquo;s very rare but</p>
<p>until you came along</p>
<p>no comics were really good at</p>
<p>self promotion totally</p>
<p>changed my attitude towards you</p>
<p>learn that from your father right</p>
<p>i did man a couple</p>
<p>things that i want to</p>
<p>give credit to joe too</p>
<p>and i told you this a long time ago like you were the</p>
<p>first person to have a website</p>
<p>not only a website but you had cool shit on your</p>
<p>website man you had fucking cool designs and fucking</p>
<p>and that is a</p>
<p>direct result</p>
<p>of my obsession with quake</p>
<p>cause i was obsessed with</p>
<p>quake and i ran into this guy andrew</p>
<p>who was this nut that i met online</p>
<p>from my quake clan</p>
<p>this is how fucked up i was i&rsquo;d have all</p>
<p>these dudes online from like kentucky and oklahoma</p>
<p>they would come and fly to</p>
<p>california and stay at my house</p>
<p>right this is when i was on newsradio yeah i was on tv</p>
<p>and dudes would come over my house</p>
<p>that i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they were just my</p>
<p>quake buddies and they really come over and stay at the</p>
<p>house yeah i&rsquo;m not bullshitting</p>
<p>i had like five dudes come over my</p>
<p>house and we had a lan</p>
<p>party wow i was so obsessed with this</p>
<p>that i put a</p>
<p>t1 line in my house</p>
<p>because back</p>
<p>then you couldn&rsquo;t get any fast internet you get isdn</p>
<p>which is not</p>
<p>quick enough</p>
<p>so i said okay how much is the</p>
<p>t1 line it was 1 000</p>
<p>a month i&rsquo;m like let&rsquo;s do this okay</p>
<p>so they fucking have to install this business grade</p>
<p>you know internet</p>
<p>line this is that&rsquo;s why you beat me all</p>
<p>those times you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>faster connection for sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it i was completely</p>
<p>wire to the</p>
<p>336 but what is it&rsquo;s your ping your ping time</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>you could be on 56 k but if you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>close to the server your ping is</p>
<p>fine it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>how fast it&rsquo;s all really just how</p>
<p>much you do it you know just become obsessed with sure</p>
<p>i saw all this you</p>
<p>start to know your</p>
<p>frame rates and we ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna fucking</p>
<p>click and bounce and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so dangerous</p>
<p>getting really addicted to</p>
<p>things like that you will lose your life yeah right</p>
<p>did you worry</p>
<p>about doing shit like that like</p>
<p>things that are that eat away your time relationships</p>
<p>marijuana relationships</p>
<p>yeah yeah how dare you</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m all listen for me all i ever</p>
<p>all i ever wanted to do is create that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not i don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>other fucking abilities</p>
<p>you know i really</p>
<p>just when i was a kid i had that epiphany moment</p>
<p>where i was like all i really care</p>
<p>about is being around performers talking</p>
<p>about performing</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>making something from nothing</p>
<p>and you brought up my dad i was like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my favorite conversations in</p>
<p>life were with him because he was the kind of guy who</p>
<p>would go yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a lot of talk dane</p>
<p>i want to see shit</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>motivating man that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s important having people that don&rsquo;t totally</p>
<p>completely believe in you</p>
<p>you know it is actually an important</p>
<p>thing the mom</p>
<p>was like oh i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>greatest you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the best your shoe is so fucking uber supportive</p>
<p>but my dad was</p>
<p>like yeah you&rsquo;re not really doing anything in order</p>
<p>for you to develop the kind of fortitude that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna need to get through</p>
<p>the hard times you have to have something to prove</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think i think it&rsquo;s too hard if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too hard to really push yourself</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a chip on your</p>
<p>shoulder or something to</p>
<p>prove or some</p>
<p>gap to fill</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna do it you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get through that</p>
<p>think about all the guys that we</p>
<p>started out with that were just as good as us</p>
<p>there was a lot of guys that were very commensurate</p>
<p>they were all really</p>
<p>you think of him</p>
<p>what happened to that guy</p>
<p>fuck man like i used to kill</p>
<p>he used to have this one bit</p>
<p>used to destroy and they just</p>
<p>could see that guy on evening at the improv</p>
<p>i could see that guy you know</p>
<p>right headlining and he just stopped</p>
<p>stop doing it</p>
<p>girls too there was this</p>
<p>chick leanne lewis</p>
<p>i was an open micer with her do you remember her</p>
<p>yeah dude she</p>
<p>had some fucking</p>
<p>good bits man</p>
<p>she was still trying to figure out how to go on</p>
<p>stage and develop</p>
<p>but as a comic</p>
<p>as a chick too especially</p>
<p>it was very like honest and out of nowhere and like</p>
<p>well written shit i was like wow this</p>
<p>chick&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>huge someday like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like ellen or</p>
<p>just disappeared just fell off just</p>
<p>where&rsquo;d you go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many fucking</p>
<p>so many slots</p>
<p>so many people</p>
<p>going towards</p>
<p>these slots yeah</p>
<p>and some of them just just too far up the</p>
<p>salmon ladder they just fuck this</p>
<p>i just can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>dan you should use</p>
<p>your hollywood</p>
<p>connections to get</p>
<p>john hughes was just about to</p>
<p>release the</p>
<p>extra hour of planes</p>
<p>trains and automobiles that they filmed</p>
<p>right before he died</p>
<p>what happened to that now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably all in the family the</p>
<p>family probably owns it and they have to figure out the</p>
<p>rights if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what he wanted i&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll probably release it</p>
<p>still why would they want to keep it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve kept it for</p>
<p>what 20 years you know he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to release it ever but then just recently he was</p>
<p>thinking about it</p>
<p>oh well i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that was awesome</p>
<p>unless it was in as well who knows what the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>i was telling you before that</p>
<p>you know one</p>
<p>steve martin moment that</p>
<p>was really cause i had dinner with him like a few</p>
<p>months ago he sent me a copy of his book</p>
<p>i was completely</p>
<p>blown away but i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never met him i</p>
<p>heard all this</p>
<p>stuff about him that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda like you</p>
<p>know maybe not</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a little socially awkward all this shit</p>
<p>what a trip it is meeting someone that</p>
<p>famous right</p>
<p>meeting really your hero too</p>
<p>which you don&rsquo;t want to do by the way</p>
<p>usually you meet your</p>
<p>heroes and you&rsquo;re like oh that was</p>
<p>kind of sucked</p>
<p>but with him</p>
<p>i was like alright he sent me a copy of his book and i</p>
<p>wrote back just to be like</p>
<p>could i take you out to</p>
<p>lunch and he agreed</p>
<p>so i sat down with him for a little bit and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really really like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i can be shy i can i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about shy but i can</p>
<p>still be like a little bit you know quiet</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s very much like</p>
<p>he won&rsquo;t say a word i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think if you don&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>start the conversation with him</p>
<p>wow but he did say to me at one</p>
<p>point he goes uh</p>
<p>he looked at me kind of like</p>
<p>perplexing he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you look like you really love it up there</p>
<p>and i was like yeah</p>
<p>i really do you know when you&rsquo;re in the middle of it</p>
<p>and i started</p>
<p>and he goes yeah i</p>
<p>never had that</p>
<p>wow i go never</p>
<p>i go not even at the and he goes</p>
<p>i never had that i</p>
<p>never felt connected when i</p>
<p>thought that</p>
<p>i thought that yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so strange</p>
<p>what i have</p>
<p>least in common</p>
<p>with steve martin&rsquo;s comedy</p>
<p>one of his isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>crazy i wonder</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>weird connect in his mind</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s depressed</p>
<p>maybe a naturally depressed person</p>
<p>well if you read a lot</p>
<p>i read a lot of the</p>
<p>stuff in the new yorker when he</p>
<p>would write oh yeah it was</p>
<p>depressing shit yeah man that letter to my father yeah</p>
<p>that says it all man</p>

<p>and phil hartman</p>
<p>was gonna set</p>
<p>steve martin up with</p>
<p>what i call a coyote</p>
<p>what a coyote is is</p>
<p>these really</p>
<p>kind of crafty professional</p>
<p>chicks that will fuck</p>
<p>celebrity guys in</p>
<p>order to try to get</p>
<p>famous try to figure out some way</p>
<p>this is pre tmz</p>
<p>okay you know now now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you know you really can fuck someone and all of a</p>
<p>sudden become hugely</p>
<p>famous right</p>
<p>that girl the</p>
<p>jesse james girl</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s her name bombshell yeah</p>
<p>the mel gibson girl</p>

<p>sudden that actually can parlay</p>
<p>into some sort of</p>
<p>something i mean who knows the fuck you can do but</p>
<p>people have your name they know</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>you are now</p>

<p>those she was just</p>
<p>kind of creepy she&rsquo;s like very insincere but really hot</p>
<p>just really beautiful but</p>
<p>you know just kind of something vacuous</p>
<p>there yeah and</p>
<p>phil was gonna set</p>
<p>steve martin up with her</p>
<p>and i forget</p>
<p>who it was one of the cast members was like that is the</p>
<p>creepiest thing ever</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like setting her up with a murderer</p>
<p>and this is before obviously phil&rsquo;s wife killed him</p>
<p>yeah but she&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>woman does not she&rsquo;s not into him</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s like looking at</p>
<p>as an opportunity she&rsquo;s like a little assassin</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna move in i was like whoa that is creepy</p>

<p>once in a while across the</p>
<p>street from the comedy</p>
<p>store we would</p>
<p>always go there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;d be really easy just walk across the</p>
<p>street and grab a drink</p>
<p>and there was always like this conversation</p>
<p>do you do coke</p>
<p>sometimes like always that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the whole conversation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like producers</p>
<p>trying to talk</p>
<p>starlets into bed</p>
<p>and coyotes preying on</p>
<p>balding jewish men with money</p>
<p>i always hear hooray for hollywood</p>
<p>during all those how much of a boring conversation</p>
<p>how much of a mind fuck is it when you actually met</p>
<p>steve martin</p>
<p>what is it when you&rsquo;re sitting there talking to him</p>

<p>such a silly fuck this is</p>
<p>for the folks on itunes fake boy a fake</p>

<p>shirt like that</p>
<p>to me like man isn&rsquo;t this the fucking coolest like i</p>

<p>guard out but i brought out my falcon</p>
<p>cuff you know like the eddy</p>
<p>rival falcon cuff</p>
<p>joe did you ever get to as far as just</p>
<p>comics that you fucking dug</p>
<p>coming up did you ever get to do shows with like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know who your</p>
<p>steve martin was or like</p>
<p>a kinsin or one of those guys like</p>
<p>domiraire is the closest</p>
<p>i got to do shows with dom at the comedy</p>
<p>store that was big to</p>
<p>me because i paid to see dom before i ever did comedy</p>
<p>and for people who don&rsquo;t know domirra</p>
<p>fuck in the late 80s and the</p>
<p>early 90s he was a</p>
<p>monster he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still a very funny guy</p>
<p>for whatever reason he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get as much attention as</p>
<p>you know i think his act deserves but back then he was</p>
<p>really really popular and i paid</p>
<p>to see him i was living in boston i took my girlfriend</p>
<p>to see him at nyx com</p>
<p>stop and i had</p>
<p>never gone on stage yet</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>in montreal</p>
<p>at the comedy festivals like i&rsquo;m working with them</p>
<p>holy shit it was only like</p>
<p>six years later</p>
<p>seven years</p>
<p>later and whatever it was really</p>
<p>fresh in my mind i was like holy fuck</p>
<p>i paid to see this guy</p>
<p>and now i&rsquo;m working</p>
<p>with them like we&rsquo;re doing a show together you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re both on the bill</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like people are</p>
<p>come to see</p>
<p>him and they come see me like what yeah you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great but you know that&rsquo;s not like you know</p>
<p>he became a friend</p>
<p>he came normal</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>but i never got to see like my real</p>
<p>i got to see a few of my real</p>
<p>influences live i saw hicks live</p>
<p>i saw him live like four or five times</p>
<p>it was pretty wild</p>
<p>i saw him live when no one knew who he was</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for comedy historians</p>
<p>when hicks when i</p>
<p>first saw him he was</p>
<p>very similar to sam kennison</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where it was like he was</p>
<p>stealing his</p>
<p>essence i would say</p>
<p>right you know like you the</p>
<p>steve dunm thing</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good way of describing it</p>
<p>right when i</p>
<p>first saw him</p>
<p>he was making kinesin</p>
<p>like noises</p>
<p>and doing like</p>
<p>sounds like in</p>
<p>between bits like the bit didn&rsquo;t go so well and he did</p>
<p>this kinesin</p>
<p>like thing i was like wow</p>
<p>this guy was like</p>
<p>connected to kinesin&rsquo;s like thing</p>
<p>right and it makes</p>
<p>sense because he was like one of the guys that</p>
<p>opened with kinesin and followed him around the road</p>
<p>but he got out of that</p>
<p>quickly we all are</p>
<p>influenced by</p>
<p>other guys i know you had an anthony</p>
<p>clark period i had a richard</p>
<p>jenny period</p>
<p>where i stopped myself on</p>
<p>stage and i realized i</p>
<p>sounded like my cadence and everything</p>
<p>was richard jennings i was a big richard</p>
<p>jenny fan yeah</p>
<p>yeah i was like i</p>
<p>gotta stop myself</p>
<p>like but a lot</p>
<p>of people don&rsquo;t know that hicks had that with kinesin</p>
<p>everybody thinks is hicks</p>
<p>especially because he&rsquo;s dead of this</p>
<p>who is an amazing comedian and very</p>
<p>influential and</p>
<p>very unique</p>
<p>but all of us</p>
<p>have this weird</p>
<p>thing where we want to be like someone we admire</p>
<p>and sometimes it</p>
<p>sounds like it on stage</p>
<p>but he stopped that</p>
<p>after a while i saw him once and he had it like that</p>
<p>and then i saw him again</p>
<p>just like six</p>
<p>months later and he didn&rsquo;t do any of that</p>
<p>and he had a</p>
<p>bunch of new shit</p>
<p>i saw him do a headliner set</p>
<p>at the comedy</p>
<p>connection and then a headliner set</p>
<p>literally like six</p>
<p>months later and there&rsquo;s a totally new hour</p>
<p>right and i was like wow</p>
<p>he just he figured it out</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s that moment we all have</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like you just something clicks</p>
<p>and you finally realize all</p>
<p>right this is what i need to do or this is my voice or</p>
<p>truth or whatever the fuck it is he</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about it for a guy who&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>you mean i believe</p>
<p>when he died he was only 32 years old</p>
<p>his ideas and philosophies and the the</p>
<p>validity of his opinions were so advanced</p>
<p>right you know for a person of that</p>
<p>age because really like most 25 year</p>
<p>old guys he was 25 when he was doing a lot of his act</p>
<p>right most 25 year old guys</p>
<p>you better shut the fuck up if you</p>
<p>wanna tell me how the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s running just</p>
<p>stop just you don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t give me any</p>
<p>nutty fucking nine eleven conspiracy website bullshit</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re fucking what are you</p>
<p>twenty four dude really</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t tell me how to run the</p>
<p>world just let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grow a little</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get some life</p>
<p>experience then</p>
<p>give it to me from</p>
<p>the perspective</p>
<p>of someone who&rsquo;s actually seen something</p>
<p>but he was advanced</p>
<p>25 26 27 really relevant</p>
<p>points and really good material there&rsquo;s no bad period</p>
<p>when you look at his material</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like there was no period</p>
<p>where it was bad it got better and better and better</p>
<p>i think one</p>
<p>thing that he really</p>
<p>latched onto and</p>
<p>maybe it was</p>
<p>after going through the</p>
<p>the kennison</p>
<p>influence was like</p>
<p>and i appreciated</p>
<p>was like this release of</p>
<p>whatever emotion it seemed was</p>
<p>going through him</p>
<p>he just allowed it to come out even if it was mid other</p>
<p>story or idea</p>
<p>and i would just</p>
<p>watch that and i remember</p>
<p>thinking that was like empowering</p>
<p>i was like wow this is a</p>
<p>place where you can go up and you can fucking ring</p>
<p>shit out and people you know with a joke i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a good song sometimes you don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>lyrics to a song</p>
<p>you just love the fucking song you realize years</p>
<p>later like i don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re saying here</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>and i think with some</p>
<p>comedians it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even so much about</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is how they&rsquo;re expressing something emotionally behind</p>
<p>that those are the guys that i always</p>
<p>watch i mean carlin of course prior</p>
<p>it was like there was</p>
<p>truth mixed with</p>
<p>just humor just random</p>
<p>ideas you know what i got to see too i got to see</p>
<p>kinesin become not so good</p>
<p>that was a fascinating</p>
<p>thing kennison who was my</p>
<p>the guy remember i told you that</p>
<p>chick you know doing that</p>
<p>thing in the parking lot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a got me in a comedy i mean</p>
<p>literally that&rsquo;s that was the bug</p>
<p>that planted it</p>
<p>and i got to see him perform live</p>
<p>after he had gotten really</p>
<p>famous and really</p>
<p>successful and he</p>
<p>would come on</p>
<p>stage with the two girls and the</p>
<p>whole thing and it was like i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>laugh yeah he stopped being</p>
<p>funny he became like this caricature of this guy</p>
<p>you listened to louder than hell his</p>
<p>first cd or whatever it was you listen to that</p>
<p>still today</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good still</p>
<p>but if you go and you know you look at like the</p>
<p>stuff that he did like</p>
<p>right before he died</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good at all yeah well he got caught up in that</p>
<p>mtv wild thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re right it was like the</p>
<p>trench code became an</p>
<p>outfit like</p>
<p>it was like a costume yeah yeah</p>
<p>well dice for a while</p>
<p>kinda had the same thing</p>
<p>going on too</p>
<p>where he became the dice man</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>dice man was a character that he used to do on</p>
<p>stage right</p>
<p>and he used to do</p>
<p>these john travolta</p>
<p>impressions yes on the</p>
<p>young comedians</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i really like</p>
<p>thought he was really out of</p>
<p>strong it was</p>
<p>fucking brilliant likable</p>
<p>charismatic yeah</p>
<p>i mean when dice</p>
<p>burst onto the</p>
<p>scene i mean i</p>
<p>think i was</p>
<p>right out of high school</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>thinking that was the funniest shit i&rsquo;d ever</p>
<p>heard in my life</p>
<p>you know and then hanging out with that guy at the</p>
<p>comic store years and years</p>
<p>later and just like he&rsquo;s like a normal guy</p>
<p>right you know but now he like</p>
<p>is the dice man full time</p>
<p>it was a character and now he&rsquo;s got this</p>
<p>leather jacket on and the</p>
<p>gloves on it&rsquo;s full time now</p>
<p>i have a theory that it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a character not just</p>
<p>a character but like look at any sitcoms or any fucking</p>
<p>throughout history</p>
<p>if you play a character</p>
<p>especially with</p>
<p>a weird name</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re like a pot</p>
<p>see or a bundy</p>
<p>right you like you</p>
<p>but then you become okay i need to keep that hairdo</p>
<p>i need to be recognized</p>
<p>from that era</p>
<p>and you play into it and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s frustrating when</p>
<p>you see that but it&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>never wanted to be a character man</p>
<p>i was like i&rsquo;d rather change and not be as funny</p>
<p>but still have</p>
<p>certain fans and i&rsquo;ve had this happen i&rsquo;ve had fans go</p>
<p>dude i like your</p>
<p>stuff back when i first</p>
<p>i know but i was a kid i was talking</p>
<p>about kids shit</p>
<p>i was still new it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if i didn&rsquo;t change you</p>
<p>would not fucking</p>
<p>hang out and care at all what i was doing</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s people that are</p>
<p>gonna like you at one</p>
<p>stage your career not at another and that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they are they are</p>
<p>where you were at that</p>
<p>stage your career exactly it&rsquo;s alright you</p>
<p>know whatever</p>
<p>sorry i love that</p>
<p>sorry i lost you</p>
<p>i got some new people</p>
<p>along the way i lost a few i got a few stragglers</p>
<p>that becomes what you crave</p>
<p>i really believe because at</p>
<p>first you just want to you know i get to keep my fans i</p>
<p>gotta i can hold on am i</p>
<p>gonna make him happy</p>
<p>and when you let go of that</p>
<p>and you realize somebody&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>check out for a</p>
<p>while and then i had a guy</p>
<p>write me an</p>
<p>email and he goes dude listen i jumped on the hate</p>
<p>train or whatever i didn&rsquo;t like you i listened</p>
<p>isolated incident</p>
<p>heard you talking about your</p>
<p>folks talking</p>
<p>about shit that i&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m back in man i&rsquo;m hanging out i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting back on</p>
<p>the dane train</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s cool man that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people that can</p>
<p>check in and out</p>
<p>like i respect that you know i do the same thing with</p>
<p>music i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always like what somebody&rsquo;s putting out but of</p>
<p>course i always listen</p>
<p>perfect example that exactly doing</p>
<p>sound garden then he was doing dog shit now he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>sound gardening</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s right awesome i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still here all</p>
<p>right i just yeah</p>
<p>i bought that other</p>
<p>stuff i just wasn&rsquo;t into it yeah but</p>
<p>you know go</p>
<p>ahead take your</p>
<p>chances who the fuck knows what makes the</p>
<p>connection you know</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t take that chance</p>
<p>as soon as you</p>
<p>start thinking</p>
<p>about like wow</p>
<p>i have to do what they want then you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>because then you don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it has to be what you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s inside of you but that&rsquo;s how many guys</p>
<p>you guys see this it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when people</p>
<p>new comics come to you out here and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what do i need to do i&rsquo;m like get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t come up here because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be like packaged and immediately like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a stigma on you</p>
<p>leave well there</p>
<p>were so many guys at the la factory that became you</p>
<p>when you became famous</p>
<p>when it was</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>happen even when you were packing dublins all the time</p>
<p>there was i noticed</p>
<p>so many guys that were like doing you on</p>
<p>stage i was like wow this</p>
<p>is fucking crazy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these guys that</p>
<p>have noticed something that&rsquo;s working and they</p>
<p>just jumping on it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>thing to see</p>
<p>you know like a</p>
<p>whole new wave you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wave of guys that came out of the</p>
<p>laugh factory joe coy</p>
<p>that sound just like you</p>
<p>and mitch hedberg</p>
<p>and stan hopes there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these like clones of</p>
<p>clones yeah</p>
<p>yeah well a lot of mitch hedberg guys</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s a lot of guys that oh my</p>
<p>god and guys that were like pretty good</p>
<p>comics but they&rsquo;re like dude you</p>
<p>gotta stop doing that</p>
<p>yeah i know you&rsquo;re good you have some good jokes but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m the cerebral</p>
<p>just this rebuilds like yeah yeah</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like did you doing mitch hedberg</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you man</p>
<p>it was fascinating to</p>
<p>okay when it happened and it was like fuck i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>famous i&rsquo;m known</p>
<p>people are talking</p>
<p>about me when i&rsquo;m not trying to fucking get something</p>
<p>going and the dj is like</p>
<p>that was really they were setting this tempo</p>
<p>and then there were guys that you see come out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little flattering and weird</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like oh this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda like me and it makes you not</p>
<p>wanna watch comedy because you&rsquo;re a little</p>
<p>freaked out by it</p>
<p>but then you know</p>
<p>that all right couple years down the line</p>
<p>as guys start getting frustrated</p>
<p>those same guys are the ones who</p>
<p>would come out of the woodwork and say</p>
<p>oh no dane fucking took from me</p>
<p>i was doing that shit</p>
<p>that is true</p>
<p>that will happen and guys will forget that they</p>
<p>stole it from you</p>
<p>right that does happen they&rsquo;ll forget that they</p>
<p>got the idea to behave that way from you and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>decide in their head</p>
<p>somehow that they were doing it</p>
<p>first but you guys</p>
<p>would do that but you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it like you just nailed it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>you take that you have a</p>
<p>voice you have</p>
<p>certain people that you want to emulate and</p>
<p>then you figure out your shit and you grow out of it</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m as kind of</p>
<p>understanding and cool</p>
<p>about that because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been up down up down and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but in the beginning though you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel that way in the beginning you feel like someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stealing from you and</p>
<p>you put a stop to it</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>famous and you&rsquo;re struggling and you&rsquo;re coming up and</p>
<p>you know and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>starting to do well and then you see somebody</p>
<p>start ganking off you and you&rsquo;re like hey hey hey</p>
<p>i created all this</p>
<p>success at a</p>
<p>hard work and you&rsquo;re just kind of like emulating it</p>
<p>you better stop doing that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing what you saw be successful</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a version of me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tricky man that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tricky thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tricky</p>
<p>thing because it just feels like someone</p>
<p>i mean really you got to let them do it you know i mean</p>
<p>look if you become</p>
<p>successful just through the merit</p>
<p>of your own work it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be really</p>
<p>clear who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>copying and</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s imitating who</p>
<p>but it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel like that</p>
<p>in the beginning in the beginning when you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like if someone&rsquo;s doing me now i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>look at this guy why are you doing that like well i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>right i did kind</p>
<p>of fucking flattering even though it&rsquo;s kinda old</p>
<p>you know but you figured they</p>
<p>would be done with it</p>
<p>i mean i was doing it when i was an open micer you know</p>
<p>i was doing it like it was a year in or two years in</p>
<p>you know i would hear myself</p>
<p>sound like somebody</p>
<p>else but when someone&rsquo;s doing it and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their act on comedy central you&rsquo;re like okay man</p>
<p>you took this too far</p>
<p>you have to do your own</p>
<p>thing you have to have your own delivery yes</p>
<p>and you know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny because the</p>
<p>first time in my life i ever ran in that was with you</p>
<p>when we had you know</p>
<p>it was like 1998 and joe called me up i remember i was</p>
<p>still living in that shitty</p>
<p>apartment and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>dude there&rsquo;s a fucking bit that you&rsquo;re doing and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my closing bit</p>
<p>i remember i</p>
<p>was so fucked up by that not only because it was like</p>
<p>you know i had a lot of respect for joe but it was like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t ever want to be one of those guys</p>
<p>that gets you know put in that position</p>
<p>and i remember feeling like that was a</p>
<p>defining moment for me</p>
<p>cause it was like</p>
<p>i need to talk even more</p>
<p>about maybe not nostalgic</p>
<p>things or things that are outward</p>
<p>that i see but</p>
<p>things that are from me</p>
<p>that happened to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard though because</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>influenced by someone else and your bit is</p>
<p>influenced by</p>
<p>their bit and even though you know it is</p>
<p>you know you shouldn&rsquo;t probably do it because everyone</p>
<p>thinks that you kind of stole it</p>
<p>but it kills</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem when i fucking</p>
<p>crush it it&rsquo;s all you have at that and it&rsquo;s such a life</p>
<p>bid it&rsquo;s just you know you</p>
<p>could go up there with this one and just fucking</p>
<p>slam it in yeah</p>
<p>but really ethically</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you have to find out what&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>about that and cut</p>
<p>it out and try to add it to something that you create</p>
<p>you know you can be</p>
<p>influenced by something</p>
<p>and you know and you&rsquo;re not even you&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>aware of it you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot you never see</p>
<p>a lot of guys</p>
<p>like work together like we saw that at the comedy</p>
<p>store a lot</p>
<p>where guys would work together and guys</p>
<p>would riff in the back parking lot and then they</p>
<p>would go on stage and</p>
<p>it was like a battle over</p>
<p>whose bit is this</p>
<p>whose bit is this we&rsquo;re sitting out</p>
<p>like stanhope had this fucking</p>
<p>guy that was opening for him this guy was a douche</p>
<p>and he would go on</p>
<p>stage and whenever they</p>
<p>would fucking</p>
<p>riff stanhope</p>
<p>would say a</p>
<p>bunch of cool shit and this guy</p>
<p>would go on</p>
<p>stage and do</p>
<p>stanhope&rsquo;s cool shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like fuck man now i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t riff in</p>
<p>front of you</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t just fuck around and come up with it but then</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still two are</p>
<p>doing it together and</p>
<p>then you know you got to figure out well whose is this</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>you know or somebody like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have an idea an original premise</p>
<p>and someone will add a tag to it and then take your</p>
<p>whole fucking</p>
<p>thing and jump on stage</p>
<p>they added a tag like no i</p>
<p>just came up with that to this day like</p>
<p>bobby and al</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>known al since i was a kid 13 years old</p>
<p>bobby since i</p>
<p>started robert</p>
<p>kelly and us</p>
<p>three definitely</p>
<p>i can hear it all the time</p>
<p>bobby does certain</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;m like oh that</p>
<p>sounds like me or</p>
<p>all three of us</p>
<p>cause we started we</p>
<p>spent so much fucking time together we formed our</p>
<p>kind of comic</p>
<p>cadences and all the</p>
<p>tricks that you</p>
<p>learned that</p>
<p>those are the two guys that i can</p>
<p>still watch and be like oh that&rsquo;s how we</p>
<p>influenced each</p>
<p>other i have one</p>
<p>friend when i come up with an idea i have to walk away</p>
<p>i walk away and i say it in my head and i</p>
<p>write it down</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t say it in</p>
<p>front of them because if i say it in</p>
<p>front of them i&rsquo;m pretty sure that it&rsquo;s eventually</p>
<p>going to go on stage</p>
<p>oh my god so i have to go away</p>
<p>i fucking really do that</p>
<p>yeah yeah and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>the worst is</p>
<p>the one friend that you have an idea and you</p>
<p>start saying the idea and they try to top it and they</p>
<p>start talking over you like no no no</p>
<p>no this is delicate it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming out of nowhere it&rsquo;s coming out of outer space</p>
<p>let me say it</p>
<p>could you fucking imagine</p>
<p>if imagine if oprah decided</p>
<p>that she was</p>
<p>tired of all this play</p>
<p>yeah maybe she</p>
<p>would just stop stop</p>
<p>stop stop talking</p>
<p>if you talk</p>
<p>right now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna i&rsquo;m gonna miss i&rsquo;m getting a gift</p>
<p>right now from the universe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ideas like</p>
<p>crazy ideas sometimes will come to you</p>
<p>fully formed</p>
<p>but if you start talking and explaining it to</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>and then someone jams in with</p>
<p>their own shit it&rsquo;s like oh it&rsquo;s lost now yes</p>
<p>or if they start</p>
<p>trying to get to what you&rsquo;re getting to</p>
<p>because they kind of get a</p>
<p>sense of it like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrong territorial</p>
<p>pissings are wrong or</p>
<p>wrong and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like no that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m saying at all</p>
<p>and then like fuck</p>
<p>lost all my momentum communications dead that&rsquo;s we</p>
<p>should all text each other</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waiting the</p>
<p>whole time for</p>
<p>that brian you</p>
<p>call me chris</p>

<p>about eight</p>
<p>months single so she was she was there for the big ride</p>
<p>for most of it yeah yeah</p>
<p>what would finally just</p>
<p>drove the nail</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s everything a lot man yeah she in the business</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>it was it yes but i went through a lot of shit man my</p>
<p>folks and then</p>
<p>into my brother</p>
<p>roughest four five years ever</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;re even functioning</p>
<p>you know sometimes i am too mad because it really was a</p>
<p>you know i lived</p>
<p>to perform cause</p>
<p>my folks were just the coolest fucking people and</p>
<p>but they got to see</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ve come to the you know at the end of all the</p>
<p>talking about it and</p>
<p>figuring out it&rsquo;s like they got to see</p>
<p>everything i want do you find it&rsquo;s hard to date</p>
<p>chicks in the business</p>
<p>mmm right now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just having fun so i&rsquo;m just kind of like doing whatever</p>
<p>but i would not want to settle down with a headshot no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why i have a no headshots possible yeah</p>
<p>yeah seven year</p>
<p>seven year period a</p>
<p>great that&rsquo;s it no headshots</p>
<p>after seven years you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had a headshot in</p>
<p>seven years okay you&rsquo;re good you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>clear you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>clear you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>escaped the spell</p>
<p>you know but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>real housewives of calabasas all</p>
<p>these crazy bitches</p>
<p>out there they all wanted to be actresses yeah man</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m fucked up okay but i figured out</p>
<p>how to deal with my fucked up and make it work and be</p>
<p>a fairly healthy</p>
<p>human being but i know that</p>
<p>other people that are</p>
<p>fucked up like the odds are</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>able to talk and hang out and be cool with each</p>
<p>other and make this work out and</p>
<p>both be balanced it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>the odds are very very</p>
<p>small that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have your shit together and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have a healthy relationship you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s just like too many times over and over and</p>
<p>again you just deal with all these</p>
<p>crazy people and all this</p>
<p>psychosis involved in</p>
<p>the auditioning process</p>
<p>breaks people&rsquo;s souls</p>
<p>because this getting this</p>
<p>movie or getting this</p>
<p>television show or anything they&rsquo;re auditioning for</p>
<p>could be the biggest</p>
<p>fucking moment in their life</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>freaking out and they&rsquo;re pacing</p>
<p>around the waiting room and you get to see them go over</p>
<p>their lines like it&rsquo;s it makes</p>
<p>i went for i read for a sitcom like six months ago</p>
<p>i got nervous being in the room with all</p>
<p>these people that were nervous</p>
<p>right i was like i just</p>
<p>wanna get the</p>
<p>fuck out of here like this is a terrible feeling</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>money i don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about shit this just seems like a</p>
<p>bit of a fun job</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking at all</p>
<p>these people like this is like</p>
<p>their big fucking</p>
<p>thing their big break</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>every day over and over</p>
<p>again getting rejected getting rejected</p>
<p>needing that love getting rejected</p>
<p>i love getting rejected so</p>
<p>close but nope</p>
<p>final three no no</p>
<p>no and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing this for years and years</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>already a person who psychologically unbalanced</p>
<p>already a person who</p>
<p>the reason why they want to be a performer in the</p>
<p>first place is they want to be</p>
<p>loved because they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t love as a child</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s this incredible horrible imbalance</p>
<p>and they just can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite connect and then</p>
<p>you start dating them and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>look man you&rsquo;re not on a comfortable road</p>
<p>like this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be smooth and</p>
<p>relaxed and everyone&rsquo;s carefree</p>
<p>this is gonna be constant</p>
<p>psychosis do you</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m good do you</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m fat is this good is</p>
<p>what am i a</p>
<p>loser will you read lines with me oh</p>
<p>fuck all our</p>
<p>friends are</p>
<p>like that though</p>
<p>you know yeah but i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>dating our friends yeah but they</p>
<p>should yeah but they</p>
<p>still have that same kind of fucking</p>
<p>doing that five times a day</p>
<p>every day yeah but they have success as</p>
<p>comics that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the difference guys like joey and are yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to auditions all the time</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also killing it on</p>
<p>stage all the time</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing comedy all the time you know</p>
<p>and joey&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>getting acting gigs here and there so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>ari&rsquo;s always getting you know</p>
<p>commercials</p>
<p>here and there they have it out ari&rsquo;s doing well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the people that are not making the</p>
<p>connection and girls too</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a girl man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a natural feeling i</p>
<p>think for a girl</p>
<p>to want some sort of male companionship and</p>
<p>protection for a</p>
<p>woman to be by herself comes here from like</p>
<p>omaha nebraska or something</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be incredibly insecure like a cork in the middle of the</p>
<p>ocean by herself anyway</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any friends committed to this acting thing</p>
<p>and then just rejection rejection</p>
<p>rejection and then</p>
<p>their whole</p>
<p>childhood thing that drag them there in the</p>
<p>first place then you come</p>
<p>along and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>hey do you like to go see a movie</p>
<p>even know what the fuck you&rsquo;re getting into</p>
<p>right you just open up the door to hell</p>
<p>my ex was one of the</p>
<p>classic cases of</p>
<p>everything that</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know till</p>
<p>after the breakup</p>
<p>everything she always said she hated she became</p>
<p>like literally</p>
<p>every fucking facet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why they hate they hate what i mean what they hate</p>
<p>is what they&rsquo;re afraid of in themselves right</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s tough because then people go</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>like people that are further</p>
<p>along in this industry when</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always like what&rsquo;s your gem what can you you know</p>
<p>what can i learn from you and they go</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna be with</p>
<p>a girl who&rsquo;s in the industry but then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like if somebody who isn&rsquo;t how do they really fucking</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>bullshit that i then have to deal with and</p>
<p>right so what&rsquo;s that middle ground</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s that girl in the middle we can find girls and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve met girls in</p>
<p>the business that are really cool it&rsquo;s just really rare</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of them that are just really</p>
<p>normal they</p>
<p>just like acting</p>
<p>i am kind of dating a girl now but</p>
<p>after what i&rsquo;ve been through you&rsquo;re kind of more</p>
<p>trepidatious because you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>go through that in there</p>
<p>trepidatious is a very rare word</p>
<p>thank you that was</p>
<p>strong thank</p>
<p>you strong move</p>
<p>charlie yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of people who do</p>
<p>think that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find someone</p>
<p>you know in the business but</p>
<p>you can it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just rare you know you can&rsquo;t rule it out but as a rule</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna have an</p>
<p>ethic it should be a no headshots policy</p>
<p>find some normal</p>
<p>chick i have a head and butt shot policy</p>
<p>i like the way through the little gulp in the middle</p>

<p>happy i&rsquo;m balanced</p>
<p>you know after some</p>
<p>crazy you know years</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just trying to</p>
<p>have fun i&rsquo;m just trying to</p>
<p>enjoy it man yeah yeah</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing you guys it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i had this moment</p>
<p>was like i had a good year when i hit</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like this is</p>
<p>dream come true time and i really did</p>
<p>enjoy it and then it was like i</p>
<p>took care of my family and</p>
<p>i had money</p>
<p>and then a lot of</p>
<p>stuff happened</p>
<p>so i you know a lot of</p>
<p>stuff happened whether it was like internal</p>
<p>from you know</p>
<p>comedians or whether it was you know my</p>
<p>folks being sick or</p>
<p>all the shit</p>
<p>yeah dog shitting and getting evicted</p>
<p>it was like i didn&rsquo;t have time to just be a regular</p>
<p>like person</p>
<p>in process everything</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve really done the last</p>
<p>year so you</p>
<p>find that i find that</p>
<p>it drives me really</p>
<p>crazy when i come up with</p>
<p>a bit and then i put it on a special and then right</p>
<p>after i fucking film it i have a way better tagline</p>
<p>it drives me nuts</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like i let this go too</p>
<p>quick i should have worked on this like</p>
<p>part of the process of developing material</p>
<p>is you got to do a bit over and over and over again</p>
<p>until you find the</p>
<p>rhythm of it you</p>
<p>find you know</p>
<p>the natural</p>
<p>order of the words and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never done no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never done man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>great things</p>
<p>about those guys in boston that the untold</p>
<p>story of why they were so good</p>
<p>is those guys had the same act forever</p>
<p>i mean a lot of</p>
<p>those guys unfortunately</p>
<p>kept the same act for years and years</p>
<p>and years and</p>
<p>people actually grew to</p>
<p>expect it they</p>
<p>would go see</p>
<p>steve sweeney</p>
<p>who was fucking brilliant</p>
<p>but it was the same brilliant</p>
<p>20 minutes that you had seen</p>
<p>seven years ago and</p>
<p>they had it down</p>
<p>and they had</p>
<p>their act and it was a fucking machete</p>
<p>and it would just</p>
<p>slice through the</p>
<p>crowd it was just</p>
<p>all the timing was terminators yeah</p>
<p>the timing was just perfect you know</p>
<p>the timing was just deadly there were so many of</p>
<p>those guys then too</p>
<p>yeah yeah if you come out with a bit</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>develop it enough it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>maybe you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite get it out the perfect way</p>
<p>you know people love new</p>
<p>shit and that&rsquo;s more important to them than anything</p>
<p>but you wanna like god you</p>
<p>wanna make sure it&rsquo;s done yeah</p>
<p>wanna make sure it&rsquo;s really done i kind of was like a</p>
<p>few years back fell into this routine of like you know</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s never done</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s always kind of</p>
<p>evolving in something else</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s just again more</p>
<p>about who i am</p>
<p>because i loved guys like even johnny carson growing</p>
<p>up i didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck johnny was talking</p>
<p>about half the time when i was a kid</p>
<p>but it was like this idea of oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re attracted to</p>
<p>this person</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something glamorous</p>
<p>about stand up</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t go anywhere else</p>
<p>except for maybe what we&rsquo;re doing here today</p>
<p>without somebody impeding on it</p>
<p>and like editing it or some</p>
<p>standards and practice</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always somebody fucking with you</p>
<p>except comedies</p>
<p>glamorous cause you can say whatever</p>
<p>it is you wanna</p>
<p>say and that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that i love</p>
<p>about this podcast too is this</p>
<p>is so look how easy this is yeah</p>
<p>we just have a</p>
<p>couch and a webcam</p>
<p>and a fucking</p>
<p>table and a laptop it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s all and a</p>
<p>flashlight that you can fuck</p>
<p>and a flashlight that you can fuck and some</p>
<p>microphones</p>
<p>and no one can tell you what to do and look</p>
<p>you know look it&rsquo;s not polished</p>
<p>is not we don&rsquo;t edit it we just</p>
<p>fucking it&rsquo;s just a conversation it&rsquo;s a conversation</p>
<p>every week you</p>
<p>might like it we hope you do</p>
<p>yeah but no one&rsquo;s fucking with and</p>
<p>it becomes itself and you don&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>other people digging</p>
<p>their fingers in it and</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ll take this over any like any</p>
<p>even like whatever reality</p>
<p>like everything so processed</p>
<p>and so fucking prepared right that</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t something be a little ragtag a little</p>
<p>messy and real</p>
<p>yeah and maybe a little uncomfortable and really</p>
<p>you know have an amazing moment well for you i</p>
<p>think this is very important because</p>
<p>because i think you&rsquo;re a very misunderstood guy</p>
<p>and the ability</p>
<p>to express yourself for long</p>
<p>periods of time will get a chance for someone to see</p>
<p>your real personality</p>
<p>as opposed to this projected imager</p>
<p>that they have of</p>
<p>you i get that yeah you</p>
<p>know so this is like</p>
<p>a great medium</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re doing like a fucking tonight</p>
<p>show set or something like that you&rsquo;re sitting on the</p>
<p>couch you&rsquo;re talking for</p>
<p>seven minutes</p>
<p>to me it always feels like it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>who was i was i me did i get it out</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>you know did i just</p>
<p>fucking force this for</p>
<p>seven minutes</p>
<p>yeah fuck yeah</p>
<p>so nobody really</p>
<p>i mean this is a fantastic opportunity that we have</p>
<p>today to do something like this this didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>for performers of</p>
<p>other generations i mean</p>
<p>the ability</p>
<p>to let people really know who you are</p>
<p>warts and all this</p>
<p>is exactly who we are and seeing</p>
<p>comics and however many</p>
<p>entertainers like go from</p>
<p>this to getting that fame or fan base or whatever it is</p>
<p>without anybody in the middle of it without</p>
<p>managers and agents and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty incredible</p>
<p>man bob bob burnham</p>
<p>yeah bo bo burna bo burnham</p>
<p>bo burnham he&rsquo;s like 18 or something isn&rsquo;t he a really</p>
<p>young kid yeah</p>

<p>everywhere he did a</p>
<p>bunch of shit on youtube and people</p>
<p>loved his songs on youtube like comedic songs</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden this kid is fucking packing</p>
<p>places right</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s incredible just because of the internet</p>
<p>that kid that was on</p>
<p>ellen that kid that</p>
<p>sang that paparazzi song</p>
<p>the lady gaga song was brilliant it was at like a</p>
<p>school talent festival or something like that</p>
<p>and this kid was fucking</p>
<p>brilliant yeah and now</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>real singing</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s amazing it&rsquo;s like you instantly</p>
<p>you know can connect to people that just</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t available</p>
<p>before you before you had a go through</p>
<p>magazine but let&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>devils advocate for a</p>
<p>minute because how fucking</p>
<p>quickly is that kid fucked up now</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s dying</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>fights like he&rsquo;s out of that fucking</p>

<p>there will be a certain</p>
<p>chew em up spit em out process with some of</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>that make it</p>
<p>through there it&rsquo;s like people who win the lottery</p>

<p>they would know</p>
<p>where you were at all times they know exactly the</p>

<p>best odds on hands and</p>
<p>anything else so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>or hackers that just</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been caught that are sitting there like</p>
<p>call of duty behind a wall and</p>
<p>watching your</p>
<p>hand exactly</p>

<p>what&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>placed and they&rsquo;ll tell you the best word</p>
<p>from the dictionary is 12</p>
<p>points so play scrabble play old school</p>
<p>labeling some people sitting around that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>we live in a society</p>
<p>where people feel</p>

<p>famous and you see that</p>
<p>their hearts beating fast and</p>
<p>their hands are shaking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wow</p>
<p>just just because they&rsquo;ve seen your</p>
<p>image broadcast</p>
<p>somewhere or they thought you did something that they</p>
<p>enjoyed that</p>
<p>would be with</p>
<p>the matrix baby</p>
<p>steve martin that&rsquo;s how it</p>
<p>would be yeah</p>
<p>steve martins like be like pantaleonian</p>
<p>matrix eats one</p>

<p>right before the jerk yeah</p>
<p>fuck man and he told me i was asking</p>
<p>about the jerk</p>
<p>cause as much as i</p>
<p>could i was like you know</p>
<p>once he warmed up i was like tell me a little about</p>
<p>the jerk and</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>i was just driving to the gig</p>
<p>every day with kyle weiner and we&rsquo;re like is this</p>
<p>funny is this funny</p>
<p>they were just doing what comics do</p>
<p>and then get to set and make it work wow yeah</p>
<p>yeah they were like we had no clue what we were doing</p>
<p>or how big that was</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>i want to know what happened with him because there was</p>
<p>definitely a</p>
<p>point in his time kind of</p>
<p>after planes</p>
<p>trains and auto</p>
<p>bills around</p>
<p>grand canyon times</p>
<p>where it seemed like he just stopped playing</p>
<p>steve martin and</p>
<p>started acting like a</p>
<p>old man or something like</p>
<p>no more crazy</p>
<p>he was forcing the</p>
<p>crazy what you&rsquo;re feeling on that don&rsquo;t a lot of</p>
<p>comics want</p>
<p>to be like you got to take me serious a lot of</p>
<p>comics go through that</p>
<p>phase where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a serious</p>
<p>human being happen stop smoking weed</p>
<p>what about that</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>where where</p>
<p>comics want to be</p>
<p>taken seriously and they</p>
<p>start like making</p>
<p>points on stage that aren&rsquo;t funny</p>
<p>horror yeah oh</p>
<p>i work with this</p>
<p>comic once i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say his name but he&rsquo;s a political guy</p>
<p>pretty famous guy and</p>
<p>he did this line and then he said</p>
<p>that usually gets an applause break</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t even remotely funny some</p>
<p>silly fucking democrat versus republican point that</p>
<p>should be obvious to anybody&rsquo;s paying attention</p>
<p>and it was just like wow like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going for that like</p>
<p>they lose this</p>
<p>perspective and all of a sudden they start</p>
<p>thinking that they&rsquo;re like this</p>
<p>voice of reason</p>
<p>that people need to hear</p>
<p>yeah like come on man you&rsquo;re supposed to just be funny</p>
<p>right if you don&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>funny to say about a subject</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s not setting up something</p>
<p>funny later</p>
<p>yeah you know i understand if you wanna like get a</p>
<p>point across or give a perspective</p>
<p>that may not be funny but it gives us your</p>
<p>point of view so i understand what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about when you say some funny shit later</p>
<p>but if you start preaching</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>tricky thing right yeah yeah no no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how many guys</p>
<p>have seen do it though a lot right yeah yeah</p>
<p>and it seemed like there was like a</p>
<p>phase not as much now but a few years ago</p>
<p>where everybody was trying to do that you know</p>
<p>where everybody was like this is the</p>
<p>point in my act where i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>dim the lights and do bill maher real talk</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m there</p>
<p>for fucking yucks man i&rsquo;m there to make you</p>
<p>laugh your ass</p>
<p>off i&rsquo;m there to make you escape for a little bit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking guys that do it</p>
<p>a thousand times</p>
<p>better than me but i figured out how to do it my way to</p>
<p>where i can</p>
<p>entertain you</p>
<p>and we can all forget</p>
<p>about the real hardcore shit for a little bit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m supposed to do man yeah</p>
<p>really if i can do some</p>
<p>flicks if i can produce some tv</p>
<p>stuff great</p>
<p>i love comedy that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to mean shit like joey diaz is one of my favorite guys</p>
<p>to watch ever cause</p>
<p>everything is up my ass and my balls and my dick</p>
<p>shut up suck my costume</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a boston</p>
<p>too everything</p>
<p>ended up up the ass if you</p>
<p>could get the fucking</p>
<p>if you had no</p>
<p>end of your joke</p>
<p>it ended up up your ass i</p>
<p>appreciate like really deep</p>
<p>thinkers and i</p>
<p>appreciate people with really fascinating</p>
<p>points of view</p>
<p>but for the most part</p>
<p>a lot of that</p>
<p>stuff is not funny</p>
<p>a lot of that</p>
<p>stuff really it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re disrespecting certain topics by doing them on</p>
<p>stage i mean you can kind of like</p>
<p>brush on it and like</p>
<p>kind of like</p>
<p>dabble in it but</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a really fascinating subject</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that needs to be</p>
<p>explored and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be funny</p>
<p>just for flat out funny</p>
<p>like for me i like</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>like a joey diaz type guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of shit i laugh at</p>
<p>i wanna you</p>
<p>know i wanna</p>
<p>laugh at someone i mean i love good writing and</p>
<p>everything like that</p>
<p>but i love just as much</p>
<p>joey diaz he&rsquo;s got this joke</p>
<p>about transvestites</p>
<p>he goes i love</p>
<p>transvestites</p>
<p>they cook they</p>
<p>clean you can beat on them</p>

<p>black eye it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great that&rsquo;s like just bang bang bang</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>laughing it&rsquo;s a great joke</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>tremendous joke</p>
<p>but you know i&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of shit that&rsquo;ll make me clap and laugh</p>

<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my favorite kind of comedy i like just</p>

<p>think he you know he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an architect</p>
<p>man he gets out there and he fucking figures out and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just funny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just about fucking being funny</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna use his</p>
<p>power to you know like you know do that try to get yeah</p>
<p>just funny cat man just it&rsquo;s all pure</p>
<p>i like to watching</p>
<p>you know chappelle</p>
<p>before you know he kind of disappeared</p>
<p>you know i always appreciated</p>
<p>watching dave get up</p>
<p>as a guy who&rsquo;s like on the same</p>
<p>level as him like fame wise does it</p>
<p>freak you out that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fucking perform in these big</p>
<p>places does it</p>
<p>freak you out there like you aren&rsquo;t you like</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you like let people know</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be man</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you do more shows</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s one of the best ever</p>
<p>one of the best ever</p>
<p>right now and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so rare</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>dave personally it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all like i don&rsquo;t have insight but just from what i hear</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>stuff to work out</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s just not in a</p>
<p>place where he can face that head on</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m putting it</p>
<p>yeah i know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about i mean i</p>
<p>heard that crazy</p>
<p>story about the</p>
<p>whatever the hell happened on the airplane</p>
<p>right where they had to land somewhere and the pilot</p>
<p>thought that he was a hazard to the flight</p>
<p>so they landed</p>
<p>early yeah that&rsquo;s extreme</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s extreme</p>
<p>stuff i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on but</p>
<p>i met him when</p>
<p>i did i mean the comedy clubs in new york and</p>
<p>i did this appel show</p>
<p>twice and he says so he&rsquo;s been a cool dude but i</p>
<p>never got to know</p>
<p>deep yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s like that though i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think a lot of people know him</p>
<p>really personally he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda you know</p>
<p>living in fucking utah or somewhere and just i oh</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah it&rsquo;s strange huh</p>
<p>yeah but you know that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that i said also that i</p>
<p>think people really love</p>
<p>about him is the fact that he is</p>
<p>kind of reclusive he is kind of like the reluctant star</p>
<p>and one of the</p>
<p>things that people will like go</p>
<p>after you is</p>
<p>like the you already have attention so they&rsquo;re like why</p>
<p>this fucking guy want more attention</p>
<p>right yeah you fucking attention whore</p>
<p>look at this attention or show your</p>
<p>mouth attention whore</p>
<p>yeah no it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s what it is like people</p>
<p>think that like when you promote if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>self promoting that somehow or another</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re doing something to them sure</p>
<p>you know do you get</p>
<p>fucking spamming me</p>
<p>it but it you know any</p>
<p>any level of</p>
<p>success and what i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned having you know</p>
<p>again slow but</p>
<p>short trajectory is like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>more people that don&rsquo;t like what you do then</p>
<p>of course like</p>
<p>what you do and that&rsquo;s it and you just attract</p>
<p>more of people</p>
<p>that like you more</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like you will be attracted to you and tell you</p>
<p>of course like i said i&rsquo;m totally hypocritical</p>
<p>i hated a serious man and</p>
<p>i went on twitter and i&rsquo;m like seriously fucking sucked</p>
<p>if somebody</p>
<p>could have seen me</p>
<p>perform and</p>
<p>did the same thing but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay though you</p>
<p>gotta realize that you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna people there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>music that i fucking love</p>
<p>and you know if</p>
<p>mrs rogan gets in the car with</p>
<p>me she&rsquo;s like what the fuck are you listening to right</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like this is i was made for loving you okay</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know this you don&rsquo;t know this fucking song</p>
<p>you know somebody like chapelle</p>
<p>though i mean regardless of what he&rsquo;s dealing with</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many when</p>
<p>steve martin did arenas</p>
<p>steve martin</p>
<p>was doing also</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t doing like when people say like</p>
<p>arenas today</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>maybe twenty thousand people</p>
<p>that dude was doing fucking</p>
<p>sixty thousand people</p>
<p>in an arena</p>
<p>where he was partitioned</p>
<p>with no screens</p>
<p>nothing man mike</p>
<p>white suit dot on the</p>
<p>other side of the</p>
<p>place so you understand</p>
<p>but with me it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i have the most amazing</p>
<p>like the guy that comes out my road guy aldotley he did</p>
<p>zeppelin he did elvis</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got all the</p>
<p>gadgets we put</p>
<p>screens we make</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re in your living room</p>
<p>i go in the middle not because i want to be a gladiator</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s four theaters</p>
<p>at any point it&rsquo;s easier to be</p>
<p>close to people from the middle it wasn&rsquo;t like a thing</p>
<p>where it was like yeah by being in the middle on the</p>
<p>on the rock stars no it&rsquo;s like i need to be as</p>
<p>close to people in</p>
<p>these big shows</p>
<p>as possible i&rsquo;ve only done one theater in the</p>
<p>round show ever</p>
<p>maybe two was</p>
<p>it in cape cod no</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>what was the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>turned remember that round</p>
<p>yeah what was that one</p>
<p>that was a minute where</p>
<p>was that where</p>
<p>it would like the whole</p>
<p>stage was that</p>
<p>phoenix turned i</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>phoenix yeah i did something if it is</p>
<p>it always weirded me out that people were behind me</p>
<p>you know fucking</p>
<p>this is strange i&rsquo;m performing</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not looking there&rsquo;s people behind me like that</p>
<p>yeah i couldn&rsquo;t get past that</p>
<p>that was freaking me out</p>
<p>but what you</p>
<p>really is smarter</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like more more dynamic it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>three dimensional approach</p>
<p>as opposed to i love</p>
<p>it standing</p>
<p>in this one</p>
<p>plane facing this one way</p>
<p>every time yeah when people are behind you too</p>
<p>and i always keep a little</p>
<p>light on everybody</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a constant flow of energy</p>
<p>by seeing other people</p>
<p>and feeling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s something unique</p>
<p>about being in the middle</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>people not just you yes they&rsquo;re not just seeing a</p>
<p>stage with you they&rsquo;re seeing people</p>
<p>watching you and that isn&rsquo;t at it</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>absolutely that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting way to look at it yeah like everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like whoa we&rsquo;re on this together you&rsquo;re just talking</p>
<p>about on an energy</p>
<p>level if you want to talk</p>
<p>about that like for me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what you put out there and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t dissipate</p>
<p>the way i feel it does when you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>launching it at them like you&rsquo;re meant to look at me</p>
<p>when they feel like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their part of it they&rsquo;re connected to it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>kind of comedy man it&rsquo;s a different show and the</p>
<p>screens look i got all four</p>
<p>so even when my backs to you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never a bad seat</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re up top</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking directly out at a</p>
<p>screen so we figure out how to make it work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty fucking bad yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be really strange do shows</p>
<p>for that many people what is it like to do a show for</p>
<p>twenty i think</p>
<p>the most i&rsquo;ve ever come out and do it man next time i</p>
<p>do a gig come out and do</p>
<p>you know come out and open</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you are</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m serious</p>
<p>maybe i always have people you know</p>
<p>people have</p>
<p>never done those shot size</p>
<p>shows on the last tour</p>
<p>i just feel like dude come out come out</p>
<p>and it was great man and everybody</p>
<p>thinks i&rsquo;m not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna work for me there it&rsquo;s like no</p>
<p>first of all my fans are comedy fans</p>

<p>kind of people that get like oh we&rsquo;re just waiting for</p>

<p>can&rsquo;t you imagine eating shit on stage</p>

<p>and i was middling i shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have been middling i really didn&rsquo;t have the time</p>
<p>and the guy went on before me fucking crushed</p>
<p>and there was this</p>
<p>chick that i</p>
<p>had seen the last time i was there and she was</p>
<p>super hot and i fucked her</p>
<p>and she was in the</p>
<p>front row and she brought her friends</p>
<p>and her friends look and they were</p>
<p>going to sit in the</p>
<p>front row when i went on</p>
<p>stage so i was panicking</p>
<p>i was like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be like</p>
<p>right in front of me i was only like a year into comedy</p>
<p>year and a half</p>
<p>almost and this guy went up who was the mc</p>
<p>was way better than me</p>
<p>he was already better than me</p>
<p>and i was like i conned this fucking book me</p>
<p>into making me a middle</p>
<p>i was like it&rsquo;s just a cocky douche i was like i</p>
<p>could be i can middle come on i can middle</p>
<p>so he lets me middle</p>
<p>and this guy goes on</p>
<p>stage and destroys</p>
<p>and he stopped</p>
<p>doing comedy he&rsquo;s really too bad he&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>his name unfortunately but he fucking killed</p>
<p>and then i went</p>
<p>after him in</p>
<p>eight just dry</p>
<p>bricks of shit</p>
<p>with no water for 20 minutes</p>
<p>it was the most embarrassing feeling i&rsquo;d ever</p>
<p>had in my life i couldn&rsquo;t believe how unbearable it was</p>
<p>and her and her friends were like looking at each</p>
<p>other and her friends</p>
<p>would lean over and say something like you have friends</p>
<p>oh no and then i</p>
<p>could hear crickets and i&rsquo;m trying to be like</p>
<p>extra loud because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to bring it back to my side</p>
<p>so you force the</p>
<p>punch lines and the timing is all off and</p>
<p>it sucks even worse</p>
<p>and my only</p>
<p>experience with being nervous before</p>
<p>my only experience with pressure had been</p>
<p>fighting so when</p>
<p>fighting in tournaments</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re nervous you just turn inward</p>
<p>and you say this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fucking explode i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna fucking go</p>
<p>go go you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>terrified but</p>
<p>you just get</p>
<p>psyched up to go</p>
<p>which is the</p>
<p>worst thing you</p>
<p>could ever do on stage</p>
<p>to be nervous and</p>
<p>aggressive and</p>
<p>fucking and all</p>
<p>introspective</p>
<p>and turned into yourself i don&rsquo;t give a fuck what they</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m just gonna go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>mindset ever for comedy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called being</p>
<p>carlos mencia</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna turn it in i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna explode</p>
<p>the most feud</p>
<p>i had to do</p>
<p>did you ever do shows without microphones oh yeah yeah</p>
<p>i remember parties ever do a</p>
<p>batch party on the mic i did yeah i used to do like</p>
<p>colleges around boston</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;d hire me and i&rsquo;d be like where this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be standing on a pool table</p>
<p>i did one in the cafeteria</p>
<p>standing on a cafeteria chair</p>
<p>table yeah ricky</p>
<p>table like i couldn&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>that was their</p>
<p>stage i did a place</p>
<p>in in florida called the wrath skeller</p>
<p>they hired me to come down and it was like one of my</p>
<p>first road gigs</p>
<p>and it was the</p>
<p>thing where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s food being served during the tvs are on</p>
<p>like all that shit</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like the whole</p>
<p>everything is happening</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>stand up and</p>
<p>somebody threw a hot dog at me like</p>
<p>five minutes into an hour</p>
<p>those gigs are so important man all</p>
<p>those shit gigs that boston comedy used to book and all</p>
<p>those little</p>
<p>weird fucking</p>
<p>places in new hampshire you would</p>
<p>drive an hour and a half up to</p>
<p>new hampshire and do some</p>
<p>weird bar with a tinny</p>
<p>sound system</p>
<p>those are so good though</p>
<p>when you look back at it now how important were those</p>
<p>like for developing your ability to like</p>
<p>focus on stage and kill and</p>
<p>cut the fat out of your act and</p>
<p>driving home from orno maine once</p>
<p>i got a gig up there and it was the</p>
<p>first time that</p>
<p>a few years and i</p>
<p>drove home and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>all right this matters</p>
<p>even though it was horrible i was like this matters</p>
<p>this someday</p>
<p>i will look back on tonight and know that i</p>
<p>learned fucking something here</p>
<p>oh man but it was</p>
<p>you never want to come back yeah you do</p>
<p>those gigs and you&rsquo;re just like wow like this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even feel like show business it feels like</p>
<p>i did a thing with this guy</p>
<p>scott papper curie</p>
<p>he used to book the mana poisit</p>
<p>in this little tiny shithole</p>
<p>but it was a</p>
<p>great little room</p>
<p>where i got to see</p>
<p>teddy bergeron by the way</p>
<p>who was a fucking</p>
<p>genius yes one of the best</p>
<p>comics ever</p>

<p>could this guy not be in everybody&rsquo;s</p>

<p>comics ever yeah</p>
<p>and this guy</p>
<p>scott pepe cura</p>
<p>book to gig for he and i on</p>
<p>block island</p>
<p>and block island</p>
<p>is like an island outside of rhode island i think</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing there it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>drunk retarded fishermen</p>
<p>and they are dumb as fuck and they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>drunk they are</p>
<p>all of them there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe 20 people in the room</p>
<p>all of them are so</p>
<p>drunk they can&rsquo;t even keep</p>
<p>their eyes open</p>
<p>their mouths are sliding like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here</p>
<p>and we have to do comedy for them</p>
<p>and scott gets up and</p>
<p>starts shitting all over them and he was</p>
<p>not really you know he hadn&rsquo;t been doing comedy that</p>
<p>long then really probably shouldn&rsquo;t have been on stage</p>
<p>in this sort of a situation anyway</p>
<p>and i went on</p>
<p>after them and they had already turned</p>
<p>their backs to the comedy show like half of them</p>
<p>they turned</p>
<p>their backs and just</p>
<p>started a conversation</p>
<p>and we had to stay in</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t in a hotel room it was in a supply room</p>
<p>they had two cots in a</p>
<p>supply room</p>
<p>with no shower</p>
<p>there was a bathroom</p>
<p>you know we could take like you know</p>
<p>a horse bath yeah a horse bath</p>
<p>and you know we stayed in this little fucking</p>
<p>supply room</p>
<p>until we could catch the boat back the next day oh man</p>
<p>i did so many of those little one i mean</p>
<p>colleges where there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>site i got a gig</p>
<p>i know at the time yeah at the time you&rsquo;re like all</p>
<p>right i get a gig i&rsquo;m making</p>
<p>fifty bucks or whatever it was but oh man</p>
<p>brutal bangor</p>
<p>maine i did a bunch up there yeah</p>
<p>i did a bunch for norm lafoe he had all</p>
<p>these gigs in western massachusetts</p>
<p>way out there where you had to</p>
<p>drive 40 miles an hour because deer would jump in</p>
<p>front of your fucking car every five minutes</p>
<p>you had to be careful that you didn&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>like you get to these certain gates yeah</p>
<p>these berkshire shows yeah</p>
<p>especially western mass</p>
<p>out near amherst</p>
<p>i remember there was a lot of two lane roads</p>
<p>where you would see dead deer all over the</p>
<p>place right</p>
<p>fucking wrecked cars yeah</p>
<p>i nailed one one</p>
<p>night did you yeah</p>
<p>yeah just his ass had just gotten past me and i did the</p>
<p>thing where i gunned it i&rsquo;m like i wanted to swerve</p>
<p>the voice was like coming</p>
<p>and i fucking hit him and</p>
<p>i watched him spin off into the woods</p>
<p>did you can die</p>
<p>from that a lot of people have died from hitting like</p>
<p>especially if you hit a fucking</p>
<p>moose yeah if you hit a</p>
<p>moose you might be dead that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>way to go through the windshield and</p>
<p>crush your fucking</p>
<p>spine yeah right</p>
<p>i had a dream that mike goldberg guy i work with in the</p>
<p>ufc got killed by a grizzly bear</p>
<p>and it was a very</p>
<p>graphic movie</p>
<p>in my head like a very</p>
<p>graphic dream</p>
<p>where it was very realistic</p>
<p>right and i woke up like</p>
<p>literally woke up like whoa</p>
<p>like he was</p>
<p>with his wife and his kids and they were in a river</p>
<p>and a fucking</p>
<p>grizzly bear came running through the bank of the river</p>
<p>jumped into the</p>
<p>water and just fucked him up in</p>
<p>front of everybody jesus</p>
<p>yeah very strange</p>
<p>so mike goldberg if you&rsquo;re listening but yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go camping don&rsquo;t go in the river</p>
<p>yeah stay the fuck away do you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the future of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like 30 years from now that&rsquo;s what fucking</p>
<p>sports gonna be it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>literally be like a guy oh yeah</p>
<p>mixed martial arts verse</p>
<p>some kind of hybrid dna government</p>
<p>experiments like half fucking cougar</p>
<p>the only reason why there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>sword fights on tv is</p>
<p>cause no one&rsquo;s put</p>
<p>sword fights on tv</p>
<p>if they were people</p>
<p>would love to</p>
<p>watch that two guys with samurai</p>
<p>swords trying to hack each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s fucking heads on i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna produce our very</p>
<p>first show together joe</p>
<p>i love it the lions</p>
<p>versus the christians i mean</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t much different than us today</p>
<p>how is that different</p>
<p>than ghettogaggers com how is that different than</p>
<p>some of the shit that you watch like</p>
<p>those mexican drug dealers</p>
<p>cutting that guy&rsquo;s head off with a</p>
<p>small knife have you seen that video</p>
<p>you see the</p>
<p>suicide jump yeah</p>
<p>off the fucking overhead</p>
<p>just explodes</p>
<p>yeah his head it blows up like a coconut</p>
<p>that yeah kid</p>
<p>awful you can&rsquo;t unsee that</p>
<p>stuff but you</p>
<p>should know that it&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>you know when you see someone really fucking</p>
<p>shifty when you go to 7 eleven you</p>
<p>should know this guy</p>
<p>might pull out a gun he</p>
<p>might commit</p>
<p>suicide yeah</p>
<p>who the fuck knows i mean</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen so much fucked up shit on the internet i think</p>
<p>to a certain extent</p>
<p>it influences people&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>and it makes people a little bit more fucked up than</p>
<p>maybe they could be because they have all this nutty</p>
<p>stuff that they have access to</p>
<p>but on the other side you</p>
<p>should be more</p>
<p>aware of what is possible</p>
<p>you might be a good person who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always around nice people you&rsquo;re a mormon or something</p>
<p>and so you think everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mellow and predictable</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re around some fucking</p>
<p>gang banger and you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck this is</p>
<p>right you don&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>rules are you don&rsquo;t know what game he&rsquo;s playing yeah</p>
<p>and you know what most people don&rsquo;t realize in</p>
<p>those situations you have no</p>
<p>you better fight your fucking ass off</p>
<p>when you see people</p>
<p>going along with it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>this is gonna be bad right</p>
<p>i saw a guy get</p>
<p>knocked out he</p>
<p>looked like he did</p>
<p>these thugs just</p>
<p>found him coming out of a</p>
<p>looks like a convenience store</p>
<p>they knocked him out</p>
<p>knocked him out</p>
<p>unconscious the guy falls</p>
<p>bangs his head off the concrete out cold</p>
<p>arms up in the air stiff</p>
<p>and the dude</p>
<p>starts pissing on his face</p>
<p>dude pulls a dick and pissed on it just decided to</p>
<p>knock this guy out out of nowhere</p>
<p>like you need</p>
<p>to know that there&rsquo;s people like that out there</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>shit i mean you can be paranoid and fucking</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>start dwelling on them</p>
<p>and get all</p>
<p>second amendment</p>
<p>right but how do</p>
<p>you get to know that person they have a facebook page</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m into</p>
<p>knocking people out</p>
<p>then my wrap up is</p>
<p>my tag is i piss on you just</p>
<p>it was hard</p>
<p>to watch follow</p>
<p>me on twitter it was hard to watch</p>
<p>cause you see the dude</p>
<p>half conscious</p>
<p>and the piss is hitting his face and just moving</p>
<p>that could be you it</p>
<p>could be anybody anybody somebody decides to just</p>
<p>steal on you&rsquo;re in the wrong</p>
<p>place at the wrong time</p>
<p>and some guy who you</p>
<p>never saw come and decides to</p>
<p>punch you in the face and</p>
<p>piss on your</p>
<p>unconscious body</p>
<p>and on that note</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s the end of this fucking podcast</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m glad you came over</p>
<p>again we&rsquo;re sponsored by the flashlight</p>
<p>flashlight com</p>
<p>you and i have had our differences over the year but</p>
<p>i always respected your ability to</p>
<p>market yourself and</p>
<p>i always respected your ambition i</p>
<p>think sometimes when people are ambitious</p>
<p>things don&rsquo;t necessarily work out the way they</p>
<p>should be but</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;re a good dude</p>
<p>and i know that you&rsquo;re always working on</p>
<p>your act i see it all the time i know you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>right things and i</p>
<p>hear your interviews and i know you&rsquo;re in a good place</p>
<p>with your mind and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s important man</p>
<p>and i think it&rsquo;s also important that</p>
<p>at a certain</p>
<p>stage in your life you have to</p>
<p>recognize when you&rsquo;ve had differences with somebody and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that i don&rsquo;t like you as a person</p>
<p>you know just differences</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m glad that we put all that shit past and</p>
<p>oh man that means the</p>
<p>world hearing that from me joe</p>
<p>you know you get a lot of</p>
<p>integrity and i&rsquo;ve always had a lot of respect for you</p>
<p>which is part of the reason that</p>
<p>there was for me on my side</p>
<p>when anybody ever came to me with anything it was like</p>
<p>i have really nothing to say</p>
<p>about it and i hope that time will just</p>
<p>eventually figure that out so i</p>
<p>appreciate that good to be hearing your show will do it</p>
<p>again yeah dude for sure for sure and i think</p>
<p>stuff like this</p>
<p>like i said is perfect for a guy like you</p>
<p>so people really</p>
<p>get a chance to see who you really are true no bullshit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think anybody</p>
<p>who was thrust into your condition</p>
<p>is gonna come out of it without some</p>
<p>scrapes i mean you thrust yourself into</p>
<p>really like a</p>
<p>a stratosphere</p>
<p>like that very few</p>
<p>human beings ever have to</p>
<p>navigate comedy</p>
<p>low and you did it</p>
<p>yeah you did it over a very</p>
<p>short period of time</p>
<p>i think people need to respect that i</p>
<p>think you did an awesome job</p>
<p>thanks and you got through it and you&rsquo;re doing all the</p>
<p>right shit and i</p>
<p>enjoyed how you did that isolated incident</p>
<p>i was telling people like i love how you did it all</p>
<p>in one take and you</p>
<p>did it all like with one</p>
<p>camera like</p>
<p>right on the</p>
<p>stand you could tell there was no edits to it</p>
<p>like that was</p>
<p>really cool that was like a cool creative choice</p>
<p>you know so i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re doing some awesome</p>
<p>shit oh thanks man</p>
<p>thank you keep</p>
<p>up the good work keep it good luck</p>
<p>with your writing let me get that program by the way</p>
<p>yeah write room</p>
<p>folks who are into it i</p>
<p>think it only works for the mac but i know that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a version of it for the pc as well that does the</p>
<p>exact same thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>for all you creative types who are easily distracted</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also easily distracted and you have a hard time writing</p>
<p>pick up this book called the war of art</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s stephen</p>
<p>pressfield is the guy rody ever</p>
<p>heard of it no</p>
<p>fucking incredible</p>
<p>war of art i bought a</p>
<p>bunch of them and i give them out to people</p>
<p>yeah i think i</p>
<p>might have one</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give one to you it&rsquo;s an amazing book and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about how you</p>
<p>can overcome resistance and</p>
<p>focus your mind for writing</p>
<p>really really brilliant book</p>
<p>i need that</p>
<p>everybody does read</p>
<p>the book man but</p>
<p>he was talking he talks</p>
<p>about it in the book me here&rsquo;s a guy who really</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t become</p>
<p>successful as a writer</p>
<p>until he was in his 40s</p>
<p>and he recognizes his own</p>
<p>errors and what his own</p>
<p>bad patterns of thought and</p>
<p>he sort of addresses</p>
<p>all of them that all creative types have in this thing</p>
<p>cool anyway</p>
