and I</p><p>just said you know we need to find out</p><p>what you did because it obviously worked</p><p>it was a great success so I just wanted</p><p>to find out a little bit your are you</p><p>living in California right now Austin</p><p>Texas</p><p>okay similar yeah real close and then</p><p>you will you overweight your whole life</p><p>yes I was overweight since I can</p><p>remember I remember third grade I</p><p>couldn&rsquo;t fit in my desk so I had to tell</p><p>my mom and she had to go talk to my</p><p>teacher about adjusting the desk I</p><p>remember wanting to learn how to</p><p>ice-skate and our the instructor told my</p><p>dad decide so limit like it was kind of</p><p>hard to support my weight on skates and</p><p>it was things like that all throughout</p><p>my my life until my early 20s well</p><p>actually in high school I did terrible</p><p>kind of dieting that girls do and it was</p><p>just up and down all the time Wow at the</p><p>time do you have any brothers or sisters</p><p>yes were they did they have a weight</p><p>problem - no well some of - to do to</p><p>don&rsquo;t so it was just it&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s been</p><p>kind of a study for me to see a</p><p>household where people have eaten the</p><p>same things and it almost felt like a</p><p>why me kind of thing for a while - what</p><p>about your parents do they have a way to</p><p>show yes both of them do interesting but</p><p>I was adopted so genetics are a little</p><p>different</p><p>so it&rsquo;s been really interesting for me</p><p>to watch what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your</p><p>nationality were you from originally I</p><p>will I&rsquo;m Korean I was born in Seoul</p><p>Korea but I was adopted when I was about</p><p>three months old Wow</p><p>I just one little side point I had a</p><p>patient come in she&rsquo;s from Korea and</p><p>very overweight she&rsquo;s the only one in</p><p>the family overweight and which really</p><p>really sucked for her</p><p>her sister was mrs. universe just like</p><p>my life all right</p><p>my sister is like she&rsquo;s gorgeous she&rsquo;s</p><p>real thin and it creates this um it just</p><p>it was really hard yeah I couldn&rsquo;t I</p><p>could only imagine because in fact this</p><p>patient she ate so much better than her</p><p>sister but you know right that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s interesting okay so you went</p><p>along you hit your 20s and then what</p><p>happened then I tried to eat healthy and</p><p>exercise I think a lot of I was probably</p><p>220 I&rsquo;m at my heaviest so a lot of the</p><p>way it was pretty easy to lose and then</p><p>once I got to a certain way it just I</p><p>kind of plateaued for years it was up</p><p>and down but probably till about 170 is</p><p>when it just plateaued and kind of it&rsquo;s</p><p>just been up and down ever since</p><p>interesting and what are you what did</p><p>you start did you find something like if</p><p>you find the ketosis and in a minute</p><p>faster did you find that recently or is</p><p>that something you&rsquo;ve been doing for a</p><p>while I just found it about four months</p><p>ago I had heard about it through to</p><p>people and I actually found it for</p><p>mental clarity and my my struggle with</p><p>my weight has been all the time and I</p><p>kind of never felt like there was a</p><p>light at the end of the tunnel it&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of like I didn&rsquo;t know in a month from</p><p>now am I going to be 10 pounds heavier</p><p>or am I going to be 2 pounds lighter I</p><p>have no I had no idea was this always a</p><p>crapshoot so it&rsquo;s I found it for I cut</p><p>sugar out and then I started researching</p><p>and I found the ketogenic diet which is</p><p>so much fun like I had so much fun with</p><p>food ever since I started and it&rsquo;s just</p><p>wet dieting before I felt like I was</p><p>always avoiding things with no fun stuff</p><p>on the other side but now I feel like</p><p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s delicious and it&rsquo;s doable</p><p>and I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m depriving</p><p>myself and I&rsquo;m</p><p>I&rsquo;m I love it Wow and has it helped you</p><p>in other ways health-wise</p><p>oh my anxiety I have anxiety some well I</p><p>do have anxiety and it has I have almost</p><p>no anxiety besides like the natural</p><p>anxiety nothing crazy like I used to get</p><p>and I I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s been crazy for</p><p>me because it&rsquo;s just been so helpful</p><p>with my mood and I do intermittent fast</p><p>I fast for sixteen hours and then eat</p><p>for eight and I by eleven o&rsquo;clock at</p><p>work in the morning I feel like a body</p><p>buzz almost where I just it&rsquo;s so crazy I</p><p>can just feel the effects I was fasting</p><p>and how it feels great and I never</p><p>thought that fasting would feel good</p><p>where I just feel energy and I just feel</p><p>like bouncing off the walls with</p><p>happiness it&rsquo;s really weird</p><p>that&rsquo;s very interesting now has it</p><p>helped you wait so far yes I&rsquo;ve lost so</p><p>the first the first two months I lost</p><p>weight fast Ellis probably ten pounds</p><p>and now first I was trying to get the</p><p>first month I lost ten pounds and so I</p><p>was expecting it to go at that rate and</p><p>then it&rsquo;s sort of plateaued but what&rsquo;s</p><p>been awesome about the diet is that I</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to eat any other way with</p><p>other diets it was like oh forget this</p><p>I&rsquo;m not doing this anymore it&rsquo;s not</p><p>working I&rsquo;m going back to this or that</p><p>and now I&rsquo;m just like I love the way</p><p>that I feel mentally that I don&rsquo;t even</p><p>care like I just want to continue</p><p>honestly and I think of it this way if I</p><p>only lose two pounds like every month or</p><p>every other month in a year and a half</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to be where I would want to be</p><p>and I don&rsquo;t want to change anything</p><p>because of how it makes me feel mentally</p><p>Wow</p><p>it makes me feel great um the anxiety</p><p>it&rsquo;s been and sweating for me I used to</p><p>think that I had body temperature issues</p><p>and ever since I started the ketogenic</p><p>diet</p><p>I don&rsquo;t drip sweat which has been really</p><p>interesting it&rsquo;s just been a complete</p><p>change in my body that&rsquo;s amazing</p><p>what about your size inches are you</p><p>finding that you&rsquo;re shrinking yes so I</p><p>actually have no idea how much I weigh</p><p>right now I&rsquo;ve stayed away from the</p><p>scale because at one point where I was</p><p>feeling absolutely great I decided to</p><p>get on a scale and it didn&rsquo;t move at all</p><p>in a month and I had felt inch inches</p><p>wise that I was definitely making some</p><p>progress but I hadn&rsquo;t been measuring</p><p>myself so I said that I&rsquo;m not going to</p><p>do anything until I start measuring</p><p>because the scale seems to be not a good</p><p>indicator where I&rsquo;m at</p><p>based on how my clothes are getting so</p><p>that&rsquo;s a good place to interject cause</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about that the main</p><p>thing with ketosis is you want to get</p><p>yourself in the fat-burning but the</p><p>thing is when you do intermittent</p><p>fasting you preserve protein and muscle</p><p>in the body you actually can regrow more</p><p>muscle which is more dense so you&rsquo;ll be</p><p>shrinking but the scale might stay the</p><p>same the main thing is are you shrinking</p><p>do you feel good if you feel good</p><p>mentally your hunger cravings are gone</p><p>that means you&rsquo;re in ketosis it&rsquo;s</p><p>working but I imagine with you Leanne if</p><p>you have this problem your whole life</p><p>and you&rsquo;re 18 years old now yeah then</p><p>that means that it takes a little longer</p><p>to be able to get to your goal but yeah</p><p>if you&rsquo;re seeing changes along the way</p><p>man ride the wave and then you could</p><p>always start to okay work on seven hour</p><p>window okay good you got that down six</p><p>are going to do it gradually and then to</p><p>your point where your four-hour window</p><p>of eating which takes time to graduate</p><p>into but more hours of fasting but yeah</p><p>I agree the feeling when you&rsquo;re fasting</p><p>you&rsquo;re living off your own fat it&rsquo;s a</p><p>mental clarity there&rsquo;s less stress</p><p>there&rsquo;s less waste products for the</p><p>brain I mean can you imagine how many</p><p>people that could get off psych drugs if</p><p>they went on this I mean Prozac and</p><p>Ritalin</p><p>I mean just or other psych drugs like</p><p>wellbutrin and abilify which is the</p><p>number one psych drug out there it&rsquo;s</p><p>amazing</p><p>I used to rely on xanax sometimes for</p><p>cute anxiety and I I wouldn&rsquo;t want to</p><p>touch it because it would mess with</p><p>where I&rsquo;m at now and I just feel great</p><p>almost all the time that I don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to drink I don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>take anything for anxiety I don&rsquo;t want</p><p>to do anything besides feel what I feel</p><p>now and it&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s almost shocking</p><p>because I never thought there was a</p><p>point in my life that I could get where</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t have an edge that needed to be</p><p>taken off and it&rsquo;s definitely due to the</p><p>ketogenic diet and it just makes me kind</p><p>of I&rsquo;m trying to be over minded about</p><p>carbs but it almost makes me know that</p><p>they just don&rsquo;t work for me</p><p>weight wise and mentally right I mean</p><p>that&rsquo;s why I was recommend the vegetable</p><p>carbohydrate because you need the</p><p>vitamins and minerals somehow and that&rsquo;s</p><p>you can get them from organ meats but a</p><p>lot of people just don&rsquo;t want to eat</p><p>liver kidney and brain anymore so then</p><p>we have vegetables left right when did</p><p>you when did you find my videos Oh</p><p>probably when I first started the</p><p>ketogenic diet so like form four months</p><p>ago and they definitely wear my goat my</p><p>go-to for because everybody has their</p><p>different opinions that aren&rsquo;t really</p><p>science based on science or it&rsquo;s based</p><p>on experience and I felt like you kind</p><p>of gave me the facts like I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>really have to wonder about more of an</p><p>opinion it was all just scientific facts</p><p>it felt like awesome well it&rsquo;s obviously</p><p>working and so you know he want to ride</p><p>the wave and so can you give me an</p><p>example of what you would eat on a given</p><p>meal for breakfast at noon I usually eat</p><p>either sausage and bacon and eggs</p><p>guacamole that I make just with avocado</p><p>and salt and lime juice and a little bit</p><p>of garlic powder and then I&rsquo;ll do sour</p><p>cream sometimes depending on where I&rsquo;m</p><p>at how I&rsquo;m feeling sometimes I&rsquo;ll try to</p><p>be low on fat I&rsquo;ve definitely learned</p><p>that fat is not a target it&rsquo;s funny</p><p>because when I first started the</p><p>ketogenic diet I was like mmm fat</p><p>everywhere but I was I realized more</p><p>that it&rsquo;s not a goal for the day it&rsquo;s</p><p>kind of just like a guide so depending</p><p>on how I feel I&rsquo;ll eat the sour cream</p><p>with it and I&rsquo;ve been trying to do more</p><p>vegetables with breakfast which is kind</p><p>of hard because it seems like tomatoes</p><p>and onions are the ones that I usually</p><p>go with and those are higher in carbs so</p><p>it&rsquo;s been vs. has been interesting I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been baking kale and putting it into my</p><p>scrambled eggs more but it&rsquo;s definitely</p><p>been a challenge to find vegetables and</p><p>put it into my breakfasts that aren&rsquo;t</p><p>high in heart yeah it really is I&rsquo;ll</p><p>probably do a kale shake usually and</p><p>then what about for dinner what would</p><p>you have dinner my go-to is mashed</p><p>cauliflower with butter and cream I love</p><p>that and salad a lot of taco salad so</p><p>that just romaine lettuce with hamburger</p><p>meat and wok and usually just a little</p><p>bit of salsa and or I&rsquo;ll do a Cobb salad</p><p>salads are awesome for me and once I</p><p>started a cute ketogenic diet my palate</p><p>became very just wanted really simple</p><p>things so it&rsquo;s been really easy just to</p><p>buy like maybe ten staples every time</p><p>every week and then just use them I just</p><p>think about what I was going to eat all</p><p>the time or where I was going to go or</p><p>and it was always like Chinese or pasta</p><p>or something high in sugar carbs and now</p><p>I just eat whatever at there have been</p><p>opportunities where we could go out to</p><p>eat multiple times and I could pick</p><p>anywhere and I&rsquo;m like I want to eat at</p><p>home I don&rsquo;t want to eat anywhere</p><p>because I just love an avocado just</p><p>playing with some salt and a spoon it&rsquo;s</p><p>like one of my favorite things ever so</p><p>it sounds to me like you&rsquo;re gravitating</p><p>to healthier foods like your body is</p><p>like creating health to</p><p>great and I never thought that that</p><p>could be possible it&rsquo;s just you I don&rsquo;t</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s something that you don&rsquo;t</p><p>understand until you feel it because</p><p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s amazing how I just don&rsquo;t</p><p>crave anything anymore especially I used</p><p>to be addicted to Sour Patch Kids and</p><p>Diet Coke like those are many things</p><p>that I just and I wouldn&rsquo;t touch either</p><p>one of those now or when my boyfriend</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t do the ketogenic diet all the</p><p>time he definitely is opening his eyes</p><p>but when he orders pizza I like a Friday</p><p>night I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with</p><p>it and I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t even feel a fight</p><p>because it was in myself because I loved</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to knock myself out of</p><p>ketosis after all work that I&rsquo;ve written</p><p>that I&rsquo;ve put into it and then I just</p><p>love the mental clarity so that&rsquo;s so</p><p>awesome I mean it seems to me like if</p><p>you were to summarize it up here you&rsquo;re</p><p>just you&rsquo;re more control of what goes</p><p>into your body you&rsquo;re eating for health</p><p>you who&rsquo;s not controlling you anymore</p><p>great if someone craves the sour patch</p><p>kids or a lemon that&rsquo;s usually a choline</p><p>deficiency and choline is the key</p><p>mineral B vitamin to help you with a</p><p>fatty liver so it&rsquo;s interesting and</p><p>believe it or not egg yolks are loaded</p><p>with choline so you would think that</p><p>that would be the opposite but now it</p><p>isn&rsquo;t but yeah choline if you if you if</p><p>you actually get the supplement : and</p><p>suck on them they taste</p><p>lemony sour and lemony and if you take</p><p>some of that like some like sour candy</p><p>they&rsquo;ll just like eat does like candy</p><p>that&rsquo;s just a vitamin it&rsquo;s choline so</p><p>just a side note yeah and the other</p><p>thing is that I think that when you</p><p>start to do a ketogenic diet and doing</p><p>it a minute fasting people generally</p><p>need more dietary fat because they they</p><p>have a blood sugar issue and they can&rsquo;t</p><p>go from one meal to the next so they&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have to increase the fat to</p><p>sustain them and then when you actually</p><p>get it adapt to ketosis you&rsquo;re burning</p><p>your own fat which you don&rsquo;t need to add</p><p>as much and you can just go</p><p>longer because you can switch to your</p><p>own fat a lot faster as your meal</p><p>awesome yeah that&rsquo;s awesome so I just I</p><p>just want to say thank you for doing</p><p>this this interview I think it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to give a lot of people just motivation</p><p>to think they can do it too especially</p><p>from where you came from</p><p>I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s doable and all these extra</p><p>benefits I mean I don&rsquo;t know why someone</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to jump on that and start</p><p>doing it you know do you you find</p><p>friends or family are like looking at</p><p>you like what are you doing and big and</p><p>interested or what what happens with</p><p>that right definitely my best friend is</p><p>she is kind she started trying to ease</p><p>her way into it slowly and it was funny</p><p>because when I started the ketogenic</p><p>that my boyfriend was kind of like um</p><p>what do you doing</p><p>of kind of freaking out about all the</p><p>fat that I was buying and everything and</p><p>I was like just give me a month I was</p><p>like just let me like don&rsquo;t tell me how</p><p>you feel about this don&rsquo;t knock me off</p><p>track just give me a month and I</p><p>remember I was in the kitchen on a</p><p>Friday night and he was on the other</p><p>side of the apartment and he looked at</p><p>me he&rsquo;s like oh my god he was like you</p><p>were losing so much weight and and at</p><p>the same time I&rsquo;m like eating a thing</p><p>abri you know it&rsquo;s just been so much fun</p><p>it&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s almost like he knows who</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t as bad as what adapting wasn&rsquo;t as</p><p>bad as I had thought and it was so I&rsquo;ve</p><p>you keto it was absolutely amazing</p><p>because the transition was really easy</p><p>and my cravings went away really fast</p><p>and my family has been kind of so I&rsquo;ve</p><p>always been dieting my whole life so to</p><p>them this is probably like oh she&rsquo;s</p><p>doing another one of these things so I</p><p>this one I&rsquo;ve been kind of I haven&rsquo;t</p><p>felt the need to like preach about it</p><p>like I had before and I think it&rsquo;s</p><p>because I&rsquo;m more secure in it I&rsquo;m just</p><p>like whatever so I&rsquo;m just quieter about</p><p>it because it&rsquo;s more fun kind of to</p><p>change quietly for me and I notice that</p><p>people are kind of turned off by because</p><p>they just don&rsquo;t understand the science</p><p>behind it so they think that it&rsquo;s just</p><p>this crazy thing that you&rsquo;re doing so</p><p>I don&rsquo;t I feel really bad when I see</p><p>people in the morning like how I would</p><p>well I would do the same thing I would</p><p>make like a fruit a fruit smoothie with</p><p>like a banana and like a strawberry and</p><p>I would end up like washing down</p><p>breakfast with it instead of it being my</p><p>breakfast and I could never understand</p><p>why and just the science behind it all</p><p>it makes complete sense and I I don&rsquo;t</p><p>crave the way that I used to or I used</p><p>to eat a giant meal and then I want ice</p><p>cream and cookies and I wouldn&rsquo;t even I</p><p>would never I couldn&rsquo;t understand it it</p><p>just didn&rsquo;t make sense and now it makes</p><p>complete sense to me and I that&rsquo;s what</p><p>helps keep me away from sugars I don&rsquo;t</p><p>ever want to feel that way ever again</p><p>because it was just it so it&rsquo;s like this</p><p>blind hunger that you just don&rsquo;t get no</p><p>matter you don&rsquo;t understand no matter</p><p>how much you eat you can still be hungry</p><p>it was just it was amazing</p><p>that&rsquo;s some good advice for some people</p><p>that been overweight their whole life</p><p>and they&rsquo;ve dieted so many times in</p><p>their menopausal I will tell them to do</p><p>this but then to shoot for just one meal</p><p>a day just because they&rsquo;re like the</p><p>thyroids so weak and they&rsquo;re going to</p><p>need they can&rsquo;t I mean they just</p><p>couldn&rsquo;t they can actually be so</p><p>efficient on small amount of calories so</p><p>so I do put a series of you know a</p><p>handful of people on one meal a day and</p><p>day basically thrive they do great and</p><p>they get their body back but that&rsquo;s one</p><p>thing you could do if you actually do</p><p>not have any more metabolism you tried</p><p>everything and nothing&rsquo;s work you want</p><p>to start three meals no snacks two meals</p><p>no snacks two meals within a four-hour</p><p>window and then eventually one meal over</p><p>a period of months and then that will</p><p>work for them so for those of you</p><p>watching you might want to try that well</p><p>thank you so much for doing this and I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an amazing</p><p>transformation and we&rsquo;ll have to do none</p><p>of one another one of these maybe in</p><p>like several months from now just kind</p><p>of see the changes until you&rsquo;re totally</p><p>100 percent satisfied with like okay I</p><p>hit my ultimate goal right and it&rsquo;s</p><p>awesome because I before I was in a</p><p>hurry to get to my goal and of course I</p><p>want to stay focused doing this but I</p><p>not I think people are in a hurry</p><p>sometimes because it&rsquo;s either one or the</p><p>other it&rsquo;s like if this is not working</p><p>for me right now I&rsquo;m going to go eat my</p><p>starfish kids and drink my diet coke and</p><p>I just feel like this is the most study</p><p>thing that I&rsquo;ve done where I just feel</p><p>confident in what I&rsquo;m doing and I feel</p><p>great along the way that if it happens</p><p>to be a year and a half instead of six</p><p>months which it shouldn&rsquo;t be but if it</p><p>does um then I&rsquo;m okay with it because</p><p>it&rsquo;s I know I&rsquo;m going to feel great</p><p>mentally the whole the whole time so</p><p>it&rsquo;s not like a one or the other kind of</p><p>thing anymore right yeah you&rsquo;re not</p><p>suffering you&rsquo;re great you&rsquo;re enjoying</p><p>it and it&rsquo;s not hard so that&rsquo;s awesome I</p><p>feel I feel for these people that are</p><p>struggling trying to diet and they don&rsquo;t</p><p>have a clue they&rsquo;re eating the small</p><p>month but they&rsquo;re still eating carbs and</p><p>I&rsquo;m like oh my gosh I don&rsquo;t know how</p><p>they do it that&rsquo;s rough I think they</p><p>must be starving all the time hmm</p><p>starving and oh my it&rsquo;s just torture so</p><p>right well thank you so much I</p><p>appreciated you your time and I think we</p><p>have a great interaction so all right</p><p>we&rsquo;ll have a nice day and I&rsquo;ll talk to</p><p>you soon okay okay bye bye</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a
