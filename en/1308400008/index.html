    <p>Hi friends, so in this episode I&rsquo;m gonna get real vulnerable and I have to to</p>
<p>prove my point and one thing about me is I&rsquo;m gonna prove my motherfucking point</p>
<p>no matter what I have to do so in this one I gotta expose some things about</p>
<p>myself and I do want to say if there is one episode of my podcast that you</p>
<p>listen to fully I hope it&rsquo;s this one because I&rsquo;m gonna share some awareness</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve gained that I think could benefit every single human being in</p>
<p>existence I don&rsquo;t mean to toot my own horn but this is a fucking good</p>
<p>realization I had another thing I&rsquo;m excited to share is my fucking app is</p>
<p>live it&rsquo;s finished all the updates are done the journal prompts are ready for</p>
<p>you to use them go do that shadow work bitch if you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about I have an app it&rsquo;s called positive focus it was just positive notifications</p>
<p>like to your phone to shift your focus like haha you get the name positive</p>
<p>focus but I just added a whole section of like shadow work prompts and like</p>
<p>journaling prompts basically it&rsquo;s just questions to ask yourself so you can</p>
<p>gain awareness and figure yourself out so if you want to check that out which I</p>
<p>really hope you do I will put the link in the description of this podcast but</p>
<p>also you can just go in the App Store and type in positive focus and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>blue one with the eyeball so if you do check it out let me know what you think</p>
<p>I really want to know how you feel about it and I hope it helps you so at</p>
<p>the basic level this episode is gonna be about why you need to express the way</p>
<p>that you feel like the actual way that you feel good or bad why you need to</p>
<p>tell people and why you&rsquo;re a fucking asshole if you don&rsquo;t but we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to circle back to that as like in business terms circle back I make</p>
<p>myself laugh at the stupidest fucking shit so my entire life I have felt not</p>
<p>considered by people by friends by parents but people in relationships I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been in literally I&rsquo;ve I never feel considered I never feel like my feelings</p>
<p>matter people have always just treated me like I don&rsquo;t have feelings and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just supposed to be okay with shit and my entire childhood I was bullied really</p>
<p>bad like in an unrealistic way like it was fucking excessive the shit that</p>
<p>people would say and do to me you know as long as I can remember people have</p>
<p>fucking hated me people have treated me unfairly and treated me like I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have feelings and like I didn&rsquo;t matter like I was never considered I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>felt like a human being to other people I feel like this exception and this like</p>
<p>just fucking thing that people just disregard I&rsquo;m just supposed to have</p>
<p>everything figured the fuck out that&rsquo;s it like that&rsquo;s basically it and I know I</p>
<p>sound like a whiny fucking bitch like I sound like a victim a little but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the truth it&rsquo;s how I fucking feel and I&rsquo;m gonna take responsibility for my</p>
<p>contribution of that but just shut up and listen okay cuz we&rsquo;re gonna get to</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t throw judgments yet this is a safe space I&rsquo;m expressing how I feel</p>
<p>another thing is people have just always seemed to expect me to be okay with shit</p>
<p>that they would not be okay with like it&rsquo;s all fun and games when I&rsquo;m the one</p>
<p>getting hurt or I&rsquo;m the one having to deal with something but as soon as it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>flipped and they&rsquo;re the one having to go through it oh no then I&rsquo;m the fucking</p>
<p>asshole then I&rsquo;m the heartless one then I&rsquo;m the like the bad guy what that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking understand I&rsquo;ve always been the outcast I&rsquo;ve never felt like I</p>
<p>belonged I&rsquo;ve never felt someone&rsquo;s favorite someone has always liked</p>
<p>someone more than me and when I say everyone I say everyone for a reason</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been someone&rsquo;s number one I&rsquo;ve never been someone&rsquo;s best friend</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been like the closest person to someone and that&rsquo;ll fuck you up hi you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t turn out like me because you had a good fucking easy life you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the awareness that I have at 23 because you had a good fucking life take that in</p>
<p>for a second so with not feeling considered I went into that and I tried</p>
<p>to see where I was contributing you know like what the fuck is in my control that</p>
<p>will help me be considered and bitch when I tell you I open up a can of worms</p>
<p>I was not ready for because the way that I have been treated is partly my</p>
<p>fault because I act like everything&rsquo;s fine I act like I have everything under</p>
<p>control I act like things don&rsquo;t bother me so the way that people have treated</p>
<p>me for so long it&rsquo;s kind of because I allow it I make it seem like that so I</p>
<p>basically realized I&rsquo;m a fucking asshole because I don&rsquo;t tell people the way I</p>
<p>actually feel like I will just let things happen and not express the true</p>
<p>way I feel about it like if something small happens I&rsquo;ll just let it go and</p>
<p>build resentment silently which is so fucking bad and so detrimental to any</p>
<p>relationship you could have like that&rsquo;s the worst thing you can fucking do and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over here doing it so I realized in order for me to be considered I have to</p>
<p>present myself fully to people if someone does not know I&rsquo;m upset how the</p>
<p>fuck are they gonna know to comfort me if someone doesn&rsquo;t know that something</p>
<p>bothers me how are they supposed to know to change it if I act like I&rsquo;m okay with</p>
<p>it how the fuck are they supposed to know to change it that&rsquo;s not fair I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been putting people in an unfair position for a very long time yes we can</p>
<p>get into the why the why is because every time I&rsquo;ve expressed how I felt</p>
<p>growing up it was met with you&rsquo;re annoying shut the fuck up why are you</p>
<p>complaining how ungrateful are you that you&rsquo;re fucking sad right now how dare</p>
<p>you be sad how dare you feel anything other than fucking happy anything I said</p>
<p>about the way that I felt was complaining it was bitching it was</p>
<p>whining it was annoying I was a nuisance and I was not accommodated so when I</p>
<p>felt distress and I said it I was on my own to deal with it and I was told that</p>
<p>I was fucking annoying so what is a child gonna do when you respond to it</p>
<p>like that it&rsquo;s gonna shut the fuck up it&rsquo;s gonna stop talking you&rsquo;re never</p>
<p>gonna know how that child feels because all you ever did was criticize it so the</p>
<p>way that I am is totally understandable and I understand it no shit because I</p>
<p>went through it but I have the compassion for myself to understand how</p>
<p>I got to the place that I&rsquo;m at and why for so long it served me not to talk</p>
<p>about the way that I felt because it caused me more pain so if I&rsquo;m already in</p>
<p>pain and I express to anyone around me hey I don&rsquo;t feel good I&rsquo;m in pain this</p>
<p>hurt me this whatever I&rsquo;m not okay with this and their reaction caused me more</p>
<p>pain it&rsquo;s safer to just shut up it&rsquo;s less pain like to just shut up and deal</p>
<p>with it so what I wanted when I was younger was to avoid being in more pain</p>
<p>okay so not talking about anything allowed me to do that hiding the way I</p>
<p>truly felt allowed me to avoid being in more pain I am no longer in the place</p>
<p>where I was when this was beneficial so mentally I mean but now I want to feel</p>
<p>connected and close to people I want to be considered so given this new desire</p>
<p>that I have I have to change the way that I&rsquo;ve been expressing myself which</p>
<p>is by not by not expressing myself I silently build resentment toward people</p>
<p>like a motherfucker like really bad and I didn&rsquo;t realize how much resentment I</p>
<p>actually hold for so many people over so many little things I don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>explain myself because I do stand up for myself I don&rsquo;t let no fuck shit fly but</p>
<p>there are little things that I let go and I air quote the shit out of let go</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t let them go I just don&rsquo;t voice that they bother me and then</p>
<p>I build resentment over it I need to give you an example so you can like put</p>
<p>this on the terms it&rsquo;s like if you don&rsquo;t want someone to use your hairbrush this</p>
<p>is a stupid fucking example but it will prove the point if I am at my house</p>
<p>getting ready and I have a hairbrush and for whatever reason I don&rsquo;t like anyone</p>
<p>to use it like I just I have it for myself and that&rsquo;s it I have a weird</p>
<p>fucking thing I don&rsquo;t want anyone to use my hairbrush and my friend comes</p>
<p>over and asks oh my god can I use that hairbrush real quick before we go out</p>
<p>the old me would have just given them the hairbrush and pretended it was okay</p>
<p>I would just pretend I was fine with it and let them have it they would use it</p>
<p>and it would be fine and I would be pissed the fuck off inside so my friend</p>
<p>is gonna see nothing wrong with it because I pretended like I was okay with</p>
<p>it so next time we get ready to go out she might ask to use the hairbrush again</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in my head gonna be like alright bitch I let you fucking use it once not</p>
<p>quit asking but I never expressed that but I&rsquo;m gonna pretend to be okay with it</p>
<p>again so I&rsquo;m gonna be like yeah fine use the hairbrush it&rsquo;s okay so I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna for the second time I&rsquo;m gonna pretend like it&rsquo;s fine and I&rsquo;m gonna let</p>
<p>my friend use the hairbrush my friend thinks everything&rsquo;s okay I&rsquo;m secretly</p>
<p>building resentment like why the fuck are you still asking to use my hairbrush</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s gonna happen a third time it&rsquo;s gonna happen a fourth time a fifth time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna keep going and I&rsquo;m gonna keep building resentment until one day I</p>
<p>fucking pop something&rsquo;s gonna piss me off enough where I pop and I unleash and</p>
<p>all the resentment I&rsquo;ve been secretly building is gonna come out and I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>shame that friend for what the fuck they did and how they didn&rsquo;t just guess the</p>
<p>way that I was feeling it sounds so obvious but this was happening in my</p>
<p>brain for so long and I didn&rsquo;t realize like I was putting people in unfair</p>
<p>transactions they didn&rsquo;t know that they were in it makes sense why I did it it</p>
<p>totally makes sense given my experiences and the way that I learned to handle</p>
<p>things and not express the way that I felt it makes sense but who I am now it</p>
<p>makes no fucking sense like to do that I see how detrimental it is and I see how</p>
<p>damaging that is and I see how you can never truly have a close relationship or</p>
<p>friendship with a person if you&rsquo;re gonna do this but I&rsquo;m gonna feel justified when</p>
<p>I pop on my friend about using my hairbrush when I finally do express that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not comfortable with it it&rsquo;s after I&rsquo;ve already been pushed past the point</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m so fucking mad and I have so much resentment I&rsquo;m ready to cut this</p>
<p>friend off for it like from my that friend&rsquo;s perspective they think nothing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with it they&rsquo;re using the fucking hairbrush how were they supposed to know</p>
<p>I was upset I just pretended to be okay with it every single time so that friend</p>
<p>is gonna be completely blindsided and it&rsquo;s not fair to them what I just did</p>
<p>for so long in my life I felt like I was justified and I felt like people just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get it but like I said awakening and gaining awareness is fucking</p>
<p>uncomfortable and it&rsquo;s painful because now I have to look back on all the</p>
<p>situations where I thought I was justified and see that I was actually a</p>
<p>fucking dick and I was putting people in unfair positions and then like</p>
<p>getting mad at them for it when they didn&rsquo;t guess how I was feeling I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do this anymore so given this analogy with the brush because it&rsquo;s an easy one</p>
<p>say I was the friend that needed the brush if I had a friend that I went to</p>
<p>go use their brush and they were like okay look I know like this is fucking</p>
<p>weird but I don&rsquo;t like people using my brush you can use it this one time but</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m weird about it and just know that them revealing the way that they</p>
<p>feel gives me the full opportunity to accommodate them to find a way for us to</p>
<p>both get what we want you know like if I know something&rsquo;s gonna bother you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna find a way not to do it but I wouldn&rsquo;t know that I needed to</p>
<p>accommodate you or try to change something if you didn&rsquo;t tell me how you</p>
<p>felt so next time I go to this friend&rsquo;s house I&rsquo;ll make sure to bring my own</p>
<p>brush or brush my hair before I leave the fucking house or I would buy a brush</p>
<p>and leave it at their place that I could use you know like there&rsquo;s a way to</p>
<p>accommodate people but you have to express the way that you feel in order</p>
<p>to be accommodated it&rsquo;s so fucking uncomfortable I hate telling people my</p>
<p>little weird quick like kinks and quirks and shit that bothers me because I have</p>
<p>that voice in the back of my head of how I used to be treated of like this is</p>
<p>fucking stupid like the way that you feel is annoying but I have to remind</p>
<p>myself it&rsquo;s not and what I want is to feel considered by people and in order</p>
<p>to meet that goal there&rsquo;s steps that I need to take there&rsquo;s shit that I need to</p>
<p>take responsibility for which is speaking the fuck up which is giving</p>
<p>people the fair chance to know how I feel so that they can choose or not</p>
<p>choose to accommodate that if they care about how I feel they&rsquo;ll do something</p>
<p>different and it&rsquo;s not gonna be in an annoying way because if my friend came</p>
<p>to me like I said with the brush thing I would want to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pissing them off and I wasn&rsquo;t hurting them I would be happy to accommodate</p>
<p>that hiding how you feel about something is not nice it is not considerate like</p>
<p>some people think and I thought for a long time that I was like saving the</p>
<p>other person&rsquo;s feelings like I was choosing to hide how I felt so it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hurt them that&rsquo;s not the fucking case why would that hurt someone growing up</p>
<p>everyone around me took everything fucking personal I felt like I was</p>
<p>hurting people with the way that I felt because they had no fucking emotional</p>
<p>intelligence skills hiding that you&rsquo;re uncomfortable is not sparing anyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>feelings it&rsquo;s just making you suffer in silence like you think you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>justified and like being the good guy by shutting your mouth and just dealing</p>
<p>with something when you&rsquo;re actually fucking any chance at having a good</p>
<p>relationship with this person so there&rsquo;s one more layer with this that I</p>
<p>discovered that I shocked the shit out of myself with the whole building</p>
<p>resentment thing and not expressing the true way that you feel you&rsquo;re suffering</p>
<p>in silence and when you suffer alone it&rsquo;s worse human beings when you suffer</p>
<p>together you suffer less so that&rsquo;s just a little fun fact for you to know but</p>
<p>when you hold in emotions emotions are energy if you hold in emotions and do</p>
<p>not express them they will rot your body I personally have experienced this I am</p>
<p>not gonna get into like personal detail the number one cause of acne that people</p>
<p>do not fucking understand is pent up emotions you are not letting things out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in your internal world is also gonna reflect on your external</p>
<p>world if you have pent up emotions that you are not letting out that is energy</p>
<p>that is trapped in you it is gonna express itself so acne what is acne it</p>
<p>is a little ball of pus that builds until it expresses out of your skin</p>
<p>those pent-up emotions you&rsquo;re holding in are the true cause behind your fucking</p>
<p>acne because someone like me I have used every fucking face scrub every</p>
<p>anything you can think to clear your skin up I have tried it and sometimes</p>
<p>acne just doesn&rsquo;t fucking go away because there is an emotional cause</p>
<p>behind it I&rsquo;m a big believer in that like it makes so much sense it makes so</p>
<p>much fucking sense with your body and since I&rsquo;ve started expressing the way</p>
<p>that I feel truly like if something frustrates me expressing it and not</p>
<p>letting it build to resentment because resentment is not something you just get</p>
<p>it comes from repeatedly being pissed off and not expressing it or saying</p>
<p>anything about it you know like that&rsquo;s resentment is just unresolved shit</p>
<p>happening over and over and you just hold it in and I experienced this</p>
<p>firsthand because like I said since I started expressing my emotions my acne</p>
<p>has cleared up and I&rsquo;m talking in a matter of like days it&rsquo;s fucking weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like magic because if what&rsquo;s causing my acne is the emotions that are</p>
<p>building up as I express them verbally and get them out of me and feel them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer trapped needing to come out of my skin and this goes for acne</p>
<p>anywhere like body acne face acne any kind of acne you got any kind of like</p>
<p>cyst boil anything that has like a build-up and an express look at that</p>
<p>look at what you&rsquo;re holding in and look at what you need to express because your</p>
<p>body is trying to talk to you your body is trying to tell you to let it out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening internally is reflecting externally so pay the fuck</p>
<p>attention you can shut out your internal world you can stop paying</p>
<p>attention to it but you can&rsquo;t ignore the physical you can&rsquo;t ignore your external</p>
<p>world and that&rsquo;s the way that your internal world is gonna communicate with</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s a mirror I don&rsquo;t know how spiritual y&rsquo;all get but I believe in</p>
<p>this shit I&rsquo;m now living proof of it so if you&rsquo;re someone like me that just</p>
<p>hides the way that they feel and has hid the way that you feel for most of your</p>
<p>fucking life it&rsquo;s gonna be scary to start trying to express the way that you</p>
<p>actually feel it&rsquo;s gonna be scary to show people the real you and hope that</p>
<p>they can handle it and hope that they&rsquo;re nice and accommodating and care but I do</p>
<p>want to say that you will be shocked at how well people receive it and how</p>
<p>people actually do care how you feel because just flip it if you are with</p>
<p>your friend and they do something or say something that hurts you or bothers</p>
<p>you flip it in your head be like if I said something to my friend or did</p>
<p>something that bothered them would I want to know what I want them to tell me</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna make you see that yes you owe that to them like any</p>
<p>relationship you have is like an unknown commitment to communicate especially a</p>
<p>romantic relationship when you commit to monogamy you commit to communication but</p>
<p>also you commit to communication kind of when you have any kind of relationship</p>
<p>like a friendship a partner a parent a child co-worker any relationship you</p>
<p>need communication and if you don&rsquo;t communicate you&rsquo;re fucked because like I</p>
<p>said if you&rsquo;re pushed to the point where you&rsquo;re like I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if this</p>
<p>hurts the other person I&rsquo;m letting it out when you get to that level it takes</p>
<p>you there to express it that&rsquo;s not fair like I said and after you pop on that</p>
<p>person you&rsquo;re done because the trust is gone this person will never feel safe</p>
<p>with you again because they know that you&rsquo;re just gonna let shit like seem</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s okay and you&rsquo;re really gonna be building resentment you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>liar like I hate to say it but I was the same way I was a fucking liar for a long</p>
<p>time and I still be hiding the way I feel but this person is not gonna trust</p>
<p>you they will never feel comfortable around you and why would they because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna pretend like shit&rsquo;s okay and then freak out on them again later</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re gonna be walking on eggshells the entire time they&rsquo;re around you are</p>
<p>you actually okay with shit are you not they&rsquo;re gonna be left guessing and that</p>
<p>is the most draining thing to do that&rsquo;s the worst position to be in is to try to</p>
<p>have to guess how people truly feel if they just pretend they&rsquo;re okay with</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a red fucking flag if someone pretends they&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>with everything and they never really talk about anything bad don&rsquo;t trust that</p>
<p>motherfucker and I&rsquo;m not saying only express things that are bad if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna express the way you feel you need to express everything you need to</p>
<p>express when you&rsquo;re happy too you need to express all the good feeling things</p>
<p>and the things that you do appreciate so that the people around you feel safe</p>
<p>because if you will express when things bother you people know that they can</p>
<p>trust when you say you like something they feel safe they don&rsquo;t have to guess</p>
<p>what boundaries they&rsquo;re accidentally stepping on because you won&rsquo;t speak the</p>
<p>fuck up it&rsquo;s so much better and it feels so much better to be around people that</p>
<p>will voice when they&rsquo;re upset by something because you know when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy they&rsquo;re actually happy because I know we&rsquo;ve all experienced being next to</p>
<p>someone and you know they&rsquo;re fucking pissed off but they&rsquo;re pretending they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fine and you&rsquo;re sitting there trying to guess what could have caused it how to</p>
<p>fix it what&rsquo;s really going on and there&rsquo;s that frustration you feel I hate</p>
<p>that I fucking hate that so I&rsquo;m done being that to other people and like I</p>
<p>said if you express things when they&rsquo;re small it&rsquo;s not gonna turn into a fucking</p>
<p>fight and that&rsquo;s one other thing is anytime when I was little I would</p>
<p>express how I felt it was a fight it was an argument like it was a full-fledged</p>
<p>like knockdown drag out fucking screaming match anytime you would</p>
<p>express the way that you felt so of course if you&rsquo;re in the same boat of</p>
<p>course you&rsquo;re scared to talk about the way that you feel you think that people</p>
<p>are gonna fight you on it you think it&rsquo;s gonna become a big fucking deal so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh I&rsquo;ll just I just rather not deal with it but by not expressing the</p>
<p>way that you feel you&rsquo;re gonna miss out on the people that care how you feel</p>
<p>because any of my friends that are listening to this right now I care how</p>
<p>you feel if something bothers you I want you to come to me I will never look at</p>
<p>the way that you feel and tell you you&rsquo;re fucking stupid I will never tell</p>
<p>you that you&rsquo;re annoying I will never act like you&rsquo;re just complaining and</p>
<p>that the way that you feel is inconvenient I&rsquo;m gonna listen I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>try to understand why you&rsquo;re feeling the way that you feel it&rsquo;s important to me I</p>
<p>want you to feel safe with me I want you to feel cared about I don&rsquo;t care how</p>
<p>stupid it fucking sounds like the hairbrush thing if you have something</p>
<p>that does not make sense I still want to know I want to know how you feel I care</p>
<p>and if my friends just decide to never express that they&rsquo;re gonna miss out on</p>
<p>me being there for them they&rsquo;re gonna miss out on someone being there to</p>
<p>consider them and when I realized all this I realized it with myself too like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing out on the people that would actually be there for me by shutting my</p>
<p>mouth so if I want to be considered and I want to feel cared about I have to</p>
<p>speak the fuck up I have to face that and for the people that are inspired now</p>
<p>to talk about the way that they feel bitch I&rsquo;m in the same boat it&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an everyday commitment and a choice that you have to make to continue to do</p>
<p>this but hiding the way that you feel and suffering and silence is not</p>
<p>virtuous it&rsquo;s not good and it&rsquo;s not actually protecting you I know it feels</p>
<p>like it is but it&rsquo;s not and I&rsquo;m speaking to myself when I say that too as I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>speaking to you I do want to say I don&rsquo;t care what religion you&rsquo;re from I</p>
<p>just have one message you were not sent to this life to suffer I don&rsquo;t care what</p>
<p>way you want to cut it I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if you believe in karma or not you</p>
<p>were not sent to this life to suffer one other thing I want to point out is the</p>
<p>way that you&rsquo;re feeling might also just be because of the way that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at something you might be assuming something is the way that it is</p>
<p>and by talking to someone you&rsquo;ll see that it actually isn&rsquo;t like that so that</p>
<p>will take away the feeling that you&rsquo;re feeling like last night I have to use an</p>
<p>example from my own life and I really hope that my friends are okay with this</p>
<p>but it explains this perfectly so last night me and two of my girlfriends were</p>
<p>at a club and we were dancing and I was dancing with one girl more than the</p>
<p>other because we was getting freaky we was like dancing like we was fucking you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m gay but I very much still like affection I like to make out with girls</p>
<p>I like to have fun like a dance I like to do all the fun stuff so we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>going at it having a good time and me and my other friend have like a tighter</p>
<p>bond where we&rsquo;re more like platonic we&rsquo;ve never kissed we never we just we</p>
<p>respect each other&rsquo;s like boundaries on that and I love our relationship but we</p>
<p>were all three together and we looked like a damn throuple because the other</p>
<p>two were like hanging out and like kiki as like the girls do you know but the</p>
<p>one girl was feeling alone and like left out which is totally understandable and</p>
<p>she was kind of like dancing on her own and doing her thing and like dancing</p>
<p>with other other people around us and she was like upset she was like getting</p>
<p>mad that we were like leaving her out and not really paying attention to her</p>
<p>so it started getting to the point like it was building in her and she got to</p>
<p>the point where she was like fuck this I&rsquo;m leaving and like wanted to leave so</p>
<p>we left and after talking about it the entire time that me and the other girl</p>
<p>were dancing together was because we thought that the our other friend knew</p>
<p>the people she was dancing with like she&rsquo;s a very independent girl but we</p>
<p>thought that she knew the people she was dancing with like so we were letting her</p>
<p>do her thing so the entire time she thought we were leaving her out and we</p>
<p>thought she was with people that she knew so we were letting her hang out</p>
<p>with them and we were just like like deal like hanging out with ourselves does</p>
<p>that make sense if she never told us she felt left out she would have thought we</p>
<p>were just intentionally ignoring her because her coming to us and saying this</p>
<p>is the way that I felt because of the way that she was seeing the experience</p>
<p>we were able to offer insight of what we were experiencing which showed it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that at all which made us all feel better when you let people in on the way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re feeling they could potentially offer you an answer that</p>
<p>will make your suffering end because she thought we were intentionally ignoring</p>
<p>ignoring her and just like doing our own thing and excluding her when that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the case so when we finally talked about it everything was resolved like our</p>
<p>intention was not what she thought it was so it didn&rsquo;t hurt her the way it did</p>
<p>I hope this is making sense because I think that&rsquo;s a really good example to</p>
<p>use to explain what I&rsquo;m talking about basically my point in all this is speak</p>
<p>up express how you feel I promise it will help you more than it hurts you</p>
<p>even if you gotta get into a few fucking fights and it&rsquo;s got to show you some</p>
<p>people that you can&rsquo;t go to then so be it just because one person responds</p>
<p>negatively to you and the way that you feel doesn&rsquo;t mean that everybody will</p>
<p>and my final thought I need to add is a lot of people think that expressing your</p>
<p>emotions is pussy like it&rsquo;s weak and it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s actually so much harder</p>
<p>and take so much more strength to voice the way that you feel and face people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>reactions and consequences if there is any than it is to just shut up and</p>
<p>suffer alone because for me to shut up and just handle things on my own that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m used to that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m good at I know how to do that that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>easy-peasy people think I&rsquo;m courageous because I shut the fuck up and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>express the way that I feel oh I&rsquo;m tough stuff because I don&rsquo;t have feelings I am</p>
<p>a fucking walking robot I don&rsquo;t have feelings fuck those I&rsquo;m not a fucking</p>
<p>pussy no bitch that&rsquo;s the easy way out the actual thing that takes strength is</p>
<p>to voice how you feel so if somebody wants to come at you and say that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being a fucking bitch or you&rsquo;re weak for expressing that you&rsquo;re upset let them</p>
<p>listen to this podcast and tell them to shut the fuck up while you&rsquo;re at it I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want no one being mean to my followers like I&rsquo;m so protective anyone</p>
<p>that likes me I have like this weird protection over you guys I&rsquo;m a very</p>
<p>protective person but now that I know you guys like me oh my god I&rsquo;ve seen a</p>
<p>couple you guys at the bar and like I&rsquo;m always like watching you after you come</p>
<p>up to me and you introduce yourself to me I&rsquo;m watching out for you because if</p>
<p>you get in a fight bitch I&rsquo;m right there I&rsquo;m Albanian that&rsquo;s how we are but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like watching out for you once I know that we&rsquo;re like cool and you like</p>
<p>follow me you know but yeah just let these closed off unable to express</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re feeling motherfuckers that think it&rsquo;s weak let them listen to this</p>
