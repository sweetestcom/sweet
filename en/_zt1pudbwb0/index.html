just just</p><p>jump right in and share your history of</p><p>I saw the before pictures I want to know</p><p>like how long ago was that and what</p><p>actually happened well a little bit long</p><p>story we&rsquo;ll make it as short as possible</p><p>that I was always thin as a kid and even</p><p>after having four children remained size</p><p>six probably at my biggest and about ten</p><p>years ago I moved to Indiana from</p><p>Kentucky and got into a little bit of a</p><p>situation where I get depressed and I</p><p>got very stressed and weight just</p><p>started packing it on it was a big</p><p>surprise to me one of those things where</p><p>you know you don&rsquo;t notice you&rsquo;re getting</p><p>big or at least I was kind of thankful</p><p>that when I looked at myself in the</p><p>mirror I didn&rsquo;t see what was actually</p><p>there because that would have beaten me</p><p>even more depressed I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s</p><p>just a big a big weight gain over over</p><p>eight to ten year period for no reason</p><p>but stress it may have been a little</p><p>diet but my diet really didn&rsquo;t change no</p><p>after having four kids being a size six</p><p>you know I was a little more active but</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t think it make that big of a</p><p>difference maybe my metabolism after</p><p>turning 40 some 45 now so I&rsquo;m really</p><p>still not sure what caused the weight to</p><p>pack on except for maybe stress and</p><p>depression</p><p>what toe what was your age at that time</p><p>where you you started just like you&rsquo;ve</p><p>gained a lot of weight</p><p>38 38 okay so you went through all this</p><p>stress were you sleeping at the time or</p><p>now did you say sleeping yeah now my</p><p>sleep has always been a problem it&rsquo;s</p><p>really interesting that you bring that</p><p>up you know I I work a night shift job</p><p>currently and sleep is still in she get</p><p>six to eight hours but I&rsquo;m lucky</p><p>sometimes I&rsquo;ll work two jobs when I call</p><p>me into my other place of employment and</p><p>I&rsquo;ll get four or five and that&rsquo;s like a</p><p>collective sleep so the things I do need</p><p>to work on is my sleep so I always hear</p><p>I hear you in the back of my head you</p><p>know recovery recovery and burning</p><p>things and sleep and right yeah that&rsquo;s a</p><p>struggle from you probably saw the</p><p>adrenal body type video where I talk</p><p>about stress being like something I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s kind of a ignored area with</p><p>weight gain but it&rsquo;s very common did you</p><p>see that video that I had on the</p><p>adrenals I did yeah that&rsquo;s probably your</p><p>video for you because he the stress can</p><p>activate a hormone called cortisol did</p><p>you did you gain weight all over was it</p><p>mainly in the midsection it was kind of</p><p>all over yeah you see in my pictures I</p><p>have a lot of face fat arm fat you know</p><p>my shoes even fit better when I started</p><p>keto I started losing weight you know on</p><p>my rings I had to actually take off and</p><p>put on a key ring because they wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>fit my fingers so amazing it was all wow</p><p>yeah cuz it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p><p>amazing how because I saw you before</p><p>picture and then the after it was like</p><p>before during and after</p><p>what was your peak weight that you hit</p><p>that your maximum weight that you&rsquo;re</p><p>weighing your worth oh I kind of stopped</p><p>looking about 220 hmm and I stopped</p><p>taking pictures</p><p>probably well before that it was just by</p><p>chance I found a couple that were at my</p><p>peak rate but I&rsquo;m guessing it had to be</p><p>at least 230 Wow I honestly didn&rsquo;t want</p><p>to step on a scale it didn&rsquo;t want to be</p><p>in front of a mirror I definitely didn&rsquo;t</p><p>want to take photos and it just got</p><p>really bad so those pictures that you</p><p>see the majority of them that the</p><p>heavier weight was a year ago possibly</p><p>two years ago and but the comparison of</p><p>the weight loss that that happened with</p><p>in the first three and a half to four</p><p>months being on keto Wow that&rsquo;s amazing</p><p>what what prompted you to or motivated</p><p>you just say you know what I got to find</p><p>a solution here oh I think I faced</p><p>reality and realized that</p><p>you know I am big and what in the world</p><p>happened it&rsquo;s like I woke up literally</p><p>you know woke up one day I&rsquo;m like this</p><p>just can&rsquo;t happen I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t allow</p><p>myself to go out like this</p><p>and I guess a bigger motivator is I am</p><p>raising my four-year-old severely</p><p>autistic granddaughter</p><p>I&rsquo;m completely nonverbal and totally</p><p>depends on me 100% stressing me and my</p><p>husband but you know when I would change</p><p>her diaper and I struggled to get on the</p><p>floor just with my belly being in the</p><p>way of my thighs at a 90-degree angle</p><p>that that that wasn&rsquo;t right that that</p><p>really pushed me to if I can&rsquo;t sit on</p><p>the floor properly at a 90 degree angle</p><p>then there&rsquo;s a problem Yeah right so so</p><p>then what did you did you do some</p><p>searches have you gone there no how did</p><p>you find out about Kido</p><p>well it&rsquo;s interesting there was there&rsquo;s</p><p>a guy at work a younger gentleman and</p><p>you know I well</p><p>background a little bit I used to do</p><p>some weight training so fitness</p><p>competitions back in the day messed up</p><p>my knee my meniscus which wasn&rsquo;t new</p><p>severe but you know it was a downward</p><p>spiral of getting out of that kind of</p><p>lifestyle</p><p>hmm and though I saw this guy at work</p><p>and he&rsquo;s young he&rsquo;s lost a lot of weight</p><p>since high school they actually featured</p><p>him in a local newspaper for doing such</p><p>a good job and all these things so I</p><p>just asked him one day was he was on his</p><p>way to the gym and heading out of the</p><p>building and said well you don&rsquo;t how can</p><p>I lose fat what&rsquo;s going on nowadays</p><p>because I&rsquo;m out of the loop you know</p><p>that&rsquo;s been 15 years ago or more and he</p><p>said well just try this keto diet I&rsquo;m</p><p>like what that&rsquo;s what so he said it&rsquo;s</p><p>called ketogenic he sent me a text and</p><p>how to spell it and all this good stuff</p><p>and I started doing searches I found you</p><p>almost instantly and your explanation of</p><p>things and why and how and stuff and in</p><p>this short your short but informational</p><p>videos was very helpful to me because I</p><p>don&rsquo;t have much time so I&rsquo;m like I can</p><p>just scroll through your stuff all day</p><p>long which I have already and I think</p><p>I&rsquo;ve watched every single one of your</p><p>videos and yeah that&rsquo;s how I found it I</p><p>just</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s really interesting he he</p><p>told me about the ketogenic diet and I</p><p>promised you that I probably almost</p><p>stayed up for two days just listening to</p><p>things that everybody has to say</p><p>positive negative</p><p>I started dropped in the negative videos</p><p>almost immediately the the results you</p><p>know that I watched some testimonials</p><p>and these before and afters and it just</p><p>blew me away I couldn&rsquo;t believe that</p><p>that could happen Wow</p><p>Wow yeah it&rsquo;s awesome so you started and</p><p>then you started obviously within</p><p>several months you just started losing</p><p>weight obviously right Oh immediately I</p><p>mean I&rsquo;m not real sure a three of my</p><p>four daughters have currently been on</p><p>keto as well one of them is still on</p><p>keto with me and you know she&rsquo;s thin but</p><p>you know thinner her but she&rsquo;s already</p><p>lost 15 pounds in the past couple months</p><p>and you know she&rsquo;s amazed by it you know</p><p>she really can&rsquo;t tell very well but when</p><p>she tries on clothes she couldn&rsquo;t fit</p><p>before and they&rsquo;re almost loose she&rsquo;s</p><p>like whoa I&rsquo;m like yeah awesome and then</p><p>did you add intermittent fasting with</p><p>ketosis at the same time or which how</p><p>did you do those two well in the</p><p>beginning I was kind of fumbling around</p><p>and still learning I I did the whole</p><p>bacon eggs cheese couple olives that</p><p>kind of thing you know making sure that</p><p>I was getting fat in probably getting a</p><p>little too much fat but still losing</p><p>drastic weight I didn&rsquo;t really start in</p><p>a minute fasting it kind of just</p><p>happened I mean even now I&rsquo;m kind of</p><p>curious as to whether I&rsquo;m really doing</p><p>in a minute fasting I&rsquo;ll eat twice a day</p><p>it&rsquo;s I would like to squeeze that into a</p><p>four hour window or five hour window but</p><p>as it stands I&rsquo;ll eat at 7 p.m. and then</p><p>I&rsquo;ll eat at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p><p>when it&rsquo;s my lunchtime at work and</p><p>usually when I get up I&rsquo;ll do my and my</p><p>butter coffee so I mean I kind of slid</p><p>in passing just because I&rsquo;m not hungry</p><p>you know I guess the fat is such an</p><p>appetite suppressant for me that I just</p><p>I&rsquo;m not</p><p>that&rsquo;s so that&rsquo;s so awesome because I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s probably the number one thing</p><p>with people like they can&rsquo;t really do a</p><p>program because they&rsquo;re always hungry</p><p>and they&rsquo;re always craving so you&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to stick to anything especially if</p><p>it&rsquo;s like Weight Watchers and try to do</p><p>anything long-term</p><p>so yeah I think with everyone I&rsquo;m</p><p>interviewing they say very similar</p><p>things like the hunger goes away it&rsquo;s</p><p>easier to do go from meal to meal and</p><p>then so did you see any other health</p><p>benefits when you started doing this</p><p>well yeah I have severe knee pain I used</p><p>to have neuropathy in my right leg</p><p>pretty severe to the point where I was</p><p>gonna go get scallions and and things to</p><p>figure out what was wrong because it was</p><p>so painful you know it&rsquo;s hard to</p><p>describe we have this numbing thing and</p><p>people are like well if it&rsquo;s numb it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t hurt I&rsquo;m like no it&rsquo;s nom it</p><p>does hurt and I was really concerned</p><p>about circulation and it that that went</p><p>away I totally don&rsquo;t have any more</p><p>neuropathy in my legs my knees don&rsquo;t</p><p>hurt they still pop a bit and I have</p><p>some weakness but I think getting into</p><p>the gym will help me fix that and</p><p>strengthen myself back up Wow</p><p>but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the biggest thing I&rsquo;ve</p><p>noticed the the aches and pains and</p><p>shocks from the neuropathy in my legs</p><p>have gone away wow my media clarity is a</p><p>little bit better I have to admit I&rsquo;d</p><p>suffer from from a TD so I bounced</p><p>around a lot mm-hmm but the clarity is</p><p>better yeah and then do you what about</p><p>how much do you weigh now I am right</p><p>about one seven right 173 175 awesome I</p><p>think I started off right around 2:30</p><p>220 was was the I just continued to get</p><p>bigger after I marched the 220 and I&rsquo;ll</p><p>just chop it up to 230 and it may have</p><p>been more it made me more about don&rsquo;t</p><p>think it was the less that&rsquo;s fantastic</p><p>yeah because I saw also some earlier</p><p>pictures after you have for kids he</p><p>didn&rsquo;t seem to gain any weight there so</p><p>the whole stress thing wow that&rsquo;s just</p><p>really just pushed you over the edge I</p><p>used to</p><p>Jim quite a bit I wasn&rsquo;t Jimmer out</p><p>there for a while when I was you know</p><p>doing the fitness competition I would go</p><p>2 to 3 hours a day 5 a.m. and I loved</p><p>that it was good for me at the time</p><p>right now I haven&rsquo;t even started any any</p><p>workout whatsoever</p><p>this is strictly just just diet and you</p><p>know I was wondering if it&rsquo;s a</p><p>possibility if somebody is actually</p><p>allergic to gluten if the effects show</p><p>up faster within myself because one of</p><p>my my daughters it&rsquo;s a little heavier</p><p>she tried it and she lost but she didn&rsquo;t</p><p>lose near as fast as I did yeah I&rsquo;m</p><p>really really good about watching my</p><p>carbs those hidden sugars the glycemic</p><p>index you know things that our diet</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s keto and I think being</p><p>very mindful and knowledgeable about</p><p>that thanks to you I am able to tweak it</p><p>up you know almost perfect Wow so in</p><p>other words so she might have a gluten</p><p>intolerance so she might squeeze in a</p><p>little bit of gluten here and there well</p><p>I think I had a gluten intolerance and</p><p>that&rsquo;s what helped me lose so quickly</p><p>and she was you know I&rsquo;m one of those</p><p>people if I read the ingredients label</p><p>and it says sugar I&rsquo;m out and I went</p><p>shopping with her one time when I went</p><p>to visit and she&rsquo;s like I was only</p><p>wandering around a sugar I&rsquo;m like is</p><p>that sugar no so I&rsquo;m pretty strict on</p><p>the sugar bit if it says sugar I don&rsquo;t</p><p>care how little it is I usually won&rsquo;t</p><p>take it in and my idea a cheat meal is</p><p>like going somewhere where I know</p><p>there&rsquo;s SG in the food you know so you</p><p>know the glycemic index there on the MSG</p><p>just freaks me out and I&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s too much hey once you once you</p><p>experience it it&rsquo;s like no one has to</p><p>convince you it&rsquo;s a lot easier because</p><p>you know the effects and where other</p><p>people are probably around you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>this you&rsquo;re like yeah no thanks I</p><p>already know what my body needs it&rsquo;s</p><p>kind of like a great experiment and just</p><p>to see what works on your body and</p><p>within like three months you just lost</p><p>some serious weight that&rsquo;s incredible</p><p>pretty much that was insane and and for</p><p>losing that much eating on my skin</p><p>actually</p><p>back and I was listening to some of your</p><p>other interviews about how you know the</p><p>keto diet everybody kept telling me that</p><p>you know that looks like a mother and</p><p>daughter picture it doesn&rsquo;t even look</p><p>like you you look you know ten years</p><p>younger not only did you lose way that</p><p>you lost years and and that was that&rsquo;s</p><p>interesting you know because you see</p><p>other people go through any other</p><p>program and their skin hangs and sags</p><p>and and things like that and I really</p><p>don&rsquo;t see that in myself now I&rsquo;m five</p><p>years old have four children lost almost</p><p>60 pounds and Wow</p><p>you know I&rsquo;m glad you brought that up</p><p>because um I just wanted to tell people</p><p>that when you&rsquo;re doing the combination</p><p>of this you&rsquo;re dropping insulin so</p><p>therefore you&rsquo;re fixing something called</p><p>insulin resistance and that means that</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna start pulling in more</p><p>protein amino acids that are available</p><p>now to make your connective tissue</p><p>tighten up your skin so you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>this flabby skin like a diabetic would</p><p>they have a lot of loose skin not to</p><p>mention in a minute fasting and the</p><p>growth hormone that then helps you tone</p><p>as well</p><p>it&rsquo;s the anti aging and it&rsquo;s also it&rsquo;s</p><p>called a protein sparer so your sparing</p><p>your proteins your retaining protein</p><p>you&rsquo;re not losing protein and that&rsquo;s why</p><p>you can go from meal to meal comfortably</p><p>without losing any muscle mass you</p><p>actually gain muscle mass so I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re a perfect example of</p><p>that what I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;ll just kind of</p><p>point this out as an experiment I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know if you noticed any improvements in</p><p>your your vision but I wanted to say</p><p>that instead of the keto Coffee thing</p><p>what I&rsquo;m doing now in the morning is I&rsquo;m</p><p>doing kind of a kale [ __ ] Kido kale</p><p>shake with I mean just call it a kale</p><p>shake and I add the coconut oil in there</p><p>because you have these phytonutrients</p><p>called xanthine and lutein in the kale</p><p>it&rsquo;s like off-the-charts which basically</p><p>feed the macula and the retina and the</p><p>brain and so I&rsquo;m drinking massive</p><p>amounts of kale in the morning and with</p><p>the coconut which actually help</p><p>to absorb it because those kind of</p><p>nutrients are a fat-soluble they&rsquo;re not</p><p>water-soluble so you need a little fat</p><p>so that&rsquo;s why you need to put like olive</p><p>oil on your salad so I&rsquo;m doing that in</p><p>the morning and nothing else just a kale</p><p>shake and with the coconut oil oh my</p><p>gosh like my vision is like completely</p><p>different so just an idea for those</p><p>people out there that have issues with</p><p>the vision possible macular degeneration</p><p>any problem the retina give it a shot</p><p>for like a week and just see the before</p><p>and after it&rsquo;s quite interesting with my</p><p>glasses on I&rsquo;ve been noticing that</p><p>things are blurry and I&rsquo;m thinking my</p><p>visions getting much worse what&rsquo;s going</p><p>on and seriously just a week ago I</p><p>decided to lift up my glasses and try to</p><p>read something from a distance like I</p><p>usually do now it wasn&rsquo;t clear but it</p><p>was a lot clearer than usual like that</p><p>spider-man effectors in the beginning of</p><p>that movie when he takes off his glasses</p><p>and he can see puts them on in a blurry</p><p>it was literally almost like that so I</p><p>can&rsquo;t wait to get back to the eye doctor</p><p>and see what improvement has happened</p><p>because like I said I was I was very</p><p>nervous that my vision was getting worse</p><p>for some reasons no like people are</p><p>telling me oh it&rsquo;s your sugar levels</p><p>it&rsquo;s this it&rsquo;s you know your blood</p><p>sugars you know like a diabetic and your</p><p>eyes are getting worse and as a matter</p><p>of fact I think it&rsquo;s getting better</p><p>because it&rsquo;s just yeah if I explained</p><p>that properly totally you did and that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m noticing with a lot of</p><p>people because take a look at a diabetic</p><p>what what happens they go blind why</p><p>because the blood Sugar&rsquo;s affect the</p><p>vascular part to the nerves and around</p><p>the retina so this potentially could</p><p>actually I&rsquo;m not saying reverse it but</p><p>it can improve it greatly and so if</p><p>you&rsquo;re a diabetic or pre-diabetic I</p><p>would give it a shot I&rsquo;m speaking in</p><p>nerd there was a couple of questions I</p><p>should have written down but I had</p><p>forgotten but you brought something to</p><p>like I I have spinal stenosis and I saw</p><p>your video recently on spinal stenosis I</p><p>also have had my gallbladder removed</p><p>probably five years ago I&rsquo;m really</p><p>horrible as time lines but I wonder some</p><p>times if I&rsquo;m pulling enough nutrients</p><p>out of my fat or if I&rsquo;m able to do so to</p><p>be able to possibly repair that that</p><p>that nerve column for my spinal stenosis</p><p>so let me just tell people with spinal</p><p>stenosis is is basically it&rsquo;s a</p><p>situation where the spinal column is not</p><p>providing enough space for the spinal</p><p>cord because there&rsquo;s spurring or</p><p>degeneration or calcium buildup so you</p><p>have this you know pain and either in</p><p>your neck or your lower back or your</p><p>mid-back so that&rsquo;s a vitamin k2</p><p>deficiency another fat-soluble vitamin</p><p>just like what I said before the the</p><p>lutein and the xanthine xanthine which</p><p>are basically vital nutrients in the</p><p>kale so vitamin k2 is a fad Seibel</p><p>vitamin in grass-fed animal products and</p><p>dairy it&rsquo;s also in NATO which is if you</p><p>want to do the fermented soy but here&rsquo;s</p><p>the point if you don&rsquo;t have a gall</p><p>bladder if you have a sluggish gall</p><p>bladder you&rsquo;re not gonna have enough of</p><p>bile to pull those things in like you</p><p>did before when you had it so I think</p><p>with you Cheryl</p><p>might be a good idea to even get some</p><p>get the gall bladder formula with some</p><p>purified bile salts just take like one</p><p>your first meal right after the first</p><p>meal that will give you a little that</p><p>will actually substitute some of that</p><p>bile salt to start pulling in the k2</p><p>that then will start removing the soft</p><p>tissue calcium from the joints from the</p><p>spinal column and that way I think that</p><p>would be the best route for you because</p><p>you could take the k2 it may work but</p><p>it&rsquo;s gonna work really good if you have</p><p>bile and you take it at the same time</p><p>things on my Christmas list let&rsquo;s go</p><p>through your store and get your kale</p><p>shake and your wheatgrass and your your</p><p>gallbladder formula and numerous</p><p>different other things I&rsquo;m really</p><p>excited to be able to try them and see</p><p>how that kicks in along with what I</p><p>caught kitto 2.0 you know I haven&rsquo;t went</p><p>to the gym yet and I can&rsquo;t wait to start</p><p>doing the you know twice a week let my</p><p>body recover you know do 20 minutes of</p><p>high interval you know watching you jump</p><p>around on the stumps in your back</p><p>I was great I&rsquo;m not sure if I could do</p><p>that but maybe we&rsquo;ll get there right</p><p>exactly yeah did you see the one where</p><p>I&rsquo;d jump on a 5 foot actually about five</p><p>or six feet up in the air it was</p><p>absolutely insane I was kind of scared</p><p>for you yeah it&rsquo;s just to let people</p><p>know I really didn&rsquo;t jump that high</p><p>I basically stood on that platform and</p><p>jumped backwards and then reverse the</p><p>camera I did and I should have had a</p><p>blooper video because I almost broke my</p><p>neck jumping backwards off of a five and</p><p>a half foot platform well you fooled me</p><p>what&rsquo;s that you fooled me I thought you</p><p>actually went up yeah I know it&rsquo;s like</p><p>it&rsquo;s amazing you just reverse the camera</p><p>but I I was like let me try this thing</p><p>okay get the camera out and I jumped</p><p>backwards and I go what did I just do</p><p>and I just like almost broke my neck so</p><p>anyway it turned out good but I should</p><p>have had the blooper video on that right</p><p>for those of you watching I&rsquo;ll put a</p><p>link down below of that video so you</p><p>could see it but it&rsquo;s a it looks pretty</p><p>real so quick question about basil and</p><p>besides a spice in my foods how can I</p><p>add that in could it be just the green</p><p>refugee my salads yeah you want to add a</p><p>couple things you could do parsley is</p><p>like really good parsley is good</p><p>kale is good put in your salad I don&rsquo;t</p><p>know if you do in the kale shake yet but</p><p>that would be also really good as well</p><p>yeah for sure does that make sense yes</p><p>and as far as building muscle when I get</p><p>back into the gym you know since I used</p><p>to do the fitness competitions and I was</p><p>really lucky and I actually lost my</p><p>cycle because I was at 6% body fat and I</p><p>felt great during that time I want to</p><p>get back into shape I want to put muscle</p><p>back on you know I went through a lot of</p><p>the muscle atrophy I&rsquo;ve got the the</p><p>dimples and the dents and things like</p><p>that I watched some videos of yours on</p><p>how to repair that Celia MS or whatever</p><p>called I forget is there anything</p><p>besides your your videos that you could</p><p>you know currently point out that that</p><p>would help that you know I don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>up my protein too much so I don&rsquo;t want</p><p>to turn into too much sugar you know</p><p>those kinds of things but what&rsquo;s good</p><p>for a building muscle on keto and my</p><p>next to point oh well I think um I just</p><p>released a video today on that in fact</p><p>to build your muscle the it really</p><p>requires all the nutrients especially</p><p>you know vitamin C and vitamin B and</p><p>some protein but the two nutrients that</p><p>are the most deficient after you fix</p><p>your insulin resistance which it sounds</p><p>like you did would be potassium get any</p><p>uh potassium from the greens and then</p><p>number two the trace minerals which is</p><p>kind of hard to find so I would get that</p><p>in a liquid but make sure it&rsquo;s</p><p>plant-based because all those enzymes</p><p>that convert protein into body protein</p><p>tissue muscle collagen joint which some</p><p>people have a problem with requires the</p><p>trace minerals I&rsquo;m talking to like</p><p>selenium iodine chromium so you take</p><p>that your enzymes will finally have</p><p>enough to start to get your protein nice</p><p>and tight and lean and strong I&rsquo;ll give</p><p>you an example let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p><p>deficient in manganese for example</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna have problems with your</p><p>disks you&rsquo;re gonna have a slip disc you</p><p>have a weak joining your back so each</p><p>mineral does a certain thing to a</p><p>certain part of your body so b12 is for</p><p>the blood that&rsquo;s cobalt that&rsquo;s the trace</p><p>mineral cobalt that goes with that so</p><p>the trace minerals in general I think</p><p>will make you have the unfair advantage</p><p>so when you add your exercise that&rsquo;ll be</p><p>awesome now if you get sore after your</p><p>workout d-ribose is is the remedy that I</p><p>recommend to increase recovery that&rsquo;s</p><p>mainly for a muscle though and skeletal</p><p>muscle recovery and cardiovascular</p><p>muscle recovery which you may not have a</p><p>problem with that but if you just want</p><p>to grow muscle how the lean muscle have</p><p>tight skin I would do the trace mineral</p><p>that&rsquo;s like going to be really important</p><p>plus your hair</p><p>your nails and your skin will be like a</p><p>lot different you know underneath the</p><p>chin things will just try to tighten up</p><p>now when I get those right now usually</p><p>doing the like overdoing the pink</p><p>Himalayan salt and I always do my</p><p>asparagus or my spinach or my cabbage</p><p>you know artichokes Brussels sprouts</p><p>things like that and I have make sure I</p><p>have that with every meal or at least</p><p>with dinner and is there is that the</p><p>best way to get in my trace minerals are</p><p>you well you have trace mineral product</p><p>is it correct yeah the problem with the</p><p>vegetables right now but they&rsquo;re growing</p><p>on soils that are devoid of trace</p><p>minerals because the farmers aren&rsquo;t</p><p>putting them back into putting three</p><p>minerals phosphorus nitrogen and one</p><p>other mineral but trace minerals mainly</p><p>come from the sea or where I get it from</p><p>it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s an ancient 71 or 72 million</p><p>years ago the prehistoric plant life</p><p>that&rsquo;s where I get it from this layer</p><p>and the earth they mix water but you can</p><p>if you buy food that&rsquo;s grown on soils</p><p>close to the ocean you might get some or</p><p>if you can buy food that&rsquo;s grown like an</p><p>some soils that have a volcanic you know</p><p>ash that that would be another one but</p><p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of really hard to find</p><p>all the trace minerals in in the food</p><p>nowadays so that&rsquo;s probably what you&rsquo;re</p><p>running into you could do sea kelp</p><p>seaweed but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p><p>difficult it&rsquo;s probably the number one</p><p>missing nutrient that Americans at least</p><p>Americans have but if you live on the</p><p>coast of Africa or something like that</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna get all your trace minerals</p><p>that&rsquo;s probably why Africans have</p><p>perfect bone structure and their teeth</p><p>if they don&rsquo;t even go to a dentist I</p><p>mean their proteins are good their</p><p>tendons are good their muscles are good</p><p>then you then they come to America right</p><p>amazing with you and the gentlemen in</p><p>Africa that had had lost so much weight</p><p>he&rsquo;s turning starting this keto movement</p><p>there in this education process of his</p><p>own that was that was amazing yes</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s amazing it&rsquo;s very cool well</p><p>we&rsquo;ll have to share we&rsquo;ll have to do</p><p>another interview maybe like in several</p><p>months and after you include your</p><p>workouts and just take it
