    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing aggression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain to you</p>
<p>that there are several different types of aggression.</p>
<p>For instance, reactive aggression</p>
<p>versus proactive aggression,</p>
<p>meaning sometimes people will be aggressive</p>
<p>because they feel threatened</p>
<p>or they are protecting those that they love</p>
<p>who also feel threatened.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also proactive aggression</p>
<p>where people go out of their way</p>
<p>to deliberately try and harm others.</p>
<p>And there is indirect aggression,</p>
<p>which is aggression not involving physical violence.</p>
<p>For instance, shaming people and things of that sort.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms</p>
<p>underlying each of the different types of aggression.</p>
<p>And today I will define those for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body</p>
<p>that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression.</p>
<p>Talk about some of the hormones and peptides</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters involved.</p>
<p>I promise to make it all accessible to you,</p>
<p>even if you do not have any biology or science background.</p>
<p>I will also discuss tools,</p>
<p>psychological tools and biological tools</p>
<p>that one can use to better control aggression.</p>
<p>Now, right here at the outset,</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression</p>
<p>has to have an element of context within it.</p>
<p>To be fair, human beings invest a lot of money,</p>
<p>a lot of time and a lot of energy,</p>
<p>and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression.</p>
<p>Later, I&rsquo;ll talk about neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body that reinforce,</p>
<p>in other words, reward through the release of chemicals</p>
<p>that make people feel good, acts of aggression.</p>
<p>However, what I&rsquo;m mainly referring to</p>
<p>is the context in which human beings will pay money</p>
<p>in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression.</p>
<p>Put it simply, people spend an enormous amount of money</p>
<p>and time and energy watching other people engage in,</p>
<p>for instance, aggressive sports.</p>
<p>And we know that observing your team winning</p>
<p>over another team causes the release of neurochemicals</p>
<p>in your brain and body that make you feel good,</p>
<p>and yes, that can make you feel more aggressive.</p>
<p>We also know, of course,</p>
<p>that most governments invest many billions,</p>
<p>if not trillions of dollars,</p>
<p>in infrastructure technologies and human beings</p>
<p>in order to engage in aggression if needed,</p>
<p>so-called military warfare, et cetera.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s discussion will include a description</p>
<p>of aggression in the pathological sense.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder</p>
<p>that most of you probably haven&rsquo;t heard of,</p>
<p>but is actually far more common than perhaps you know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the role of things</p>
<p>like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</p>
<p>and how that can relate to aggression</p>
<p>through the relationship between impulsivity and aggression.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression,</p>
<p>proactive aggression, as mentioned before,</p>
<p>and reactive aggression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that by the end of the episode,</p>
<p>you will come away with a much more thorough understanding</p>
<p>of what this thing that we call aggression really is.</p>
<p>And when you see it in other people,</p>
<p>I think it will make more sense to you.</p>
<p>And when you observe it in yourself</p>
<p>or the impulse to engage in aggression,</p>
<p>verbal or physical or otherwise,</p>
<p>I hope that you&rsquo;ll understand it better as well.</p>
<p>And of course, the tools that I will describe</p>
<p>should allow you to modulate and control</p>
<p>aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness</p>
<p>and just generally to be able to engage with people</p>
<p>in a more adaptive way overall.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything</p>
<p>you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about aggression.</p>
<p>I think that many people out there</p>
<p>are put off by aggression,</p>
<p>although others are drawn to aggression,</p>
<p>both in themselves and when observing it in others.</p>
<p>The reason to talk about aggression is that,</p>
<p>as mentioned before,</p>
<p>the context of aggression really matters.</p>
<p>So there are instances where aggression is adaptive.</p>
<p>For instance, a mother protecting her children</p>
<p>if she&rsquo;s being attacked</p>
<p>or if her children are being threatened.</p>
<p>I think most people would agree</p>
<p>that so-called maternal aggression of that sort,</p>
<p>provided the context is right, is a great thing.</p>
<p>Protecting our young is, after all,</p>
<p>one of the primary adaptive drives of our species,</p>
<p>and thank goodness it is.</p>
<p>Of course, other forms of aggression</p>
<p>like unprovoked proactive aggression,</p>
<p>somebody simply being violent to somebody else,</p>
<p>even when unprovoked,</p>
<p>most of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior.</p>
<p>It can even evoke aggression in people</p>
<p>when they observe that kind of behavior.</p>
<p>So again, context really matters.</p>
<p>But a more general and perhaps an even more important reason</p>
<p>to think about and understand aggression</p>
<p>is that by understanding the biology</p>
<p>and psychology of aggression,</p>
<p>you will be in a much better position</p>
<p>to understand how all emotional states come to be,</p>
<p>both in yourself and in others.</p>
<p>For instance, many of you have probably heard the statement</p>
<p>that I believe arises from pop psychology,</p>
<p>not from formal academic psychology,</p>
<p>that aggression is just sadness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of sadness that&rsquo;s amplified</p>
<p>and it shows up as aggression.</p>
<p>But when we look at the underlying biology</p>
<p>and the peer-reviewed literature on this,</p>
<p>nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>We have distinct circuits in the brain</p>
<p>for aggression versus grief and mourning.</p>
<p>Those are non-overlapping.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t be sad and aggressive</p>
<p>or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time.</p>
<p>But the idea that sadness and aggression</p>
<p>are one in the same thing is simply not true.</p>
<p>And by understanding that,</p>
<p>or perhaps by understanding that irritability</p>
<p>and aggression are not the same thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be in a much better position</p>
<p>to apply some of the tools</p>
<p>that we will talk about in this episode</p>
<p>in order to be able to reduce or eliminate,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s adaptive to you, to modulate aggression.</p>
<p>And yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression,</p>
<p>in some cases, even amplifying aggression can be adaptive.</p>
<p>Now, this of course is not the first discussion</p>
<p>about the biology of aggression</p>
<p>or the psychology of aggression.</p>
<p>And we really can look to the beginning of the last century</p>
<p>as the time in which the formal study</p>
<p>of aggression really began.</p>
<p>One of the names that&rsquo;s most associated</p>
<p>with the formal study of aggression</p>
<p>is none other than Conrad Lorenz.</p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with that name.</p>
<p>Others of you may not be familiar with that name.</p>
<p>Conrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors</p>
<p>and fixed action pattern behaviors.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s most famous, at least in scientific circles,</p>
<p>for getting geese to believe that he was their parent.</p>
<p>And if you were to put into Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz,</p>
<p>just as it sounds, Conrad Lorenz, geese,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see a lot of photos of Conrad</p>
<p>walking down roads with a lot of geese following him</p>
<p>or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him.</p>
<p>He had a habit of geese adopting him</p>
<p>because of the behaviors that he partook in.</p>
<p>So he would swim out on a lake</p>
<p>in front of a bunch of little geese,</p>
<p>and then they would think that he was the parent</p>
<p>and they would imprint on him.</p>
<p>He even lived with these animals and they lived with him.</p>
<p>Sort of a strange character from what I hear.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, all this work was deserving</p>
<p>of a Nobel prize because what he discovered</p>
<p>were fixed action patterns.</p>
<p>That is patterns of behavior that could be evoked</p>
<p>by a single stimulus, okay?</p>
<p>This is really important.</p>
<p>The idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors,</p>
<p>like swimming behind a parent</p>
<p>or looking to somebody for comfort and only them.</p>
<p>The idea that you could get a huge category</p>
<p>of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts</p>
<p>triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable</p>
<p>because what it suggested and what turns out to be true</p>
<p>is that there are neural circuits,</p>
<p>not just individual brain areas,</p>
<p>but collections of brain areas that work together</p>
<p>to engage a pattern of behaviors.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first fundamental principle</p>
<p>that we need to define today.</p>
<p>That when we talk about aggression,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about activation of neural circuits,</p>
<p>not individual brain areas, but neural circuits</p>
<p>that get played out in sequence, like he&rsquo;s on a piano.</p>
<p>But that playing out in sequence</p>
<p>means that aggression is a verb.</p>
<p>It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a process, it&rsquo;s not an event.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll see, that turns out to be very important</p>
<p>in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression,</p>
<p>prevent it from happening before it&rsquo;s initiated,</p>
<p>or maybe even prolonging aggression</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<p>Now, Conrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously he knew there was this thing</p>
<p>that we call a brain and a nervous system.</p>
<p>And he knew that there were chemicals in the brain</p>
<p>and hormones and things of that sort</p>
<p>that were likely to play a role.</p>
<p>But he really didn&rsquo;t take any measures</p>
<p>to define what the neural circuits were.</p>
<p>Frankly, he didn&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>He had his Nobel Prize and he did all this beautiful work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known for an abundance of work.</p>
<p>But he did think about what sorts of underlying processes</p>
<p>could drive something like aggression.</p>
<p>And he talked about one particular feature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s especially important.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s this notion of a pressure.</p>
<p>The idea that, yes, certain hormones will bias somebody</p>
<p>or an animal to be aggressive.</p>
<p>Certain neurotransmitter states,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll learn what those are today,</p>
<p>will bias somebody to be more or less aggressive,</p>
<p>maybe even submissive and passive,</p>
<p>maybe outright proactively aggressive</p>
<p>towards anyone or anything in front of them.</p>
<p>And yes, of course, there will be historical features</p>
<p>based on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>He understood that there will be a constellation of things</p>
<p>that would drive people to be aggressive.</p>
<p>And he described a so-called pressure,</p>
<p>almost like a hydraulic pressure.</p>
<p>Just think about fluid pressure in a small container</p>
<p>being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can</p>
<p>or the container is ready to explode.</p>
<p>And how multiple features, multiple variables</p>
<p>could impinge on that and create that pressure.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s exactly the way the system works.</p>
<p>There is no single brain area</p>
<p>that flips the switch for aggression.</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;ll soon talk about a brain structure</p>
<p>that generally houses the propensity</p>
<p>and the output of aggression.</p>
<p>This notion of a hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>that can drive us toward aggressive behavior,</p>
<p>or conversely can be very low pressure</p>
<p>and keep us in a state of non-reactivity,</p>
<p>maybe even passivity or submissiveness,</p>
<p>is a very important feature</p>
<p>because it really captures the essence</p>
<p>of how neural circuits work</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about primitive behaviors generally.</p>
<p>And you can start to notice this in yourself and in others.</p>
<p>You can start to notice</p>
<p>when you are veering toward aggression,</p>
<p>or when someone is veering toward aggression,</p>
<p>verbal or physical.</p>
<p>Now that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>that Lorenz was referring to.</p>
<p>And it really does have an underlying biological basis.</p>
<p>Now it was some years later</p>
<p>that the first experiments came along,</p>
<p>which really started to identify the brain areas</p>
<p>and the biological so-called pressures</p>
<p>that can induce aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>And the person that really gets credit for this</p>
<p>is a guy by the name of Walter Hess,</p>
<p>who at that time was working on cats.</p>
<p>And I know that when you say working on cats,</p>
<p>a lot of people will cringe,</p>
<p>a lot of people have cats as pets,</p>
<p>and certainly cats can be delightful.</p>
<p>Some people like them more, some people like them less.</p>
<p>Most people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats.</p>
<p>I should say that these days,</p>
<p>very few laboratories work on cats.</p>
<p>Most laboratories that work on animal models</p>
<p>will work on flies, drosophila fruit flies,</p>
<p>for their capacity to do genetics,</p>
<p>on laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice.</p>
<p>And occasionally you&rsquo;ll find a lab that still works on cats.</p>
<p>Back in the time of Hess,</p>
<p>very few laboratories worked on mice.</p>
<p>Most laboratories worked on cats or rats.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is nowadays,</p>
<p>most laboratories use mice if they use animal models</p>
<p>because of the genetic tools that exist in mice</p>
<p>to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera,</p>
<p>which can&rsquo;t be done in humans or non-human primates,</p>
<p>at least not very easily at this point in history.</p>
<p>So when I say he was working on cats,</p>
<p>I realized that probably evokes some negative emotions</p>
<p>in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you.</p>
<p>What we can do, however, is look at the data</p>
<p>and make use of the data in terms of our understanding.</p>
<p>What Hess did was he had cats that were awake</p>
<p>and he was able to lower stimulating electrode</p>
<p>into their brain.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that the brain</p>
<p>does not have any pain sensors.</p>
<p>So after a small hole is made in the skull,</p>
<p>electrodes are lowered into the brain.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s done commonly in human neurosurgery.</p>
<p>And he was able to stimulate different brain areas.</p>
<p>And he was sort of poking around.</p>
<p>And when I say sort of,</p>
<p>he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t just poking around in there for fun.</p>
<p>He was trying to identify brain regions</p>
<p>that could generate entire categories of behavior,</p>
<p>a la Lorenz, right?</p>
<p>These fixed action pattern behaviors.</p>
<p>Eventually his electrode landed in a site</p>
<p>and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat</p>
<p>that caused this otherwise passive purring, relaxing cat</p>
<p>to suddenly go into an absolute rage.</p>
<p>So arched back, hissing, hair up,</p>
<p>so-called pyloreaction where the hairs go up.</p>
<p>Animals try and make themselves as big as possible</p>
<p>often when they&rsquo;re aggressive.</p>
<p>Drooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not,</p>
<p>cats and other animals can do this.</p>
<p>And the cat tried to attack him or anyone else</p>
<p>and anything else, even inanimate objects</p>
<p>when he stimulated this particular brain area.</p>
<p>So Hess obviously took notice</p>
<p>of this incredible transformation in behavior.</p>
<p>And the fact that when he turned off the stimulation</p>
<p>of this particular brain area,</p>
<p>the cat very quickly within seconds</p>
<p>went back to being passive, calm kitty.</p>
<p>Now, of course, he repeated this experiment</p>
<p>in other animals because he had to confirm</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t just happenstance,</p>
<p>that there wasn&rsquo;t something unique about this one cat</p>
<p>that perhaps he had stimulated an area</p>
<p>that had been built up during the kittenhood</p>
<p>of this cat and had been reactivated.</p>
<p>Maybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life</p>
<p>or scared and reactivation of a particular circuit</p>
<p>unique to that cat created this aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>Every cat that he looked at</p>
<p>and stimulated this particular brain area,</p>
<p>the cat would immediately go into an aggressive,</p>
<p>almost rage type behavior.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we can&rsquo;t anthropomorphize.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the cat was feeling.</p>
<p>For all we know, the cat could be happy,</p>
<p>although that seems pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>And later experiments done in mice, but also in humans,</p>
<p>confirm that indeed stimulation of this brain area</p>
<p>evoke not just behavioral aggression,</p>
<p>but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger.</p>
<p>So what was this incredible brain area?</p>
<p>Or rather I should say, what is the brain area</p>
<p>that harbored this incredible capacity</p>
<p>to generate aggressive behavior in Hess&rsquo;s experiments?</p>
<p>Well, for those of you that are regular listeners</p>
<p>to this podcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably be relieved to know that today</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about some new neural circuits.</p>
<p>Oftentimes we&rsquo;ll center back on the amygdala</p>
<p>or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up.</p>
<p>And for those of you that haven&rsquo;t heard them before,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll make it clear</p>
<p>as to what those brain areas are and what they do.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about</p>
<p>the so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus,</p>
<p>meaning a small collection of neurons.</p>
<p>What are neurons?</p>
<p>Nerve cells.</p>
<p>And that small collection of neurons</p>
<p>that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain</p>
<p>and a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side of your brain.</p>
<p>And that combined 3,000 neurons or so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not exactly 3,000, but 3,000 neurons or so</p>
<p>is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior</p>
<p>of the sort that Hess observed in the cat.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>when you see somebody who&rsquo;s in the act of rage</p>
<p>or in an act of verbal aggression</p>
<p>or in an act of defensive aggression,</p>
<p>protecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera,</p>
<p>almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior.</p>
<p>Those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior.</p>
<p>And next I&rsquo;ll describe some experiments</p>
<p>that were done just recently</p>
<p>within the last 10 years or so,</p>
<p>but leading right up until this year and even last month</p>
<p>that keep confirming again and again and again</p>
<p>that it is the activity of neurons</p>
<p>in the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>that are both necessary and sufficient</p>
<p>to generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors.</p>
<p>Now, before I go further to describe</p>
<p>the beautiful recent studies on the VMH,</p>
<p>the ventromedial hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and the important role of testosterone</p>
<p>and more importantly, estrogen</p>
<p>in the activation of aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s soon to be clear to you</p>
<p>why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>is something that we should all care about.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that many categories</p>
<p>of psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,</p>
<p>and psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia,</p>
<p>PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,</p>
<p>borderline personality disorder,</p>
<p>and even certain forms of autism</p>
<p>can include elements of aggression and even violence.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s certainly not the case</p>
<p>that aggression and violence are present</p>
<p>in all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD</p>
<p>or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely not saying that.</p>
<p>However, it can be a feature of those,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a well-described feature</p>
<p>in terms of trying to understand the constellation</p>
<p>of challenges that people suffer from when they have those.</p>
<p>So thinking about the VMH goes way beyond</p>
<p>just understanding basic aggression</p>
<p>in the context of adaptive aggression.</p>
<p>So when earlier I used the example of maternal aggression,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one adaptive form of aggression.</p>
<p>It also can be pathologic aggression,</p>
<p>meaning it can harm ourselves or others.</p>
<p>So keep this in mind as we go forward</p>
<p>because later we&rsquo;re going to talk about specific tools</p>
<p>designed to modulate or prevent aggression in,</p>
<p>for instance, people with attention deficit</p>
<p>hyperactivity disorder, and especially kids with ADHD.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let&rsquo;s return to the VMH,</p>
<p>this relatively small collection of neurons.</p>
<p>And the reason I say relatively small is,</p>
<p>well, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons,</p>
<p>maybe even trillions of neurons.</p>
<p>The exact number of neurons isn&rsquo;t really clear,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a lot, and it certainly is a lot</p>
<p>relative to the number of neurons</p>
<p>3,000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus</p>
<p>that can evoke this aggressive response.</p>
<p>Experiments done by David Anderson&rsquo;s lab at Caltech</p>
<p>were really the first to parse the fine circuitry</p>
<p>and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>These are important experiments</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re worth knowing about.</p>
<p>What they did was they identified,</p>
<p>first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>was in the mouse.</p>
<p>That was pretty straightforward to do,</p>
<p>it was sort of known before they started these experiments.</p>
<p>And then they analyzed which genes, meaning which DNA,</p>
<p>which of course becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein,</p>
<p>which DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed</p>
<p>in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there&rsquo;s a particular category</p>
<p>of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>that make an estrogen receptor.</p>
<p>And it is those neurons in particular</p>
<p>that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>How did they know this?</p>
<p>Well, they used a tool that&rsquo;s actually been described</p>
<p>by a previous guest of this podcast.</p>
<p>We had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer</p>
<p>and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>He and others have developed tools</p>
<p>that allow people to control the activity of neurons</p>
<p>essentially by remote control,</p>
<p>by shining light on those neurons.</p>
<p>So in the context of an experiment on a mouse,</p>
<p>which is what David&rsquo;s lab did,</p>
<p>and these were the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now in her own laboratory at New York University,</p>
<p>put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain</p>
<p>into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse.</p>
<p>The mouse is able to move around in its cage,</p>
<p>freely moving, even though it has a little tether,</p>
<p>this little wire, it&rsquo;s a very thin wire.</p>
<p>And that little thin wire</p>
<p>is actually a little what we call optrode.</p>
<p>And the experimentalist, in this case Dayu,</p>
<p>was able to stimulate the turning on</p>
<p>of a little bit of blue light.</p>
<p>And that blue light activated</p>
<p>only those estrogen receptor neurons</p>
<p>in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And the way she was able to do that</p>
<p>is she had introduced a gene</p>
<p>that had been developed by our friend, Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>that allows light to trigger electrical activity</p>
<p>in those neurons.</p>
<p>So if any of that is confusing</p>
<p>or if all of that is confusing, here&rsquo;s the experiment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mouse in a cage,</p>
<p>has a little wire coming out of its head.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t notice, believe it or not.</p>
<p>We know this because it&rsquo;s still eating and mating</p>
<p>and doing all the things that mice like to do</p>
<p>on daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the mere pressing of a button</p>
<p>will activate a little bit of light</p>
<p>released at the end of that wire.</p>
<p>That light activates particular neurons.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s the estrogen receptor containing neurons</p>
<p>in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>When that mouse is in a cage with another mouse,</p>
<p>a couple of things happen</p>
<p>depending on what the other mouse is,</p>
<p>or we could say who the other mouse is.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a male mouse</p>
<p>and you put in there with a female mouse,</p>
<p>the male mouse will attempt to mate with the female mouse.</p>
<p>Provided that the male mouse has gone through puberty,</p>
<p>he will try to mount and mate with the female mouse.</p>
<p>Now, female mice are either in a receptive phase</p>
<p>or a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a menstrual 28-day cycle.</p>
<p>They have an estrous cycle.</p>
<p>And on particular days of that estrous cycle,</p>
<p>they are not happy to mate.</p>
<p>They will basically keep their hindquarters</p>
<p>away from the male mouse at all costs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll even attack the male mouse.</p>
<p>On certain days of the estrous cycle, however,</p>
<p>the female mouse will undergo what&rsquo;s called lordosis,</p>
<p>which is an arching of her back,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll allow the male to mount and mate with her.</p>
<p>So a large number of experiments were done,</p>
<p>but the first experiment really was to put the male mouse</p>
<p>in with a female mouse</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in the so-called receptive phase of estrous.</p>
<p>That is, she will allow mating.</p>
<p>And he starts mating with her.</p>
<p>And they go through the standard repertoire</p>
<p>of mating behaviors that you observe in mice,</p>
<p>mounting, thrusting, intromission,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called in the mouse sex world.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I don&rsquo;t know what the mice call it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what the experimenters call it.</p>
<p>And then afterwards, he will dismount, okay?</p>
<p>So they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very typical.</p>
<p>But about halfway through the behavior,</p>
<p>Dayu turned on the light</p>
<p>to stimulate these estrogen receptor-containing neurons</p>
<p>only in the male mouse.</p>
<p>And what she observed was incredibly dramatic.</p>
<p>The male mouse ceases from trying to mate</p>
<p>with the female mouse</p>
<p>and immediately tries to kill the female mouse.</p>
<p>He starts attacking her.</p>
<p>Then she turns off the light, the male stops,</p>
<p>and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure all of this was very confusing</p>
<p>and disturbing to the female mouse.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that was the repertoire.</p>
<p>They would mate.</p>
<p>She would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.</p>
<p>The male mouse would immediately try and attack</p>
<p>and kill the female mouse.</p>
<p>And then she would stop the stimulation</p>
<p>and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse,</p>
<p>return to the attempt, at least,</p>
<p>to mate with the female mouse.</p>
<p>These are such dramatic shifts in behavior</p>
<p>triggered only by the activation</p>
<p>of only this small set of neurons</p>
<p>within the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And for those of you that think</p>
<p>that you can watch this sort of thing</p>
<p>without being disturbed,</p>
<p>I encourage you to go to YouTube.</p>
<p>We will provide a link</p>
<p>where you can see a video of this type of behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly dramatic.</p>
<p>The shift in behavior is almost instantaneous,</p>
<p>occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds,</p>
<p>thousandths of a second.</p>
<p>The next experiment that she did</p>
<p>was to put a male mouse with this stimulation</p>
<p>and with light capability</p>
<p>in its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone,</p>
<p>but with a rubber glove filled with air or water.</p>
<p>Mouse was walking around, sniffing, peeing,</p>
<p>which is what male mice seem to do.</p>
<p>They seem to urinate everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually an interesting,</p>
<p>perhaps interesting feature of male mice</p>
<p>and actually many male animals,</p>
<p>perhaps even humans, we don&rsquo;t know, or maybe we do know.</p>
<p>Basically, this has been observed time and time again</p>
<p>in experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers&rsquo; lab</p>
<p>at the Scripps Institute has characterized this.</p>
<p>If you put female mice into an arena or a cage,</p>
<p>they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage.</p>
<p>Whereas if you put male mice into an arena or a cage,</p>
<p>they urinate everywhere.</p>
<p>They have this kind of obsession</p>
<p>with spraying their urine everywhere.</p>
<p>You can sort of transpose that to human behavior</p>
<p>if you like.</p>
<p>In any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone,</p>
<p>but with this rubber glove.</p>
<p>The mouse is walking around, urinating, et cetera,</p>
<p>doing whatever it is that mice do.</p>
<p>Then she stimulates the activation</p>
<p>of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.</p>
<p>And the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove.</p>
<p>It goes into a rage attacking the glove</p>
<p>as if it were another mouse or some other animate object.</p>
<p>But of course it&rsquo;s an inanimate object.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a rubber glove.</p>
<p>She stops the stimulation and the mouse immediately goes</p>
<p>back to being completely calm, or at least not attacking.</p>
<p>Again, we don&rsquo;t know what the mouse was feeling.</p>
<p>So these are very dramatic videos.</p>
<p>Again, you can see them by following the link</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll provide in the caption.</p>
<p>If that sort of thing is going to disturb you</p>
<p>to see, for instance, one mouse attacking another,</p>
<p>please just don&rsquo;t watch them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in traumatizing anybody,</p>
<p>or you traumatizing yourself, that is.</p>
<p>A number of different variations were done</p>
<p>on this experiment.</p>
<p>For instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice,</p>
<p>as opposed to male mice, putting the female mice</p>
<p>in with other female mice or with other male mice.</p>
<p>No matter what variation one carries out.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s male with female,</p>
<p>male with male, female with female, et cetera.</p>
<p>Stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>in a male mouse or a female mouse evokes</p>
<p>this very dramatic, almost instantaneous</p>
<p>aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Subsequent experiments done by Dayulin in her own laboratory</p>
<p>and other laboratories have shown</p>
<p>that the ventromedial hypothalamus is connected</p>
<p>with a bunch of other brain areas that are interesting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about some of those in a little bit,</p>
<p>but one of them that I want to call out now</p>
<p>is the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus.</p>
<p>This is a large structure in the back of the brain</p>
<p>that houses things like neurons that can create opioids.</p>
<p>We all know of the opioid crisis,</p>
<p>but these are neurons that can produce endogenous means,</p>
<p>made by the body, chemicals that can cause pain relief.</p>
<p>You could understand why that might occur</p>
<p>in a circuit for aggression, right?</p>
<p>Even if one is the aggressor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that they may incur some physical damage</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d want some pain relief.</p>
<p>The PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits</p>
<p>that eventually through several processing stations,</p>
<p>excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws.</p>
<p>And in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior.</p>
<p>Now, aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting</p>
<p>because in humans, and especially in human children,</p>
<p>biting is something that while young children might do</p>
<p>as a form of aggression,</p>
<p>tends to disappear pretty early in childhood.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s often seen as a mark of pathology.</p>
<p>I have a story about this, actually.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll never forget this, we were playing soccer</p>
<p>and in a rare stroke of luck or accident,</p>
<p>I happened to score a goal.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t a particularly good soccer player,</p>
<p>especially not at that stage of my life.</p>
<p>They later figured out that it was just better</p>
<p>to make me a fullback</p>
<p>because I could just wait there and do what fullbacks do.</p>
<p>I was better at taking the ball or the person out</p>
<p>than I was putting the ball in the goal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I, again, by chance, I scored a goal</p>
<p>and I was trotting back to my side of the field.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I felt this sting in my back,</p>
<p>a kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what his name was.</p>
<p>A kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back.</p>
<p>And this of course resulted in a discussion and a timeout</p>
<p>and all the usual things and parents, I think got involved,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall, I didn&rsquo;t think much else of it.</p>
<p>But I recall that this was considered</p>
<p>especially troubling behavior because he bit me</p>
<p>as opposed to hit me or shoved me down</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>And it does seem as if the tendency to use biting</p>
<p>as an aggressive behavior is associated</p>
<p>with a more primitive circuitry.</p>
<p>Now here I&rsquo;m truly anthropomorphizing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what this other kid happened to be thinking</p>
<p>or feeling at the time.</p>
<p>How could I?</p>
<p>And I certainly am not going to say that biting</p>
<p>in every case reflects a pathology.</p>
<p>Although I think there is general agreement</p>
<p>in the psychology community, in the psychiatric community</p>
<p>that past a certain age, the using of one&rsquo;s teeth</p>
<p>to impart aggression and damage on others</p>
<p>is a particularly primitive and troubling,</p>
<p>or at least for the observer,</p>
<p>the person that experiences a pretty disturbing event.</p>
<p>Dayu&rsquo;s lab has shown that activation</p>
<p>of the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>triggers a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray,</p>
<p>which then triggers a whole other set of circuits</p>
<p>of fixed action patterns.</p>
<p>Here we are back to Lorenz again with fixed action patterns,</p>
<p>including swinging of the limbs, right?</p>
<p>Punching, this wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be controlled punching,</p>
<p>but also biting behavior.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s remarkable to me, at least,</p>
<p>that we have circuits in our brain</p>
<p>that can evoke violent use of things like our mouth</p>
<p>or violent use of things like our limbs</p>
<p>that of course could be used for things like singing</p>
<p>or kissing or eating or gesticulating</p>
<p>in any kind of polite or impolite way.</p>
<p>The point here is that neural circuits,</p>
<p>not individual brain areas,</p>
<p>evoke the constellation of behaviors</p>
<p>that we call aggression.</p>
<p>Now, many of you are probably puzzled,</p>
<p>or at least should be,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>this highly specialized brain area,</p>
<p>the ventromedial hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and this highly specialized subcategory of neurons</p>
<p>in the ventromedial hypothalamus,</p>
<p>these neurons that make estrogen receptor.</p>
<p>And yet the activation of those cells</p>
<p>triggers dramatic and immediate aggression,</p>
<p>both in males and in females,</p>
<p>and both against males and against females.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Most of us think about estrogen</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t immediately think of aggression.</p>
<p>Most of us hear testosterone</p>
<p>and we might think about aggression,</p>
<p>although other things as well.</p>
<p>In order to understand this,</p>
<p>I just want to briefly refer back to a conversation</p>
<p>that I had on a previous episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and that was with my colleague,</p>
<p>the great Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>of course, is a professor at Stanford</p>
<p>who studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior</p>
<p>as well as estrogen and other hormones</p>
<p>and their impacts on behavior.</p>
<p>To make a long story short,</p>
<p>and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth,</p>
<p>testosterone does not increase aggressiveness.</p>
<p>Testosterone increases proactivity</p>
<p>and the willingness to lean into effort</p>
<p>in competitive scenarios.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis,</p>
<p>but to make a long story short,</p>
<p>if people are given testosterone,</p>
<p>or if you look at people who have different levels,</p>
<p>excuse me, of testosterone endogenously</p>
<p>that they naturally make,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that testosterone</p>
<p>tends to increase competitiveness,</p>
<p>but not just in aggressive scenarios.</p>
<p>So if somebody is already aggressive,</p>
<p>giving them testosterone will have the tendency</p>
<p>to make them more aggressive.</p>
<p>If somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic,</p>
<p>giving them testosterone will make them more benevolent</p>
<p>and altruistic, at least up to a point.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are certain forms</p>
<p>of synthetic testosterone that are known in sports circles</p>
<p>and in other circles to increase aggressiveness</p>
<p>because of the way those particular forms</p>
<p>of synthetic testosterone work.</p>
<p>But in general, most of the experiments</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m referring to have not been done using those.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been done using the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call them the more traditional</p>
<p>biological forms of testosterone</p>
<p>or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone.</p>
<p>In fact, Robert Sapolsky described</p>
<p>a really interesting experiment in which</p>
<p>if you look at testosterone levels</p>
<p>or you administer additional testosterone</p>
<p>to people who are doing philanthropy,</p>
<p>giving money to organizations,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re essentially doing good</p>
<p>because these are organizations doing good,</p>
<p>what you find is that increased testosterone</p>
<p>or further increasing testosterone</p>
<p>makes people more willing to compete</p>
<p>to give more money than the other person in the room</p>
<p>in order to put it in air quotes,</p>
<p>to alpha out the other person by giving more money.</p>
<p>So this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy.</p>
<p>It is not an act of aggression.</p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t know what the people</p>
<p>are feeling underneath all that.</p>
<p>Again, we can&rsquo;t anthropomorphize</p>
<p>or project onto other people what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>But the point is that testosterone itself</p>
<p>does not make people more aggressive.</p>
<p>And in the experiments that we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>up until now, it&rsquo;s actually the activation</p>
<p>of estrogen receptor containing neurons</p>
<p>that makes these animals more aggressive.</p>
<p>And it turns out there&rsquo;s evidence that in certain contexts,</p>
<p>estrogen can make people more aggressive.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s going on is that testosterone</p>
<p>can be converted into estrogen</p>
<p>through a process called aromatization.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enzyme called aromatase.</p>
<p>Anytime you have a word that ends in A-S-E,</p>
<p>at least if it&rsquo;s in the context of biology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost always, not always, but almost always an enzyme.</p>
<p>So the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen.</p>
<p>And it is actually testosterone aromatized,</p>
<p>converted into estrogen,</p>
<p>and then binding to these estrogen-containing neurons</p>
<p>in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression.</p>
<p>I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>It is not testosterone itself that triggers aggression.</p>
<p>It is testosterone aromatized into estrogen</p>
<p>within the brain and binding to these estrogen</p>
<p>receptor-containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that.</p>
<p>Now, this effect of estrogen causing aggression</p>
<p>in the brain is very robust.</p>
<p>So much so that if you take a mouse</p>
<p>that lacks the aromatase enzyme,</p>
<p>or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme,</p>
<p>and they do exist,</p>
<p>then there is a reduction in overall aggression</p>
<p>despite high levels of testosterone.</p>
<p>And if people who, or mice who have the aromatase enzyme,</p>
<p>have that enzyme blocked,</p>
<p>well, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how much you increase testosterone</p>
<p>or any of its other derivatives,</p>
<p>you do not observe this aggression.</p>
<p>So this runs counter to everything that we know</p>
<p>and think about the role of testosterone.</p>
<p>Again, testosterone increases competitiveness.</p>
<p>It can increase the desire to work under challenge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, and I ran this,</p>
<p>or pressure tested this against Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been working on testosterone</p>
<p>and its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect</p>
<p>of making effort feel good,</p>
<p>or at least increasing the threshold</p>
<p>at which effort feels bad or unsustainable.</p>
<p>And it does that by way of changing the activity</p>
<p>or the threshold for activation of brain structures</p>
<p>like the amygdala and other brain structures</p>
<p>associated with anxiety.</p>
<p>So the next time somebody says,</p>
<p>testosterone makes people aggressive,</p>
<p>you can say, ah, no, actually it&rsquo;s estrogen</p>
<p>that makes people aggressive,</p>
<p>and animals aggressive for that matter.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it is the case that because males</p>
<p>have relatively less estrogen circulating</p>
<p>in their brain and body than females, right?</p>
<p>Because they have testes, not ovaries,</p>
<p>that testosterone is required in the first place</p>
<p>in order to be converted into estrogen</p>
<p>to activate this aggressive circuit</p>
<p>involving these estrogen receptor-containing neurons</p>
<p>in the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step.</p>
<p>It is the hormone on which aggression hinges.</p>
<p>And I think for most people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a quite surprising finding.</p>
<p>And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings</p>
<p>in both the animal and human literature</p>
<p>as it relates to hormones</p>
<p>and psychological states and behavior.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it is the case that if testosterone is low,</p>
<p>that a person or an animal</p>
<p>will exhibit less aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not because of reduced testosterone per se,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone.</p>
<p>Meaning if there&rsquo;s no testosterone</p>
<p>to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve established that it&rsquo;s not testosterone</p>
<p>but testosterone converted into estrogen</p>
<p>that activates these circuits for aggression.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it&rsquo;s still surprising, right?</p>
<p>I mean, most of us don&rsquo;t think about estrogen</p>
<p>as the hormone that stimulates aggression,</p>
<p>but it turns out it&rsquo;s all contextual.</p>
<p>There are beautiful data showing that</p>
<p>whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression</p>
<p>can be powerfully modulated</p>
<p>by whether or not days are short or days are long.</p>
<p>In other words, whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of sunshine or not.</p>
<p>Now, obviously brain is encased in skull,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a lot of sunshine out there,</p>
<p>even though you can see the sun with your eyes,</p>
<p>you can feel it on your skin.</p>
<p>Day length is converted into hormonal signals</p>
<p>and chemical signals.</p>
<p>And the primary hormonal and chemical signals</p>
<p>involve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormone.</p>
<p>So to make a very long story short,</p>
<p>in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight,</p>
<p>both in our eyes and on our skin,</p>
<p>melatonin levels are reduced.</p>
<p>Melatonin is a hormone that tends to produce</p>
<p>states of sleepiness and quiescence.</p>
<p>It also tends to activate pathways</p>
<p>that tend to reduce things like breeding</p>
<p>and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>In long days, dopamine is increased.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a molecule associated with feelings</p>
<p>of wellbeing and motivation</p>
<p>and the desire to seek out all sorts of things,</p>
<p>all sorts of motivated behaviors.</p>
<p>And in long days, provided we&rsquo;re getting enough sunlight</p>
<p>on our skin and to our eyes,</p>
<p>the stress hormones, especially cortisol</p>
<p>and some of the other stress hormones are reduced in levels.</p>
<p>If estrogen levels are increased experimentally</p>
<p>under long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression.</p>
<p>However, in short days, if estrogen is increased,</p>
<p>there is a heightened predisposition for aggression.</p>
<p>And that makes perfect sense</p>
<p>if you think about what short days do</p>
<p>to the biology of your brain and body.</p>
<p>In short days, the melatonin signal goes up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more melatonin circulating</p>
<p>for more of each 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>Stress hormones are circulating more.</p>
<p>Why? Short days tend to be associated with winter.</p>
<p>In winter, we are bombarded with more bacteria and viruses</p>
<p>because bacteria and viruses actually survive better</p>
<p>in cold than they do in heat.</p>
<p>In fact, in my laboratory,</p>
<p>we work with a lot of viruses and bacteria.</p>
<p>And when we want to keep them alive,</p>
<p>we put them in the freezer.</p>
<p>If we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them,</p>
<p>we put them under UV light,</p>
<p>like you would see from the sunlight.</p>
<p>So shorter days are conducive to aggression,</p>
<p>not because days are short per se,</p>
<p>but because stress hormone levels are higher</p>
<p>and because dopamine levels are lower.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s where all of this starts to converge</p>
<p>on a very clear biological picture,</p>
<p>a very clear psychological picture,</p>
<p>and indeed a very clear set of tools</p>
<p>that we can think about and use.</p>
<p>Under conditions where cortisol is high,</p>
<p>where the stress hormone is elevated,</p>
<p>and under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin</p>
<p>is reduced, there is a greater propensity</p>
<p>for estrogen to trigger aggression.</p>
<p>Now, again, I know I&rsquo;ve said it before,</p>
<p>but for males who make a lot of testosterone</p>
<p>relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind</p>
<p>this idea that if testosterone is high,</p>
<p>that means that estrogen is low,</p>
<p>because while that can be true in the periphery in the body,</p>
<p>if testosterone is high,</p>
<p>there is going to be some aromatization,</p>
<p>that conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>So anytime you hear that testosterone is high,</p>
<p>you should think testosterone is high in the body</p>
<p>and perhaps estrogen is low in the body,</p>
<p>but that means that there&rsquo;s going to be heightened levels</p>
<p>of estrogen in the brain</p>
<p>and therefore increased propensity for aggression.</p>
<p>In females who generally make less testosterone</p>
<p>relative to estrogen,</p>
<p>there is sufficient estrogen already present</p>
<p>to trigger aggression.</p>
<p>So both males and females are primed for aggression,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s riding on a context,</p>
<p>and that context of whether or not you get a tendency</p>
<p>for aggression or not,</p>
<p>depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher</p>
<p>in any individual, there&rsquo;s going to be a tilt,</p>
<p>an increase in that hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>that Lorenz talked about toward aggression.</p>
<p>And if serotonin, the neuromodulator</p>
<p>that is associated with feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>and sometimes even of slight passivity,</p>
<p>but certainly of wellbeing,</p>
<p>if serotonin is low,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also going to be a further shift</p>
<p>towards an aggressive tendency.</p>
<p>So if we return to Lorenz&rsquo;s hydraulic pressure model</p>
<p>of aggression and other internal states,</p>
<p>we realize that external stimuli,</p>
<p>things that we hear, things that we see,</p>
<p>for instance, someone saying something upsetting</p>
<p>or seeing somebody do something that we don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>to others or to us,</p>
<p>as well as our internal state,</p>
<p>our subjective feelings of wellbeing,</p>
<p>but also our stress level,</p>
<p>our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources</p>
<p>and are content with what we have,</p>
<p>all of that is converging on this thing</p>
<p>that we call internal state</p>
<p>and creating this pressure</p>
<p>of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive.</p>
<p>And now we have some major players</p>
<p>feeding into that final pathway,</p>
<p>that question of whether or not,</p>
<p>will we hit the other person?</p>
<p>Will we say the thing that is considered aggressive?</p>
<p>Will we not say it?</p>
<p>If somebody says something</p>
<p>or does something aggressive to us,</p>
<p>will we respond or will we be submissive or even passive?</p>
<p>Again, there are many things funneling into that question</p>
<p>and dictating whether or not the answer is,</p>
<p>absolutely, I&rsquo;ll fight back,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to attack them even unprovoked,</p>
<p>or if they say this, I&rsquo;m going to do that,</p>
<p>or no matter what they do, I&rsquo;m not going to respond.</p>
<p>These kinds of things are very complex</p>
<p>and yet we really can boil them down</p>
<p>to just a few common elements.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m telling you that those elements</p>
<p>are whether or not cortisol levels</p>
<p>are relatively lower or relatively higher.</p>
<p>Again, relatively higher is going to tend</p>
<p>to make people more reactive, why?</p>
<p>Because reactivity is really a function</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates</p>
<p>between the so-called sympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which tends to put us into a state of readiness</p>
<p>through the release of adrenaline.</p>
<p>Cortisol and adrenaline,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re circulating in the brain and body,</p>
<p>make us more likely to move and to react and to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually what will induce a kind of low-level tremor,</p>
<p>which is an anticipatory tremor</p>
<p>to be able to move more quickly, right?</p>
<p>A body in motion is more easily set into further motion,</p>
<p>that is.</p>
<p>And the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator</p>
<p>that in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>in response to what we already have.</p>
<p>So when we are well-fed,</p>
<p>serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body,</p>
<p>in particular, well-fed with carbohydrates.</p>
<p>The precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are nice studies exploring</p>
<p>the types of diets, nutritional programs,</p>
<p>that can reduce aggressive behavior,</p>
<p>both in children and in adults.</p>
<p>And tryptophan-rich diets</p>
<p>or supplementation with tryptophan.</p>
<p>So for tryptophan-rich diets,</p>
<p>things like white turkey meat,</p>
<p>but then there are also a number of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>You can look up, it&rsquo;s very easy to find,</p>
<p>foods that contain lots of tryptophan.</p>
<p>Those foods contain the precursor to serotonin.</p>
<p>Now, it isn&rsquo;t simply the case</p>
<p>that eating more foods with tryptophan</p>
<p>will tend to reduce your aggression.</p>
<p>I suppose it could do that.</p>
<p>If you ate it in abundance, it could make you tired,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re less likely to be aggressive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend that strategy.</p>
<p>But the idea here is that when it&rsquo;s been explored,</p>
<p>increasing levels of tryptophan,</p>
<p>either by supplementation or by food,</p>
<p>or prescription drugs that increase serotonin,</p>
<p>so for instance, fluoxetine,</p>
<p>sometimes called Prozac or Zoloft</p>
<p>or any number of the other SSRIs,</p>
<p>tend to reduce aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Now, not always, but in general, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Similarly, because elevated cortisol</p>
<p>tends to shift the whole system,</p>
<p>again, create more of a hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>towards aggressive states,</p>
<p>if cortisol levels are reduced,</p>
<p>well, then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced.</p>
<p>This is supported by a number of peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide links to some of those</p>
<p>in the caption show notes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to return to these a bit later</p>
<p>in the context of specific studies</p>
<p>that have looked at genetic variants</p>
<p>in different individuals that cause them</p>
<p>to make more or less serotonin,</p>
<p>or at least to metabolize serotonin differently.</p>
<p>This is also the case</p>
<p>for so-called intermittent explosive disorder</p>
<p>that can often be associated with gene variants</p>
<p>that control how much serotonin is made</p>
<p>or how it&rsquo;s metabolized or how much cortisol is made</p>
<p>and how much it&rsquo;s metabolized.</p>
<p>In thinking about tools,</p>
<p>there are a number of things that one could consider.</p>
<p>First of all, there are a number of decent studies</p>
<p>exploring how supplementation</p>
<p>with the omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems,</p>
<p>including serotonin, that can modulate,</p>
<p>not directly mediate,</p>
<p>but modulate mood and emotional tone.</p>
<p>Supplementation with the omega-3s has been shown</p>
<p>to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contexts,</p>
<p>in things like ADHD,</p>
<p>or in individuals who have a predisposition</p>
<p>for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>are going directly to the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>and changing the activity of neurons there.</p>
<p>More likely, they are causing</p>
<p>or modulating an overall shift in mood</p>
<p>through the immune system, through hormone systems,</p>
<p>that are changing the overall tone or the propensity</p>
<p>for neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated.</p>
<p>How much omega-3 fatty acid, what source?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve talked about this on the podcast before.</p>
<p>You can, of course, get omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>from a number of different foods.</p>
<p>Getting them from whole foods</p>
<p>is probably the best way to do it.</p>
<p>But many people, including people with depression,</p>
<p>will often supplement with one gram or more</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids per day.</p>
<p>Some people, including myself, will take them every day</p>
<p>as just a general mood enhancer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suffer from depression,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve found it to be beneficial for my health.</p>
<p>And so some people will do that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>how in double-blind placebo-controlled studies,</p>
<p>people taking one to three grams</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids per day,</p>
<p>typically in the form of a high-quality fish oil,</p>
<p>although there are other sources as well,</p>
<p>algae and so forth,</p>
<p>can experience improvements in mood</p>
<p>that are on par with some of the SSRIs,</p>
<p>the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p>
<p>And of course, if you&rsquo;re prescribed an SSRI</p>
<p>by your psychiatrist or other doctor,</p>
<p>please do take that and don&rsquo;t cease to take it,</p>
<p>just simply to take omega-3s.</p>
<p>However, you might mention to them,</p>
<p>and you can find links to the studies</p>
<p>in our previous episodes on depression,</p>
<p>that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>at this one gram or more of EPA specifically,</p>
<p>so getting above that one gram threshold</p>
<p>as high as three grams per day of the EPA</p>
<p>has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs</p>
<p>and still keep their mood in a place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beneficial for them.</p>
<p>And in terms of keeping cortisol in a range</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s healthy and doesn&rsquo;t bias someone</p>
<p>toward high levels of aggression and irritability,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, again, going to be set by a number</p>
<p>of larger modulators or contextual cues.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about some of those on the podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just briefly recap them now.</p>
<p>Obviously, getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day</p>
<p>and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes</p>
<p>throughout the day is going to be important,</p>
<p>again, because of this effect of estrogen in long days,</p>
<p>not increasing aggression.</p>
<p>However, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression</p>
<p>because of the increase in cortisol observed in short days.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce cortisol was discussed</p>
<p>in our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat,</p>
<p>but also hot baths.</p>
<p>It turns out that hot baths and sauna</p>
<p>can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol.</p>
<p>All the details on that are included in the episode on heat</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s timestamped, so you can go directly to that</p>
<p>if you want to learn about the temperatures</p>
<p>and the various durations.</p>
<p>But to just give a synopsis of that,</p>
<p>a 20-minute sauna at anywhere from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to a sauna,</p>
<p>you could do a hot bath,</p>
<p>adjust the temperature so you don&rsquo;t burn yourself.</p>
<p>I think 80 to 100 degrees Celsius is going to be too hot</p>
<p>for many people if it&rsquo;s a hot bath,</p>
<p>whereas many people who can&rsquo;t tolerate that hot bath</p>
<p>can tolerate the sauna.</p>
<p>So safety first, always, and of course,</p>
<p>but hot baths reduce cortisol.</p>
<p>Hot saunas reduce cortisol of a duration</p>
<p>about 20 to 30 minutes is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>And of course, some of you may be interested</p>
<p>in exploring the supplementation route.</p>
<p>And for reductions in cortisol,</p>
<p>really the chief player there is ashwagandha,</p>
<p>which is known to decrease cortisol fairly potently.</p>
<p>I should just warn you that if you&rsquo;re going to use</p>
<p>ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol,</p>
<p>first of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider</p>
<p>before adding or subtracting anything</p>
<p>from your supplementation or health regimen.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect us,</p>
<p>I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>You are responsible for your health,</p>
<p>what you take and what you don&rsquo;t take.</p>
<p>Chronic supplementation with ashwagandha</p>
<p>can have some not so great effects of disruption</p>
<p>of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways.</p>
<p>So the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;d want to take a break of about two weeks.</p>
<p>So ashwagandha, again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol,</p>
<p>but with some other effects as well,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use it chronically for longer than two weeks.</p>
<p>But if your goal is to reduce cortisol,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going through a period</p>
<p>of increased irritability and aggressive tendency,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re also not getting as much light</p>
<p>as you would like.</p>
<p>And perhaps also if there are other circumstantial things</p>
<p>leading you towards more aggressiveness</p>
<p>and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness,</p>
<p>that can be potentially helpful.</p>
<p>And in light of all this stuff about cortisol</p>
<p>and estrogen and day length,</p>
<p>I should mention that there are in fact some people</p>
<p>who have a genetic predisposition</p>
<p>to be more irritable and aggressive.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different gene pathways</p>
<p>associated with this.</p>
<p>We never like to think about just one gene</p>
<p>causing a specific behavior.</p>
<p>The way to think about genes is that genes generally code</p>
<p>for things within our biology,</p>
<p>in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>things like neural circuits</p>
<p>or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made</p>
<p>or the amounts of hormones that are made</p>
<p>or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors</p>
<p>or enzymes, et cetera,</p>
<p>that shift the activity of our biology</p>
<p>in a particular direction, they bias our biology.</p>
<p>And in fact, there is a genetic variant</p>
<p>present in certain people</p>
<p>that adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity.</p>
<p>And that estrogen receptor sensitivity</p>
<p>can result in increased levels of aggression,</p>
<p>sometimes dramatic increases.</p>
<p>However, and also very interestingly,</p>
<p>photoperiod, meaning day length,</p>
<p>is a strong modulator of whether or not</p>
<p>that aggressiveness turns up or not,</p>
<p>whether or not that person with the particular gene variant</p>
<p>is more aggressive or not,</p>
<p>depends on how long the day is and how long the night is.</p>
<p>One particular study that I like that references this</p>
<p>is Treynor et al., the title of the study is,</p>
<p>photoperiod reverses the effects of estrogens</p>
<p>on male aggression via genomic and non-genomic pathways.</p>
<p>This was a paper published in the Proceedings</p>
<p>of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put a reference to this in the show notes</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to explore it further.</p>
<p>But it really points to the fact that rarely, sometimes,</p>
<p>but rarely is it the case that just one gene</p>
<p>will cause somebody to be hyperaggressive.</p>
<p>Almost always, there&rsquo;s going to be an interplay</p>
<p>between genetics and environment,</p>
<p>and as environment changes, such as day length changes</p>
<p>and the length of night changes,</p>
<p>so too will the tendency for people</p>
<p>with a given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not.</p>
<p>Now, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing</p>
<p>for this particular estrogen receptor variant,</p>
<p>most people, I&rsquo;m guessing you,</p>
<p>are probably not walking around knowing</p>
<p>that you have this gene or not.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think it&rsquo;s important to pay attention</p>
<p>to how you feel at different times of year,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not it&rsquo;s summer,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s winter,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re getting sufficient sunlight,</p>
<p>meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re getting sufficient sunlight</p>
<p>exposure to your skin or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re indoors all the time.</p>
<p>Generally, those things correlate with season,</p>
<p>but not always.</p>
<p>You can go through long bouts of hard work</p>
<p>in the summer months when days are long,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re indoors a lot</p>
<p>and getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure</p>
<p>late in the evening,</p>
<p>and perhaps that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re feeling more aggressive.</p>
<p>So we have to be careful about drawing</p>
<p>a one-to-one relationship between any biological feature</p>
<p>and certainly psychological or behavioral feature</p>
<p>like aggressiveness, but it&rsquo;s, I believe,</p>
<p>helpful to know that these genetic biases exist,</p>
<p>how they play out.</p>
<p>Again, they shift our biology</p>
<p>in a general thematic direction.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t change one thing.</p>
<p>They change a variety of things that bias us</p>
<p>toward or away from certain psychological</p>
<p>and behavioral outcomes,</p>
<p>and the various things that we can do</p>
<p>in order to offset them.</p>
<p>We described those earlier</p>
<p>in terms of trying to keep cortisol low</p>
<p>by getting sufficient sunlight,</p>
<p>regardless of time of year,</p>
<p>and regardless of whether or not you happen</p>
<p>to have this particular genetic variant.</p>
<p>So earlier, I talked about how it is testosterone</p>
<p>converted into estrogen that&rsquo;s activating aggression</p>
<p>in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself.</p>
<p>However, there are some studies carried out in humans</p>
<p>that have evaluated the effects of testosterone</p>
<p>and how levels of testosterone correlate</p>
<p>with aggressiveness in the short term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to detail a few of those studies</p>
<p>because I think they are interesting and important.</p>
<p>First of all, there is a study that has explored</p>
<p>levels of testosterone in men of different professions.</p>
<p>Now, before I tell you the data,</p>
<p>I want to be very clear here.</p>
<p>With a study such as this,</p>
<p>one never knows whether or not these men</p>
<p>went into a particular profession</p>
<p>because they had a testosterone level of a given value</p>
<p>or whether or not the work itself</p>
<p>altered their testosterone levels or both.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s fair to assume that it&rsquo;s probably both.</p>
<p>So be very careful in assuming that</p>
<p>a given testosterone level</p>
<p>is causal for choosing a particular career</p>
<p>or that a particular career is causal</p>
<p>for creating a particular testosterone level.</p>
<p>This study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure,</p>
<p>which to be fair, is not the best way to measure testosterone</p>
<p>typically blood draw would be the best way</p>
<p>to measure testosterone.</p>
<p>But nonetheless,</p>
<p>provided the appropriate methods are used,</p>
<p>salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure</p>
<p>of testosterone.</p>
<p>The different occupations that were looked at were,</p>
<p>and here they just looked at men in this particular study</p>
<p>were ministers, salesmen,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t say what particular types of salesmen,</p>
<p>firemen, professors of all things,</p>
<p>physicians and NFL players.</p>
<p>And what they discovered was that the testosterone levels</p>
<p>were essentially in that order from low to highest.</p>
<p>So minister, salesman, fireman, professor,</p>
<p>physician, NFL player.</p>
<p>Now we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes</p>
<p>and all the different features of each of these jobs.</p>
<p>For instance, we don&rsquo;t know whether or not</p>
<p>the fact that the firemen happened,</p>
<p>at least in this study to have lower testosterone levels</p>
<p>on average than the professors or the physicians</p>
<p>was because firemen have lower testosterone levels</p>
<p>or because they have a much more stressful job</p>
<p>and their cortisol levels are higher</p>
<p>than the professor or the physician</p>
<p>and cortisol and testosterone,</p>
<p>not always, but generally are in somewhat antagonistic</p>
<p>push-pull mode because they derive</p>
<p>from the same precursor, et cetera.</p>
<p>Typically when cortisol is high,</p>
<p>testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s causing these effects.</p>
<p>And again, this is just one study and just six occupations,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s relatively interesting</p>
<p>given the fact that each of these professions</p>
<p>involves different levels of competitiveness, right?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t necessarily just want to think about</p>
<p>the level of physical exertion that&rsquo;s required,</p>
<p>but also the level of competitiveness</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s known that competitive interactions</p>
<p>can cause increases in testosterone,</p>
<p>in particular in the winners of competitive interactions,</p>
<p>a topic for a future podcast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed also again,</p>
<p>salivary testosterone in prisoners,</p>
<p>in this case, female prisoners.</p>
<p>So these are incarcerated individuals</p>
<p>have looked at levels of testosterone</p>
<p>according to whether or not</p>
<p>the person committed a nonviolent or a violent crime</p>
<p>in order to arrive in prison</p>
<p>and higher levels of salivary testosterone</p>
<p>were related to those that had arrived in prison</p>
<p>because of conviction of a violent crime</p>
<p>as opposed to a nonviolent crime.</p>
<p>Likewise, when they analyzed prison rule violations,</p>
<p>so an indirect measure of aggressiveness,</p>
<p>but in this case it was strongly associated</p>
<p>with aggressiveness because they knew</p>
<p>what the violations were.</p>
<p>They found were for prisoners that had none,</p>
<p>no prison violations, prison rule violations,</p>
<p>I should say their testosterone levels</p>
<p>tended to be lower than the testosterone levels</p>
<p>of women that had some, even one</p>
<p>or more aggressive violations of prison rules.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide links to these studies in the show notes</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to go into them further.</p>
<p>Obviously studies like this need to be taken</p>
<p>with a grain of salt</p>
<p>because there are so many different factors,</p>
<p>different prisons have different degrees of violence</p>
<p>to begin with and competitiveness to begin with.</p>
<p>But just as a final pass at examining the role</p>
<p>between testosterone and aggressiveness,</p>
<p>there was a very interesting study from Gotts et al,</p>
<p>G-O-E-T-Z, published in 2014,</p>
<p>that looked at serum,</p>
<p>so in this case blood levels of testosterone,</p>
<p>30 minutes after application of a gel-based testosterone</p>
<p>that goes transdermal,</p>
<p>so that the testosterone can go very quickly</p>
<p>into the bloodstream and then did brain imaging</p>
<p>to evaluate the activity of neurons</p>
<p>in the so-called cortical medial amygdala.</p>
<p>The medial amygdala is one of the areas</p>
<p>of the amygdala complex, as we call it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s complex, it&rsquo;s got a lot of different nuclei.</p>
<p>You now know what nuclei are, little clusters of neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a lot of different ones,</p>
<p>but that medial and that cortical medial amygdala</p>
<p>in particular is known to be associated</p>
<p>with aggressive type behaviors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s linked up with, it&rsquo;s part of the larger circuit</p>
<p>that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>and other brain areas that we referred to earlier,</p>
<p>such as the PAG.</p>
<p>What is remarkable about this study</p>
<p>is that it showed that just 30 minutes</p>
<p>after application of this so-called androgel,</p>
<p>this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>there was a significant increase in, of course,</p>
<p>testosterone and cortical medial amygdala activation.</p>
<p>So testosterone can have acute effects,</p>
<p>immediate effects on the pathways related to aggression.</p>
<p>And I think this is something that&rsquo;s not often discussed</p>
<p>because many of the effects of steroid hormones</p>
<p>like testosterone and estrogen are very slow acting.</p>
<p>In fact, steroid hormones,</p>
<p>because they have a certain biochemical composition,</p>
<p>can actually pass through the membranes of cells,</p>
<p>so the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell</p>
<p>and change gene expression in the cell.</p>
<p>Think about puberty, the kid that goes home for the summer</p>
<p>and then comes back looking completely different.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because of a lot of genes got turned on</p>
<p>by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>But the steroid hormones</p>
<p>can also have very fast acting effects.</p>
<p>And with testosterone in particular,</p>
<p>those can be remarkably fast acting.</p>
<p>And one of the most apparent</p>
<p>and well-documented fast acting effects is this effect,</p>
<p>the ability to activate cells within the amygdala.</p>
<p>So you might say,</p>
<p>well, I thought the amygdala was associated with fear.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t testosterone then cause fear?</p>
<p>No, it turns out that the amygdala harbors both cortisol,</p>
<p>corticosterone receptors, and testosterone receptors,</p>
<p>and they each adjust the activity</p>
<p>in the amygdala differently,</p>
<p>such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry</p>
<p>for inducing states of mind and body</p>
<p>that are more action-based.</p>
<p>And indeed, in animals and in humans,</p>
<p>testosterone application and activation</p>
<p>of this corticomedial amygdala pathway</p>
<p>will make animals and humans lean into effort.</p>
<p>This is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good</p>
<p>or at least biases the organism</p>
<p>toward leaning into challenge.</p>
<p>So if you recall, there&rsquo;s not just one type of aggression.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reactive aggression,</p>
<p>which is triggered when one is confronted with something</p>
<p>that sometimes is inevitable, right?</p>
<p>One needs to fight for their life</p>
<p>or for somebody else&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>but also proactive aggression.</p>
<p>And proactive aggression involves activation</p>
<p>of those GO pathways in the basal ganglia</p>
<p>and a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state</p>
<p>one happens to be in to begin with.</p>
<p>And so this is very important</p>
<p>because it points to the fact that yes,</p>
<p>estrogen is activating aggression pathways</p>
<p>that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very likely the case that testosterone</p>
<p>is acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind and body</p>
<p>toward those that will lead to aggression.</p>
<p>Again, aggression is not like a switch on and off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p>
<p>Remember that hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>that Conrad Lorenz hypothesized?</p>
<p>Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure</p>
<p>toward an aggressive episode</p>
<p>and then estrogen actually triggering</p>
<p>that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So if somebody tells you that testosterone,</p>
<p>endogenous or exogenous makes people aggressive,</p>
<p>tell them no.</p>
<p>Testosterone tends to make people lean into effort.</p>
<p>And if that effort involves being aggressive,</p>
<p>either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive,</p>
<p>well, then it will indeed lead to aggression,</p>
<p>but the actual aggression itself</p>
<p>is triggered by estrogen, not testosterone.</p>
<p>Now, thus far, we really haven&rsquo;t talked too much</p>
<p>about the social context in which aggression occurs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because there is a near infinite,</p>
<p>if not infinite number of variables</p>
<p>that will determine that.</p>
<p>So for instance, violent aggression</p>
<p>is entirely appropriate at a professional boxing match,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s occurring inside the ring</p>
<p>and only between the competitors</p>
<p>and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, there are some things</p>
<p>that tend to bias certain social contexts</p>
<p>toward being more aggressive or less aggressive</p>
<p>and not always physical aggression.</p>
<p>And those generally come in two forms</p>
<p>that many of you are familiar with,</p>
<p>which are alcohol and caffeine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss caffeine first.</p>
<p>Why would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity?</p>
<p>Well, the general effects of caffeine</p>
<p>are to increase autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>the activity of the so-called sympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is, to put it very much in plain language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the alertness arm of your nervous system.</p>
<p>That is, it creates a sense of readiness</p>
<p>in your brain and body,</p>
<p>and it does so by activating</p>
<p>the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.</p>
<p>Again, as I always remind people,</p>
<p>sympa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy.</p>
<p>Sympa means together or all at once.</p>
<p>And caffeine tends to bias our brain and body</p>
<p>to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,</p>
<p>which run from about the base of your neck</p>
<p>until the top of your pelvis,</p>
<p>and deploy a bunch of chemicals</p>
<p>that jut out into the rest of your body,</p>
<p>activate adrenaline release.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a parallel increase of adrenaline in your brain,</p>
<p>creating the state of alertness and readiness.</p>
<p>That state of alertness and readiness</p>
<p>can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression.</p>
<p>However, when we are in a state</p>
<p>of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert,</p>
<p>such as after drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>we will bias all those brain and body systems,</p>
<p>the hormones, the chemicals, et cetera,</p>
<p>that exist toward action as opposed to inaction.</p>
<p>So put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity.</p>
<p>No surprise there.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of things,</p>
<p>alcohol tends to decrease activity</p>
<p>in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>tends to make us feel less alert.</p>
<p>Now, initially it can create a state of alertness</p>
<p>because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain.</p>
<p>Our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular</p>
<p>has what&rsquo;s called top-down inhibition.</p>
<p>It exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect</p>
<p>on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>such as the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain</p>
<p>is able to rationalize and think clearly</p>
<p>and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling you, don&rsquo;t say that mean thing,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that violent thing, et cetera.</p>
<p>Alcohol initially tends to increase our level</p>
<p>of overall activity by reducing inhibition,</p>
<p>not just in that forebrain circuit,</p>
<p>but in other circuits, tends to make us more active.</p>
<p>We tend to talk more than we normally would,</p>
<p>move more than we normally would,</p>
<p>but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative</p>
<p>by way of reducing activity in the forebrain,</p>
<p>releasing some of the deeper brain circuits</p>
<p>that are involved in impulsivity,</p>
<p>but also causing a somewhat sedative effect.</p>
<p>And then of course, as alcohol levels increase even further,</p>
<p>people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ve got with alcohol and caffeine</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve got two opposite ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Caffeine increasing arousal and readiness</p>
<p>and the tendency for impulsivity,</p>
<p>and alcohol also increasing impulsivity,</p>
<p>but through a different mechanism.</p>
<p>A really interesting study,</p>
<p>and I should just mention that the title of the study</p>
<p>is Caffeinated and Non-Caffeinated Alcohol Use</p>
<p>and Indirect Aggression and the Impact of Self-Regulation.</p>
<p>So the title is almost self-explanatory.</p>
<p>This was a paper published in the Journal</p>
<p>of Addictive Behavior in 2016,</p>
<p>examining how ingestion of alcohol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s either caffeinated or non-caffeinated alcohol drinks</p>
<p>impacted what they call indirect aggression.</p>
<p>And just to remind you what indirect aggression is,</p>
<p>these are not physical acts of aggression.</p>
<p>These are verbal acts of aggression.</p>
<p>So embarrassing others,</p>
<p>or otherwise somehow trying to reduce</p>
<p>the wellbeing of others by saying certain things,</p>
<p>in particular, in groups.</p>
<p>This study examined both males and females.</p>
<p>This was done by way of a college campus study.</p>
<p>Subjects were 18 to 47 years old.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s some older students on that campus,</p>
<p>or maybe they use some non-students,</p>
<p>but these days you&rsquo;ve also got some students</p>
<p>that are in their 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>So they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included,</p>
<p>fairly broad racial background as well,</p>
<p>included not at equal numbers,</p>
<p>but at least they included a pretty broad spectrum</p>
<p>of people with different backgrounds.</p>
<p>They looked in particular at people</p>
<p>that ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks</p>
<p>at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week.</p>
<p>Okay, again, as a college campus,</p>
<p>not that I encourage that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of these people that I&rsquo;ve never really liked</p>
<p>drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>And since we&rsquo;re fortunate in that way,</p>
<p>I can drink or not drink and tend to not drink.</p>
<p>But so to me, 9.18 drinks per week sounds like a lot,</p>
<p>but I know for some people that might actually be typical.</p>
<p>And then others who were drinking</p>
<p>at least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week.</p>
<p>And those individuals end as high, I should say,</p>
<p>as 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week.</p>
<p>So this would be energy drinks</p>
<p>combined typically with hard alcohol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fairly commonly available in bars and so forth.</p>
<p>And some individuals drank as much as, goodness,</p>
<p>20.36 alcoholic drinks per week total.</p>
<p>Some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated.</p>
<p>The basic outcome of this study was that the more alcohol</p>
<p>someone tended to consume,</p>
<p>the more likely it was that they would engage</p>
<p>in these indirect aggressive type behaviors.</p>
<p>And in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages,</p>
<p>there, the effect was especially interesting.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m just going to paraphrase</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll actually read from the study.</p>
<p>Quote, with regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use,</p>
<p>our findings indicated that heavier</p>
<p>caffeinated alcohol beverage use</p>
<p>was associated positively with indirect aggression,</p>
<p>even after considering one&rsquo;s typical alcohol use</p>
<p>and dispositional aggression.</p>
<p>What this means is that even though alcohol</p>
<p>can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive,</p>
<p>and even though certain individuals</p>
<p>already have a disposition toward being more aggressive,</p>
<p>there was an effect that was independent,</p>
<p>meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition,</p>
<p>meaning if someone was consuming</p>
<p>caffeinated alcoholic beverages,</p>
<p>they had a particularly high likelihood</p>
<p>of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Now, this makes perfect sense in light of the model</p>
<p>they propose, which is this self-regulation model</p>
<p>that basically self-regulation involves several things.</p>
<p>It involves engaging in certain behaviors</p>
<p>and suppressing other behaviors.</p>
<p>So as described before,</p>
<p>because alcohol tends to have a sedative,</p>
<p>suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>at least after the initial period,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to tend to reduce the likelihood</p>
<p>that people will engage in any type of behavior,</p>
<p>whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and increase the likelihood that someone will engage</p>
<p>in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise.</p>
<p>So the combination of caffeine and alcohol</p>
<p>is really acting as a two-prong system</p>
<p>to bias people towards more impulsivity,</p>
<p>that is less self-regulation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really yanking your volitional control,</p>
<p>your ability to engage in prefrontal top-down inhibition</p>
<p>over your hypothalamus</p>
<p>from two distinct and specific circuits.</p>
<p>By now, you should be getting the impression</p>
<p>that self-regulation is a key feature</p>
<p>of whether or not somebody, maybe even you,</p>
<p>is going to engage in aggressive speech</p>
<p>or aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked about a number of tools</p>
<p>that one can use to reduce the probability</p>
<p>that that will happen.</p>
<p>I suppose if the context were appropriate,</p>
<p>you could even take those tool recommendations</p>
<p>and just invert them and increase the likelihood</p>
<p>that aggressiveness would happen.</p>
<p>But regardless, self-regulation is key.</p>
<p>And in light of that,</p>
<p>I want to share with you a study that&rsquo;s focused on kids,</p>
<p>but that has important ramifications for adults as well.</p>
<p>As you probably are already aware,</p>
<p>there are many kids out there that suffer</p>
<p>from so-called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.</p>
<p>There are also many adults we are finding</p>
<p>that are suffering from ADHD.</p>
<p>And there is also an epidemic, I would say,</p>
<p>of people that are concerned</p>
<p>about whether or not they have ADHD.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not they have true clinical ADHD or not</p>
<p>is not clear.</p>
<p>We did an episode all about ADHD</p>
<p>and tools for ADHD.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to check out that episode</p>
<p>and some of the diagnostic criteria.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity,</p>
<p>you can find that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>As this study I&rsquo;m about to share with you aptly points out,</p>
<p>there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD.</p>
<p>Whether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance</p>
<p>on a number of different cognitive tests</p>
<p>and behavioral tests and self-report.</p>
<p>In any event, the study I&rsquo;m about to share with you</p>
<p>explored how a particular pattern of supplementation</p>
<p>in kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes</p>
<p>and impulsivity and increase self-regulation.</p>
<p>And the title of the study is,</p>
<p>efficacy of carnitine in the treatment of children</p>
<p>with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p>Even though they put carnitine in the title,</p>
<p>that what they focused on was whether or not</p>
<p>acetyl L-carnitine supplementation</p>
<p>could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency</p>
<p>of these kids with ADHD.</p>
<p>And to make a long story short, indeed, it did.</p>
<p>There was a very significant effect</p>
<p>of acetyl carnitine supplementation</p>
<p>on improving some of the symptomology of ADHD.</p>
<p>A few details about the study</p>
<p>that might be relevant to you.</p>
<p>This was a randomized double blind placebo controlled</p>
<p>double crossover study.</p>
<p>This was done as an outpatient study.</p>
<p>So the kids weren&rsquo;t in a hospital,</p>
<p>they were living out in the world.</p>
<p>This again was done on younger kids.</p>
<p>So this was six to 13 year old kids</p>
<p>that were diagnosed with ADHD.</p>
<p>They received either acetyl L-carnitine or placebo.</p>
<p>And they did all the good practice stuff</p>
<p>that good researchers do of making sure that the placebo</p>
<p>and the acetyl L-carnitine had similar look and taste.</p>
<p>It was consumed twice daily after meals.</p>
<p>Now she just mentioned that acetyl L-carnitine</p>
<p>typically is taken in capsule form</p>
<p>or occasionally an injectable form here.</p>
<p>They were using this as a drink,</p>
<p>which is essentially the same as capsule form,</p>
<p>but the powder is just going directly into liquid.</p>
<p>And the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing this according to the body weight</p>
<p>of these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day.</p>
<p>The quantity of the medication was supplied.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m reading for a period of eight weeks</p>
<p>and every eight weeks,</p>
<p>a new quantity of medication was supplied.</p>
<p>So basically this is a fairly long-term study</p>
<p>exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes</p>
<p>in week eight, 16, and 24.</p>
<p>They also looked at things that you could only get</p>
<p>through a blood draw.</p>
<p>So things like hemoglobin, hematocrit,</p>
<p>red blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera.</p>
<p>These are kids and even if it were adults,</p>
<p>they were quite appropriately examining</p>
<p>a lot of the physiological measures</p>
<p>that one would want to carry out to make sure,</p>
<p>first of all, that blood levels of carnitine are increasing</p>
<p>and indeed they confirm that,</p>
<p>but also that no negative effects are showing up</p>
<p>in the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids.</p>
<p>So first I&rsquo;ll just tell you the basic outcome of the study,</p>
<p>which was, here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>given twice daily, carnitine appeared to be effective</p>
<p>and well-tolerated treatment</p>
<p>for a group of children with ADHD.</p>
<p>They showed significantly abnormal behavior</p>
<p>compared to these other boys.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m moving to the table of results.</p>
<p>They showed significant reductions</p>
<p>in their so-called total problem score.</p>
<p>The total problem score is a well-established measure</p>
<p>of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.</p>
<p>And I should say adults with ADHD</p>
<p>has to do with challenges in social</p>
<p>and learning environments</p>
<p>and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform.</p>
<p>Reductions in attentional problems overall,</p>
<p>reductions in delinquency,</p>
<p>and most important for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>significant reductions in aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s especially nice about this study, I think,</p>
<p>is that even though it was a relatively small number</p>
<p>of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated</p>
<p>in other studies and other laboratories,</p>
<p>that they were able to confirm the shifts in L-carnitine</p>
<p>within the bloodstream of these kids.</p>
<p>That is, they were able to correlate the physiology</p>
<p>with the psychological changes.</p>
<p>You know, in studies like this,</p>
<p>and frankly, in all studies of human pharmacology,</p>
<p>you have to worry about effects that show up,</p>
<p>not just because of placebo effects,</p>
<p>but because of so-called off-target effects</p>
<p>or related things totally independent of the drug</p>
<p>or the particular supplement</p>
<p>that you happen to be looking at.</p>
<p>To put it in the words of a great neuroscientist,</p>
<p>unfortunately, he passed away some years ago,</p>
<p>but he was a member of the National Academy,</p>
<p>extremely accomplished neuroscientist,</p>
<p>once turned to me and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never forget, a drug is a substance</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;that when injected into an animal or a human being,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;creates a paper.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug</p>
<p>or any supplement in most all conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is in cases such as this study</p>
<p>where you can quite convincingly see</p>
<p>that the particular feature of physiology</p>
<p>that you expected to change actually changed,</p>
<p>and you see a psychological outcome</p>
<p>that you can gain much greater confidence</p>
<p>that the changes in delinquency,</p>
<p>in this case, reduced delinquency, improved attention,</p>
<p>reduced aggressiveness, and so forth,</p>
<p>was at least somehow related to the shift</p>
<p>in blood physiology and levels of L-carnitine</p>
<p>or acetyl L-carnitine and carnitine</p>
<p>in the bloodstream of these children,</p>
<p>as opposed to something else,</p>
<p>like L-carnitine going and affecting</p>
<p>some downstream target that you have no knowledge of.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that&rsquo;s still entirely possible,</p>
<p>but I think studies such as these increase our confidence</p>
<p>that things like L-carnitine can be used,</p>
<p>perhaps in concert with things</p>
<p>like omega-3 supplementation,</p>
<p>diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan</p>
<p>and therefore more serotonin,</p>
<p>obviously avoiding things like alcohol,</p>
<p>and as it appears from the study I just described,</p>
<p>reducing one&rsquo;s intake</p>
<p>or not consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages,</p>
<p>seems like it would be a good idea</p>
<p>if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness,</p>
<p>to think about the hormone context</p>
<p>and whether or not you tend to have</p>
<p>higher testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>or lower testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>maybe even think about the work environment,</p>
<p>whether or not you are existing</p>
<p>in a particularly competitive work environment</p>
<p>and even daylight, time of year,</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re getting sufficient sunlight,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re avoiding light</p>
<p>in the evening and so on.</p>
<p>So studies such as this, I think are useful</p>
<p>because they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever,</p>
<p>will there be one supplement or one nutritional change</p>
<p>or even one behavioral change</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to completely shift an individual</p>
<p>from being aggressive and impulsive,</p>
<p>but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens,</p>
<p>by paying attention to things like time of year</p>
<p>and work conditions and school conditions</p>
<p>and overall levels of stress</p>
<p>and likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera,</p>
<p>that you can use behaviors, diet, and supplementation</p>
<p>as a way to shift that overall internal milieu</p>
<p>from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s been called throughout the episode,</p>
<p>toward aggressive impulsivity</p>
<p>and relax some of that hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>and reduce aggressive tendencies.</p>
<p>So once again, and frankly, as always,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done a deep dive into the neurobiology</p>
<p>and the psychology of what I believe</p>
<p>to be an important feature of our lives,</p>
<p>in this case, aggression.</p>
<p>I want to point out that in a episode</p>
<p>in the not too distant future,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson</p>
<p>from Caltech University,</p>
<p>who is the world expert on the neurobiology</p>
<p>of aggression.</p>
<p>In fact, he is the senior author on many of the studies</p>
<p>related to the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>that I discussed today.</p>
<p>Our discussion will touch on aggression, of course.</p>
<p>So hearing today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>will help you digest that information,</p>
<p>but we are also going to talk about other emotional states.</p>
<p>He is an expert, not just in aggression,</p>
<p>but in motivated states related to sex and mating behavior,</p>
<p>social relationships of all kinds,</p>
<p>and how those relate not just to biology and psychology,</p>
<p>but also certain forms of pathology,</p>
<p>things like PTSD and the relationship, for instance,</p>
<p>between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression,</p>
<p>and many other important topics that I know many of you,</p>
<p>if not all of you, will be interested in.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I want to point you</p>
<p>to his recently released and wonderful book</p>
<p>entitled, The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.</p>
<p>And again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful book.</p>
<p>It serves as a tremendous introduction</p>
<p>to the history of the study of these areas,</p>
<p>the current science and discoveries</p>
<p>being made in these areas,</p>
<p>all made accessible to the scientists</p>
<p>and non-scientists alike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very engaging read,</p>
<p>and so much so that even though he was gracious</p>
<p>in sending me a copy, I also purchased myself a copy</p>
<p>to give to somebody who is a therapist,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve purchased another copy</p>
<p>to give to a high school kid that I mentor</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very interested</p>
<p>in the neuroscience of emotions.</p>
<p>And I think we are all interested in emotions,</p>
<p>not just fear and some of these negative states,</p>
<p>not just aggression,</p>
<p>but also the positive emotions of our lives.</p>
<p>And so, The Nature of the Beast,</p>
<p>How Emotions Guide Us by David Anderson</p>
<p>is a wonderful read.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s episode and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving the transition time</p>
<p>and the quality of your sleep</p>
<p>and improving alertness and focus and so on.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re considering taking supplements,</p>
<p>there are several key considerations.</p>
<p>First of all, those supplements should be</p>
<p>of the very highest quality,</p>
<p>and you want to make sure that what&rsquo;s listed on the bottle</p>
<p>is actually what&rsquo;s in the bottle,</p>
<p>which is a problem for many supplement companies out there.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is pleased to announce</p>
<p>that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because we believe Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>to be of the very highest quality</p>
<p>of any supplements out there,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been working very closely with them</p>
<p>in order to direct them to create supplements</p>
<p>that are individual ingredient supplements</p>
<p>of the particular quality and sources</p>
<p>that we would like to see and that relate to the science</p>
<p>and studies covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see some of those supplements,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and there you will see some of the supplements</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast before,</p>
<p>such as magnesium threonate for augmenting sleep,</p>
<p>things like L-tyrosine for augmenting dopamine,</p>
<p>and things like L-carnitine,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve discussed on today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Right now, the list of supplements</p>
<p>and the products that are there is only partial</p>
<p>to what will soon be included in the future,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s an ever-expanding catalog of, again,</p>
<p>what we believe to be the very highest quality supplements</p>
<p>available to you.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested in behavioral,</p>
<p>nutritional, and supplementation-based tools</p>
<p>for neuroscience and other aspects of your biology</p>
<p>that impact your health and performance,</p>
<p>we have a newsletter.</p>
<p>It is a zero-cost newsletter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>You can go to hubermanlab.com, and there in the menu,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find the Neural Network Newsletter.</p>
<p>Sign up.</p>
<p>You can just put your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody else.</p>
<p>You will also find examples of the newsletter</p>
<p>that you can download right away</p>
<p>without having to sign up and decide</p>
<p>if signing up is right for you.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not already following us</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram,</p>
<p>we are Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter,</p>
<p>and at both places,</p>
<p>I describe science and science-based tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlaps with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct</p>
<p>from the content of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for joining me</p>
<p>for our discussion about the biology, psychology,</p>
<p>and actionable tools around aggression,</p>
<p>and as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
