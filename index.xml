        <description>It&amp;rsquo;s like reading my mind.
It&amp;rsquo;s magic.
We&amp;rsquo;re innovating
at a scale like never before.
It takes what you prompt it with
and just runs with it.
Everything is linked.
Everything is easy to use.
We&amp;rsquo;re accelerating how fast we can deliver
solutions to our fans, to our business.
It takes the hands-on time
that the provider has to spend
with the computer
and puts that time back with the patient.</description>

        <description>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company created ChatGPT, was one of three artificial intelligence
experts to testify on oversight of the swiftly developing technology at a Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee hearing.
Mr. Altman stated that AI could, quote, cause significant harm to the world.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the rest of that hearing.
Welcome to the hearing of the Privacy, Technology, and the Law Subcommittee.

        <description>Congratulations on making it to the end of this short course.
In summary, in this short course you&amp;rsquo;ve
learned about two key principles for prompting. Write
clear and specific instructions, and when it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate, give the
model time to think. You also learned about iterative
prompt development and how having a
process to get to the prompt that&amp;rsquo;s right for
your application is key. And we went through a few capabilities of large</description>

        <description>One of the exciting things about a large
language model is you can use it to build a custom chatbot
with only a modest amount of effort. ChatGPT, the web interface,
is a way for you to have a conversational interface,
a conversation via a large language model. But one of the
cool things is you can also use a large language model to
build your custom chatbot to maybe play the role of an AI</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3001800007/</guid>
        <description>Expanding is the task of taking a short piece of text,
such as a set of instructions or a list of topics,
and having the large language model generate a
longer piece of text, such as an email or
an essay about some topic. There are some great uses of this,
such as if you use a large language model as a brainstorming partner.
But I just also want to acknowledge that</description>

        <description>Large language models are very good at transforming its input to a
different format, such as inputting a
piece of text in one language and transforming
it or translating it to a different language,
or helping with spelling and grammar corrections,
so taking as input a piece of text that may not be
fully grammatical and helping you to fix that up a bit,
or even transforming formats such as inputting HTML and</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/3001800005/</guid>
        <description>This next video is on inferring. I like to think
of these tasks where the model takes a text as input and
performs some kind of analysis. So this could be extracting labels,
extracting names, kind of understanding the
sentiment of a text, that kind of thing.
So if you want to extract a sentiment, positive or negative,
with a piece of text, in the traditional
machine learning workflow, you&amp;rsquo;d have to collect the label data set, train</description>

        <description>There&amp;rsquo;s so much text in today&amp;rsquo;s world, pretty much none of us have
enough time to read all the things we wish we had time to. So one
of the most exciting applications I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of
large language models is to use it to
summarise text. And this is something that I&amp;rsquo;m seeing multiple teams
build into multiple software applications. You can do this
in the Chat GPT Web Interface. I do this all</description>

        <description>When I&amp;rsquo;ve been building applications with
large language models, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever come to the prompt that
I ended up using in the final application on my first attempt.
And this isn&amp;rsquo;t what matters. As long as you have a good process
to iteratively make your prompt better, then you&amp;rsquo;ll
be able to come to something that works
well for the task you want to achieve.
You may have heard me say that when I train a machine learning model,</description>

        <description>Welcome to this course on ChatGPT prompt engineering
for developers. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to have with
me Isa Fulford to teach this along with me. She
is a member of the technical staff of
OpenAI and had built the popular ChatGPT
retrieval plugin and a large part of the work has been teaching
people how to use LLM or large language
model technology in products. She&amp;rsquo;s also contributed to the
OpenAI cookbook that teaches people prompting.</description>

So you don&amp;rsquo;t feel well today, huh?
No.
I cannot kick this.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with this sickness.
So, listener, if you notice that Pumps is hacking and sounds a little ill, she&amp;rsquo;s under
the weather.
But we are going to push through because that&amp;rsquo;s how dedicated we are on this podcast journey

Yeah.
You could do a little shimmy afterwards.

Like we sit down to watch a movie and we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a vibration, like an earthquake
of everybody&amp;rsquo;s phone, like, and it&amp;rsquo;s all that fucking Snapchat.

        <description>BILL GATES: It was stunning, it was mind blowing. After the biology question I had them type in, “What do you say to a father with a sick child?” And it gave this very careful, excellent answer that was perhaps better than any of us in the room might have given. And so, it was like, wow, what is it – what is the scope of this thing? Because this is way better.</description>

of information, but we knew that this was a case that still had to be told.
Cases like this are often hard for us to tell because there&amp;rsquo;s not always a lot to the investigation</description>

        <description>Jensen, thank you so much for being here today.
And I want to get started just with a question that is
really basic, but I think chips have been in the
ecosystem a lot more lately, and there&amp;rsquo;s people
who probably didn&amp;rsquo;t even really know what a
semiconductor was a few years ago.
Can you give me a very basic definition of what
Nvidia is?
Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s an easy question.</description>

An incision is made on his wrist, an artery exposed.

        <description>Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don′t know what&amp;rsquo;s lost ′til you find it
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin&amp;rsquo; for us to do
We don&amp;rsquo;t really like what′s on the news, but it′s on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin&amp;rsquo; someone else′s name
I remember back at Jonny&amp;rsquo;s place, it′s not the same anymore</description>

        <description>Boyfriends
They think you′re so easy
They take you for granted
They don&amp;rsquo;t know they′re just misunderstanding
You
You, you&amp;rsquo;re back at it again
Weakened
When you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he&amp;rsquo;s thinking
You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door
You′re no closer to him
Now you′re halfway home</description>

Maple syrup, coffee
Pancakes for two
Hash brown, egg yolk
I will always love you

Ooh-ooh
Stay until the morning
&amp;lsquo;Cause, baby, loving you′s the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

And you&amp;rsquo;re trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing about the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming ′til now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family, &amp;lsquo;cause they never showed you love</description>

You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze, crystal ball
Somehow, you′ve become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
I was thinkin&amp;rsquo; about who you are
Your delicate point of view, I
Was thinkin′ about you
I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about where you are

I was nose-bleeding, looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope, you were just doing cocaine
In my kitchen, you never listen, I hope you′re missing me by now
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You&amp;rsquo;d be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)</description>

Holding me back
Gravity′s holding me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don&amp;rsquo;t we leave it at that?
Nothing to say
When everything gets in the way

I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There′s never been someone who&amp;rsquo;s so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
&amp;ldquo;Give me something old and red&amp;rdquo;
I pay for it more than I did back then

        <description>We met each other on the neon dinghy
Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beam down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
In the sky, we could see the riders on horseback
On comets, coming toward us, kicking up with laughter
My friend, Big Twitchy, rode the boat into the light
Surfed the NorthBreak
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy, ′cause that&amp;rsquo;s all we knew</description>

        <description>I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards
Smoke Cuban cigars and get kicked out of bars before two
But only if it′s with you
I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it&amp;rsquo;s with you
I got some baggage, let′s do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage</description>

I′m driving around town in a beat up old Mercedes
You think I&amp;rsquo;m crazy
You might be right
But when he smiles, I don′t care about the past
Just like that
I told myself I closed that door, but I&amp;rsquo;m right back here again
I know half of what I&amp;rsquo;m saying don′t make no sense,
So don′t ask me where I been
I&amp;rsquo;m not always right
But still I ain′t got time for what went wrong</description>

Like sticky sweet lemonade
Never wanna leave this room
Daydream, déjà vu
If I had control over you
We could stay like this forever, lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds, fallin′ stupid like we&amp;rsquo;re kids

Now I&amp;rsquo;ve had time to think it over
We′re much older and the bone&amp;rsquo;s too big to bury
Oh, isn&amp;rsquo;t it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to hell, but we never came back
I′m sorry that you′re jaded

        <description>As of last summer, authorities have Ron Hulse&amp;rsquo;s DNA swab.
They agreed to do a direct comparison test against the partial male profile found on Darlene&amp;rsquo;s blouse.
Not because Ron is a suspect, but because he&amp;rsquo;s her husband.
If that DNA belongs to Ron, then it actually means the profile is kind of useless.
Maybe it was from their hug goodbye that morning when he went to work,
in which case it means that we need to start testing other items while we still can to get a suspect sample.</description>

        <description>For almost four decades, no one questioned Darlene&amp;rsquo;s cause of death.
And honestly, at first, neither did we.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t set out to debunk the cause of death in Darlene&amp;rsquo;s case, but when we went
through the pathologist&amp;rsquo;s 1984 findings, a few things just didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that we thought the report was wrong or that we knew more than a trained
pathologist.
In fact, it was the opposite.</description>

        <description>When we made the discovery about the Parson family,
it made us question everything Nelson had told us so far.
And again, Lemon and Parson are pseudonyms
because these guys have never publicly been named suspects by law enforcement.
So to see if this was just some kind of huge mix-up,
we first reached out to a former employee of Nelson&amp;rsquo;s
who Emily had interviewed prior.
She&amp;rsquo;s actually the one who was assigned to be the liaison</description>

        <description>About a year before we got involved with Darlene&amp;rsquo;s case,
her family worked with a private investigator, Patrick Zirpoli,
who goes by Zip to those who know him.
Zip spent his career with the Pennsylvania State Police.
He retired in 2015 as a corporal and the unit supervisor
of the Criminal Investigation Assessment Unit.
One of his specialties is cold case homicide investigations,
and after retirement, he&amp;rsquo;s gone on to consult in cold cases.</description>

        <description>In any good investigation, you&amp;rsquo;re running down multiple leads at once.
It&amp;rsquo;s not just a time efficiency thing, it&amp;rsquo;s what helps you avoid getting tunnel vision.
So one of the times we met with Nelson, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just Kenneth McCune Jr.&amp;rsquo;s name that
we brought up.
We also asked him about another name.
We said, hey, what do you know about John Paul Clark?
Did your office ever seriously look at him?</description>

        <description>Everyone from the current prosecutor to the FBI back in 87 say the same thing.
Look at where her body was found.
Her killer knew the area, knew where he was going to take her.
If that&amp;rsquo;s true, we decided to see what the land would tell us.
So we pulled the deed records for the lot where Darlene was found, and we looked at
parcels around it.
And sure enough, right up the road is McCune Farms, LLC.</description>

        <description>We&amp;rsquo;re just a mile south of Plymouth on Old 31 headed south to Argus.
Argus is about 15 minutes south of Plymouth, and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just cornfields and backroads
between the two towns.
Once you turn off of New US 31 onto Old Highway 31, you cross some railroad tracks, and a
few miles south of there, you pass right by Brandi Peltz&amp;rsquo;s old house, where she was
murdered in 1986.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt read from Sergeant Dave Yokelet&amp;rsquo;s case summary.
In the past several years, since 1982, this officer has been involved in the investigating
of several violent crimes that have occurred in the extreme southern portion of Marshall
County, Indiana.
Two of those crimes involved homicides, one of which was in 1984, the Hulse Homicide,
the other in 1986, the Peltz Homicide.</description>

        <description>Before moving on to other suspects, whose names were coming in via phone calls and letters
from the public, investigators knew what they had to do next—give Ron Hulse another polygraph
test.
I say another because they actually gave him one just three days after Darlene&amp;rsquo;s abduction,
which he passed.
And listen, Ron was never a suspect.
But back then, officers knew that they had to play offense and defense.</description>

a 29-year-old man named Ricky Mock went into a convenience store
and held the cashiers and guests at gunpoint, demanding money.
When he got what he was looking for, he took off,
only to be pulled over a few hours later
by an Amarillo officer who noticed his Indiana plates.
Ricky assumed that they knew it was him who robbed the place,</description>

hour-long drive from his house in North Manchester, Indiana, to Argus to check out some land that
he&amp;rsquo;d been interested in buying for his timber operations.
This was actually the second time he had driven there to have a look, but he wanted to double
check the trees on the plot before he moved forward with actually buying it.</description>

Everyone&amp;rsquo;s your neighbor, but each house is a corn or soybean field away.
The home of the Hulse family was just like that,
tucked away off a major road through town with fields to the front and back.
Ron Hulse built the home himself for his wife Darlene and their three daughters.</description>

It’s not like that for me. I mean, I don’t mean to be egotistical or anything like that, but at no point in my career have I ever felt as though I were inflicting some kind of discipline on myself.

It’s constantly throwing pandemics at us, and – and natural disasters and entropy, things wearing down, and falling apart and rotting. To the extent that life gets better, it’s only because people have applied their ingenuity to try to make it better. We’ve invented antibiotics and vaccines, and intergovernmental organizations, and liberal democracies.</description>

PETER LEE: What we’re seeing today is that more and more, what we do, and even just to survive as a civilization depends on researchers and scientists being able to get drawn in and solve problems, respond to crises, help us become hopefully more resilient to the future. And that sort of crisis response science, I think, is getting to be incredibly important. And it won’t work if society doesn’t trust what we’re doing.</description>

STEVIE BATHICHE: A big part of invention, engineering, product development is managing complexity, and moving complexity around, in fact. Like, if you think about, high level, what we can do and if you understand the different systems and the different disciplines, you can effectively move complexity around where it’s hard in one area, but not so hard in another area.

DAVID BAKER:
Generally, in engineering and biology, if you want to solve a problem, you go look in nature for a protein that already does something similar, and then you modify it a bit. The relationship between sequence and structure has been really mysterious, but now we can actually design proteins with intent to do new things. So, I think it’s just getting to be very exciting.

KIMBERLY BRYANT: I think we need more organizational support, not just at Black Girls Code, but any organization that’s doing this work as a nonprofit. We can’t do it alone. So for me, it’s always about how can we have this magnified effort of different organizations that are all working collectively to elevate girls in the STEM fields, and particularly in computer science?

psychology, and utility of play.

Much of our childhood development centers around play,</description>

KEVIN SCOTT: I think it’s really important for all of us to sort of share our stories because, you know, there are interesting lessons in there. But maybe most importantly, understanding each other a little bit better shows us how I do honestly believe that we are vastly, vastly more similar than we are different, and that sometimes, these stereotypes that we have of each other are just obstacles that stand in the way of each of us achieving our full potential.</description>

You can’t say, “Hey, you know, look, my car ran you over, it’s an AI car, I don’t know what it did, it’s not my fault, right?” You as the driver or maybe it’s the manufacturer if there’s some malfunction, but people have to be responsible for the behavior of the machines.</description>

about narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy,

to the two remaining questions in her case.

DREW ENDY: We&amp;rsquo;ve inherited this stuff, which is three plus billion years old, going on four billion years old. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty sophisticated. You lift the lid on it and understand how it&amp;rsquo;s working. It&amp;rsquo;s unbelievable, right, the layers of sophistication and the architecture and how things appear to have been selected to perform. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s stunning.

And in that time, he hadn&amp;rsquo;t lost a single fight, but he was about to go toe-to-toe, against Sonny, Liston the heavyweight champion of the world known to many as the most intimidating boxer alive in the weeks leading up to the fight.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Mary Frankie Harvey, the Jack of Hearts from Massachusetts.
Forty-two years have passed since Frankie was left for dead in a southeastern Massachusetts
gravel pit.
Frankie&amp;rsquo;s case is unique in a lot of ways, but one reason is because her story straddles
the state line of Rhode Island, where she was last seen alive, and Massachusetts, where
her body was found, which complicated the investigation from the get-go.</description>

        <description>JUDY ESTRIN: (Voiceover) Right now, so much of what is going on in the industry is driven by the values of scale and speed. It is about maximizing growth. It is about maximizing connectivity. What about thinking about what we&amp;rsquo;re losing in those values. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with growth, but not at the expense of humanity.

investigators searching for her killer for 28 years.

        <description>ANDREW NG: With the rise of technology often comes greater concentration of power in smaller numbers of people&amp;rsquo;s hands, and I think that this creates greater risk of ever-growing wealth inequality as well. To be really candid, I think that with the rise of the last few ways of technology, we actually did a great job creating wealth in the East and the West Coast, but we actually did leave large parts of the country behind, and I would love for this next one to bring everyone along with us.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Jennifer Lynn, the Queen of Hearts from California.
In 1994, the brutal murder of 14-year-old Jenny inside her parents&amp;rsquo; safe suburban
house left a community shaken to its core, because not only had a bright and talented
life been suddenly snuffed out, but police struggled to find a motive.
And the more clues they uncovered, the more investigators realized the nightmare they
were dealing with.</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until about senior year in high school when I realized what I could do with it. I have a little brother, and so I made it so that when he tried to log into the computer, it would just beep really loudly.

It broke my heart when I first heard about what happened to Marjorie and her son,
so even though they&amp;rsquo;re not featured on a cold case card in Colorado,
I knew we had to tell you their story.
And not just because it is so devastating,
but because nearly 50 years have gone by since Marjorie&amp;rsquo;s murder,
and some of the stories surrounding her death are as confusing today as they were back then.</description>

And her abduction, along with some strange happenings that unfolded after, has haunted
the residents of Sunset, Utah for the last 40 years.

People always say, &amp;ldquo;Why you… Why you always walking?&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s my time to kind of reflect on the day or reflect on the day that&amp;rsquo;s ahead of me and just think.

        <description>Gabrielle Union: Depending on what&amp;rsquo;s happening that day, sometimes I need a walk to find clarity. There&amp;rsquo;s challenges that we face that you just can&amp;rsquo;t quite figure out the right approach or the right answer, or you know d*** well what the answer is, but you got to make peace with it. And, for me, fitness, walking, just moving every day in some kind of meaningful way brings me peace.</description>

For some, just right.

On a summer night in 1999, Darwin, a quirky intellectual
who was obsessed with studying spiders,
decided to go out to the bars with some friends
because he had just gotten some amazing news.
But after his final nightcap, Darwin wandered out the side door of a bar
and into a dark alley, triggering a mystery
that no one in 23 years has been able to solve.</description>

It was just like we take that for granted, don&amp;rsquo;t we?

In February 2011, the Phoenix Police Department finally ID&amp;rsquo;d a Jane Doe whose case they&amp;rsquo;d

Investigators have spent the last 11 years since determined to solve her murder.
And their work has led to major breakthroughs in recent years.
And now, some speculate that her tragic ending is connected to three similar crimes.</description>

        <description>Kurt Fearnley: When I go out and take a push, it&amp;rsquo;s like going for a walk. You know, I&amp;rsquo;m in my day chair right now. The day chair is a separate wheelchair. It&amp;rsquo;s the thing that you think of as your walking legs. And for somebody that&amp;rsquo;s never been in a chair, it&amp;rsquo;s just a stroll. It&amp;rsquo;s out here to enjoy the environment, to look around and just have a moment to yourself.</description>

It really changes your body chemistry just to get out into nature and also out of your head so you&amp;rsquo;re not so caught up in thinking the same thoughts over and over again.

        <description>Joan Benoit Samuelson: Well, a walk for me is really downtime, and I know that when I go for a walk with friends, I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes slowing them down because I… I tend to walk slowly. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m taking everything in or because I do so much running that it&amp;rsquo;s nice to change the speed by a huge measure.
​
And it&amp;rsquo;s my opportunity to commune with nature.</description>

like literally seventh best player.
But if you&amp;rsquo;re playing with the other six, you&amp;rsquo;re the sucker.
You are like the worst player in the game, right?
So like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of players, for example,
like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?
He&amp;rsquo;s not a top level player,

        <description>Randall Park: Walking is, for me, just this wonderful gift.
​
During the pandemic, I actually, for the first time in my life, experienced panic attacks. They were really jarring and scary for me. I started incorporating long walks into my life. They really make me feel more relaxed, more in touch with the Earth and the world. And it&amp;rsquo;s something that we all take for granted, including myself, far too often.</description>

Hey everybody, hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a good week. We are just beginning to dry out here in Marin
after weeks and weeks of rain. Speaking of misery, perhaps the biggest story this week is all of the
layoffs that have been taking place. On Wednesday, Microsoft sacked 10,000 employees, roughly 5% of
its workforce. And today, Google&amp;rsquo;s parent company, Alphabet, announced that it is laying off 12,000</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Bobby Joe Fritz,
the five of spades from Wisconsin.
When five-year-old Bobby Joe vanished
one afternoon in the early 80s,
no one suspected right away that he&amp;rsquo;d been abducted
because stuff like that just didn&amp;rsquo;t happen
in his tiny hometown.
But as days went by without any sign of the little boy,
the clues started to point to a worst case scenario
and revealed something much more sinister going on</description>

        <description>Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Walking, for me, represents, first of all, just the chance to feel like I have some control. I live a really busy life, and I think when you feel like you can go take a walk, it kind of… it sends a message, I think, to my whole way of thinking that I&amp;rsquo;ve regained some control. I can go for this walk. So I love that part of it.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a release, a moment to reflect but then also to let go. I think both are so important. I need this time to just, like, listen and to be present and to remember how blessed you are to walk, to breathe, to take another day.</description>

human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just by throwing
more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political problems with military

Massachusetts, one of those damp New England days when all you want to do, is slide out of your wet coat, warm your hands and order a drink at a cozy bar.
This particular bar has a speakeasy Vibe, heavy velvet curtains and dark wood accents, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the first thing you notice.

        <description>Our card this week is Dale Dinwiddie, the Nine of Diamonds from South Carolina.
In 1992, Dale was a 23-year-old woman enjoying a night out with friends when suddenly she
vanished from a crowded club, never to be seen again.
Maybe the right person listening to this episode will change that.
I&amp;rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.
On September 24th, 1992, at 6.15 in the morning, Dan Dinwiddie was just getting out of bed.</description>

        <description>Nick Jonas: Cuando era niño amaba caminar con mi padre. Vivíamos en una casita de ladrillo en Wyckoff, Nueva Jersey, a dos puertas de la iglesia donde mi padre era cura. Y había un camino de vuelta por el bosque cerca de un cementerio. El cementerio me daba un poco de miedo, pero el tiempo que pasé con mi padre caminando por ese camino, hablando de la vida, la música y la creatividad fue un recuerdo favorito mientras crecía.</description>

E havia um caminho de volta pela floresta que continha um cemitério. O cemitério era meio assustador para mim, mas o tempo que passei com meu pai caminhando por esse caminho de volta, falando sobre a vida, música e criatividade foram algumas das minhas memórias favoritas enquanto crescia.</description>

On habitait une petite maison en briques à Wyckoff dans le New Jersey, à deux maisons de l’église où mon père officiait en tant que pasteur. Il y avait un chemin à travers la forêt qui longeait un cimetière. Le cimetière me faisait un peu peur, mais les marches avec mon père sur ce petit chemin où l’on parlait de la vie, de la musique et de la créativité sont parmi les meilleurs souvenirs de mon enfance.</description>

        <description>Nick Jonas: Quando ero piccolo, adoravo andare a camminare con mio padre. Abitavamo in questa casetta di mattoni a Wyckoff, in New Jersey, a due edifici dalla chiesa dove mio padre faceva il pastore. C&amp;rsquo;era questo sentiero sul retro che attraversava il bosco affiancando un cimitero. Il cimitero mi faceva abbastanza paura, ma il tempo trascorso con mio padre a passeggiare lungo questo sentiero, a parlare della vita, di musica e creatività, è uno dei più bei ricordi d&amp;rsquo;infanzia che ho.</description>

We lived at this little brick house in Wyckoff, New Jersey, two doors down from the church that my dad was the pastor at. And there was this back pathway through the woods that neighbored a cemetery. The cemetery was kind of frightening to me, but the time spent with my father walking down this back path, talking about life and music and creativity were some of my favorite memories growing up.</description>

Wir wohnten in einem kleinen Backsteinhaus in Wyckoff, New Jersey, zwei Türen weiter von der Kirche entfernt, in der mein Vater Pastor war. Es gab einen Weg durch den Wald, der direkt an einen Friedhof grenzte. Der Friedhof machte mir irgendwie Angst, aber die Zeit, die ich mit meinem Vater auf diesem Pfad verbrachte und in der wir über das Leben, die Musik und die Kreativität sprachen, gehörte zu meinen schönsten Erinnerungen an meine Kindheit.</description>

        <description>Ник Джонас: Когда я был ребенком, я любил гулять с отцом. Мы жили в маленьком кирпичном доме в Уайкоффе, Нью-Джерси, в двух шагах от церкви, в которой мой отец был пастором. С нашего заднего двора шла тропинка через лес, неподалеку от кладбища. Кладбище меня немного пугало, но время, проведенное с моим отцом, гуляя по этой тропинке, разговаривая о жизни, музыке и творчестве, было одним из моих любимых воспоминаний в детстве.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;d also say that&amp;rsquo;s pretty universal.
I think if you want to be the best at anything you do
or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.
The following is a conversation

They&amp;rsquo;re sisters, professional chess players,

        <description>Our card today is James Foote, the Seven of Clubs from Florida.
And James&amp;rsquo; story is unlike any that I&amp;rsquo;ve told you since we launched the deck earlier
this year.
With this bonus episode, I want to tell you a story that shows the power of what these
decks can do.
So you&amp;rsquo;re going to hear from the guy who invented the decks, about what inspired it,
and how they&amp;rsquo;re changing cold cases.</description>

        <description>Well, the source of energy at the origin of life
is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,
which is to say they release energy.
If you have hydrogen and CO2,
and you put them together in a falcon tube
and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade,
and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Leah Ulbrich, the Three of Clubs from Connecticut.
For months now, I&amp;rsquo;ve anticipated the release of this episode for a few reasons.
One is because the investigation is still very active and new discoveries were made
while our team was reporting on Leah&amp;rsquo;s case.
Actual breakthroughs that could lead to her murder getting solved.
And the second reason is because Leah&amp;rsquo;s family,
who&amp;rsquo;s been waiting nearly 30 years for answers, talked to us for this episode.</description>

        <description>Jon M. Chu: Caminar me hace sentir bien. El sonido de la grava, la hierba, del soplar de las hojas y del susurro de los árboles, y se pueden oír a los pájaros dispersarse en los arbustos o a las lagartijas correr. A mí eso me recuerda que no estamos solos, que hay un planeta y vidas a nuestro alrededor, que somos una parte de esto.

Há um certo som do cascalho, da grama, das folhas soprando e do barulho das árvores, e você pode ouvir pássaros nos arbustos ou lagartos correndo através deles. E para mim, esses são os lembretes de que você não está sozinho, que existe um planeta e vidas ao seu redor e que você é uma parte disso.

Il rumore della ghiaia, dell&amp;rsquo;erba, delle foglie che volteggiano, il fruscio degli alberi e gli uccellini che saltellano sui cespugli o le lucertole che vi guizzano in mezzo. Tutti questi suoni mi ricordano che non siamo soli, che c&amp;rsquo;è un pianeta che vive intorno a noi e che noi siamo un tassello di tutto questo.

Camminare, in un certo senso, ristabilisce un contatto con la realtà, con il pianeta Terra.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s a certain sound of the gravel, of the grass, of the leaves blowing and the rustling of the trees, and you can hear birds scatter in the bushes or lizards run across. And to me, those are the, the reminders that you&amp;rsquo;re not alone, that there is a planet and lives all around you and that you are one piece of this.</description>

Es gibt ein bestimmtes Geräusch des Kieses, des Grases, der wehenden Blätter und des Raschelns der Bäume, und man hört Vögel im Gebüsch oder Eidechsen, die über den Weg laufen. Für mich sind das die Erinnerungen daran, dass du nicht allein bist, dass es einen Planeten und Leben um dich herum gibt und dass du ein Teil davon bist.

        <description>Джон М. Чу: Ходьба всегда успокаивает меня. Есть определенный звук гравия, травы, шелест листьев и деревьев, и вы можете услышать, как птицы разбегаются в кустах или пробегают ящерицы. И для меня это напоминание о том, что ты не один, что есть планета и жизнь вокруг тебя, и что ты - частичка этого мира.
​
Ходьба как бы восстанавливает связь с реальностью, с планетой Земля.

You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

That&amp;rsquo;s mortality.
Mortality isn&amp;rsquo;t just some far flung event.

        <description>Will there be a war between U.S. and China in the 21st century?
If there is, we&amp;rsquo;re finished.
A war between the U.S. and China would destroy the possibilities of organized life on Earth.
The following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky, his second time on the podcast.
This episode is focused on the war in Ukraine.
And it is a departure from the way I usually do this podcast in several ways.</description>

Cindy was a 19-year-old college student enjoying a night out with friends when she made the

leave homicide detectives in Minnesota searching for answers for 45 years.

        <description>Malcolm Gladwell: Mi padre caminaba. Él regresaba a casa del trabajo todas las noches y pasaba una hora o más caminando, y también caminaba a la iglesia todos los domingos. Tan pronto como tuve la edad suficiente para caminar con él, lo hacía todos los domingos por la mañana, solo mi padre y yo. Creo que eran más o menos cinco kilómetros de ida y cinco de vuelta. Él nunca reducía la velocidad por mí.</description>

        <description>Malcolm Gladwell: Meu pai gostava de andar, ele chegava em casa do trabalho e saía para andar por uma hora ou uma hora e meia e ele também ia a pé até a igreja todos os domingos. Assim que eu tive idade para andar com ele, nós andávamos todas as manhãs, só nós dois. Andávamos cinco quilômetros para ir e cinco para voltar. Eu gostava do fato de ele achar que eu já era adulto o suficiente para acompanhá-lo.</description>

Tous les dimanches, il allait à pied jusqu&amp;rsquo;à l&amp;rsquo;Église. Quand je fus assez grand pour l&amp;rsquo;accompagner, je marchais avec lui tous les dimanches. Il y avait cinq kilomètres à l&amp;rsquo;aller et cinq kilomètres au retour. Il ne ralentissait jamais pour moi. Ça m&amp;rsquo;a toujours touché qu&amp;rsquo;il pense que je sois suffisamment adulte pour aller à son rythme.</description>

E non appena sono diventato abbastanza grande da passeggiare con lui, camminavo ogni domenica mattina, solo io e mio padre. Credo che fossero poco meno di cinque chilometri e poi quasi altri cinque verso casa. Non rallentava mai per me. Ero sempre colpito dal fatto che mi considerasse abbastanza adulto da tenere il suo passo.</description>

And as soon as I was old enough to walk with him, I walked every Sunday morning, just me and my father. I think it was probably three miles and then three miles home. He would never slow down for me.</description>

Und sobald ich alt genug war, um mit ihm zu laufen, bin ich jeden Sonntagmorgen mit meinem Vater gelaufen. Ich glaube, es waren etwa drei Meilen und dann noch einmal drei Meilen nach Hause. Er wurde nie langsamer für mich. Es hat mich immer sehr berührt, dass er annahm, ich sei erwachsen genug, um mit ihm Schritt zu halten.</description>

И как только я стал достаточно взрослым, чтобы ходить вместе с ним, мы стали гулять каждое утро в воскресенье. Только я и мой отец. Мне кажется, мы шли примерно пять километров туда и столько же назад домой. Он никогда не сбавлял скорость из-за меня.</description>

        <description>KESHA: I like going for a walk to get myself out of my head.
​
I also just have started walking around my neighborhood and found little cool, old houses from the &amp;rsquo;40s I never noticed before. One woman has a rose garden, and we started talking, and now I go visit her and her roses every day. So it&amp;rsquo;s a way of connecting with my community, too. Just any time I can shake up the energy, I think it&amp;rsquo;s positive for me.</description>

        <description>KESHA: Ich gehe gerne spazieren, um meinen Kopf freizukriegen.
​
Ich habe auch gerade erst angefangen, durch meine Nachbarschaft zu wandern und kleine coole, alte Häuser aus den 40ern zu finden, die ich vorher nie bemerkt hatte. Eine Frau hat einen Rosengarten und wir sind ins Gespräch gekommen, und jetzt besuche ich sie und ihre Rosen jeden Tag. Es ist also auch ein Weg, Kontakt zu meiner Umgebung aufzubauen. Jedes Mal, wenn ich die Energie aufbringe, ist das sehr gut für mich.</description>

        <description>КЕША: Я люблю гулять, чтобы отвлечься от своих мыслей.
​
Я также просто начала гулять по своему району и обнаружила маленькие классные старые дома 40-х годов, которых раньше не замечала. У одной женщины есть сад с розами, мы разговорились, и теперь я каждый день хожу к ней и любуюсь ее розами. Так что это еще и способ связи с моим обществом. Просто в любое время, когда я могу встряхнуть энергию, я думаю, что это позитивно для меня.</description>

        <description>Evolutionarily, if we see a lion running at us,
we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to sort of calculate
the lion&amp;rsquo;s kinetic energy and is it optimal
to go this way or that way, you just react it.
And physically our bodies are well attuned
to actually make right decisions.
But when you&amp;rsquo;re playing a game like poker,
this is not something that you ever evolved to do.
And yet you&amp;rsquo;re in that same flight or fight response.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Anne Klein, the aid of hearts from Indiana.
Anne was a loving wife and devoted teacher who was well on her way to earning a master&amp;rsquo;s
degree, when one winter afternoon in 1973, she was viciously attacked outside her classroom.
This episode is a special one because I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to tell Anne&amp;rsquo;s story ever since I
first heard about it years ago, long before we ever started this show.</description>

In 2008, Natasha was a young mother of two who was working two jobs to provide for her
family, when one night, on a dark stretch of road, a stranger came across her path and
forever changed her life.
That person has gone unnamed and unknown for 14 years, and now, law enforcement is opening
up, hoping justice can finally be served.</description>

        <description>Sam Sanchez: Este episodio tiene una breve mención de un tema delicado.
​
Anderson Cooper: Me encanta pasear, especialmente en Nueva York, porque me resulta contemplativo. He pasado gran parte de mi vida corriendo de un lugar a otro y tratando de llegar a una historia, tratando de llegar a un país donde algo esté sucediendo. Cuando estoy allí, me concentro en trabajar y elaborar una historia y escribir algo que le haga justicia a los eventos que se desarrollan a mi alrededor.</description>

​
Anderson Cooper: Eu adoro fazer caminhadas, especialmente em Nova York porque é meditativo para mim. Eu passei uma boa parte da minha vida correndo de um lugar para outro e tentando fazer uma história, tentando estar em um país em que algo realmente estivesse acontecendo. E quando estava nesse lugar, eu ficava focado em escrever uma história que fizesse justiça aos eventos que estavam acontecendo ao meu redor.</description>

        <description>Sam Sanchez : Cet épisode fait brièvement mention d&amp;rsquo;un sujet sensible.
​
Anderson Cooper : J&amp;rsquo;aime me promener, surtout à New York, car ça me permet de méditer. J&amp;rsquo;ai passé une grande partie de ma vie à courir d&amp;rsquo;un endroit à l&amp;rsquo;autre pour essayer de trouver un sujet, de me rendre dans un pays où quelque chose se passait. Sur place, je me concentre sur mon travail, sur la rédaction de l&amp;rsquo;histoire et sur la manière de rendre justice aux événements qui se déroulent autour de moi.</description>

        <description>Sam Sanchez: In questo episodio viene brevemente menzionato un argomento sensibile.
​
Anderson Cooper: Adoro fare delle passeggiate, specialmente a New York, perché per me è meditativo. Ho trascorso gran parte della mia vita andando di corsa da un posto all’altro e cercando di ottenere una storia, cercando di andare in un paese dove sta succedendo qualcosa. E quando sono lì, sono concentrato sul lavoro e sulla creazione di una storia, scrivere qualcosa che gli renda giustizia, che renda giustizia agli eventi che si svolgono attorno a me.</description>

        <description>Sam Sanchez: This episode has a brief mention of a sensitive topic.
​
Anderson Cooper: I love to go for walks, especially in New York, because it’s meditative for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of my life just kind of rushing from one place to another and trying to get to a story, trying to get to a country where something is happening. And when I&amp;rsquo;m there, I&amp;rsquo;m focused on working and crafting a story and, and writing something that does justice to, to the events that are unfolding all around me.</description>

        <description>Sam Sanchez: In dieser Folge wird ein heikles Thema kurz erwähnt.
​
Anderson Cooper: Ich liebe es, spazieren zu gehen, besonders in New York, weil das für mich meditativ ist. Ich habe einen Großteil meines Lebens damit verbracht, von einem Ort zum anderen zu eilen und zu versuchen, zu einer Geschichte zu kommen, in ein Land zu gelangen, in dem etwas passiert. Und wenn ich dort bin, konzentriere ich mich darauf, eine Geschichte zu schreiben, die den Ereignissen, die sich um mich herum abspielen, gerecht wird.</description>

and when they do, they&amp;rsquo;re gonna have to pay consequences.

        <description>Our card this week is Leanna Warner, the Ace of Hearts from Minnesota.
Leanna&amp;rsquo;s case is one of those that once you&amp;rsquo;ve heard about it, you will never forget
about it.
She was just five years old and not even two blocks away from her family&amp;rsquo;s house when
she disappeared in the middle of the day.
The mystery has haunted Leanna&amp;rsquo;s family and hometown for 18 years.
I&amp;rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</description>

and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.
It was all still keyboard.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t even have mice set up at that time,
but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.
The wall disappears in a little animation
and there&amp;rsquo;s a monster like right there.

Kelly D. Wilson was a young woman whose life and career as a rising star on radio was tragically

her family, and it left detectives baffled to this very day.</description>

        <description>Ibram X. Kendi: Cuando salgo a caminar, lo pienso como un momento para pensar y para resolver mis problemas, sean problemas de esta época o problemas de mi vida. Salir a caminar es un momento para estar tranquilo, para simplemente estar con uno mismo. Y en muchos aspectos, nuestras vidas van a toda marcha, y hay momentos en los que necesitamos calmarnos y enfocarnos. Sin ninguna duda, cuando salimos a caminar, podemos hacerlo.</description>

        <description>Ibram X. Kendi: Quando faço uma caminhada, penso nisso como um tempo em que posso pensar e posso descobrir como resolver problemas, sejam os problemas de nosso tempo ou os problemas que estou enfrentando na minha própria vida. Dar uma caminhada é um tempo para parar, é um tempo para realmente ser apenas um com você mesmo. E em muitos aspectos, nossas vidas estão sobrecarregadas e há momentos em que realmente precisamos nos acomodar e nos concentrar e, certamente, quando caminhamos, conseguimos fazer isso.</description>

        <description>Ibram X. Kendi : Quand je sors marcher, je me dis que c’est un moment pendant lequel je peux réfléchir et trouver des solutions à des problèmes, que ça soit les problèmes de notre époque, ou les problèmes de ma vie personnelle. La marche est un moment où tout s’arrête, on est seul avec soi-même. Nos vies sont souvent suractives, et par moment, on a besoin de se recentrer. La marche est parfaite pour le faire.</description>

        <description>Ibram X. Kendi: Camminare è un’occasione per riflettere e trovare la soluzione ai problemi, che si tratti di problemi del nostro tempo o di quelli che sto affrontando nella vita. Camminare significa stare in silenzio, significa entrare in sintonia con noi stessi. Per un motivo o per un altro, viviamo una vita frenetica e ci sono momenti in cui sentiamo forte il bisogno di tirare il freno e raccogliere i pensieri.</description>

        <description>Ibram X. Kendi: When I go for a walk, I think of it as a time in which I can think and I can figure out how to solve problems, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the problems of our time or problems that I&amp;rsquo;m facing within my own life. Going for a walk is a time to be still, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to really just be one with yourself. And in many ways, our lives are on overdrive, and there are times in which we really need to settle ourselves and focus ourselves and certainly when we go for a walk, we&amp;rsquo;re able to do that.</description>

Kendi: Wenn ich spazieren gehe, sehe ich das als eine Zeit, in der ich nachdenken und herausfinden kann, wie ich Probleme lösen kann, egal ob es die Probleme unserer Zeit sind oder Probleme, die ich in meinem eigenen Leben habe. Spazierengehen ist eine Zeit der Stille, eine Zeit, in der du wirklich mit dir selbst eins bist.

        <description>Ибрам X. Кенди: Для меня прогулка — это время, когда я могу подумать над решением проблем, будь то глобальные проблемы современности или сложности в моей личной жизни. Прогулка замедляет ритм, позволяет побыть наедине с собой. Бывают моменты, когда нам просто необходимо скрыться от изнуряющего ритма современной жизни, сконцентрироваться. Прогулка очень в этом помогает.

        <description>Uzo Aduba: Amo caminar. Cuando me mudé a Nueva York, no siempre tenía dinero para el boleto del subterráneo, y caminaba desde mi casa hasta Queens para ir a mi trabajo sirviendo mesas. Pero luego se transformó en una oportunidad privada y personal para meditar los temas que no tenía tiempo de pensar durante los días ocupados. Lo que descubrí fue que, al final de mis caminatas, tenía las respuestas a muchas de mis preguntas o decisiones que intentaba tomar.</description>

        <description>Uzo Aduba: Eu adoro caminhar e, quando me mudei para Nova York, nem sempre tinha dinheiro para a passagem do metrô e caminhava da cidade para o Queens depois do trabalho. Mas então realmente se tornou essa oportunidade particular e pessoal de conversar comigo mesma sobre algumas das conversas que eu não tive tempo para ter durante o dia agitado. E então, o que eu descobri é que, no final das minhas caminhadas, normalmente tinha as respostas para muitas das perguntas ou decisões que estava tentando tomar.</description>

        <description>Uzo Aduba : J’adore marcher. Quand j’ai déménagé à New York, je n’avais pas d’argent pour me payer un ticket de métro. Alors, je marchais depuis chez moi jusqu’au Queens, où j’étais serveuse. Et puis, c’est devenu mon moment à moi, un moment privilégié où je peux prendre le temps de réfléchir. Je me suis rendu compte qu’en marchant, je finissais toujours par trouver la réponse à mes questions ou aux décisions que j’essayais de prendre.</description>

        <description>Uzo Aduba: Adoro camminare e, quando mi sono trasferita a New York per la prima volta, non avevo sempre i soldi per il biglietto della metropolitana e andavo a piedi da casa al Queens, fino al mio lavoro da cameriera. Ma poi è diventata davvero un&amp;rsquo;opportunità privata e personale di avere con me stessa alcune delle conversazioni che non avevo tempo di fare durante la mia giornata piena. E così ho scoperto che, alla fine delle mie passeggiate, di solito avevo le risposte a molte delle mie domande o alle decisioni che stavo cercando di prendere.</description>

        <description>Uzo Aduba: I love to walk, and when I first moved to New York I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the money for the subway fare and would walk from the city home to Queens from my waiting job. But then it really became this private, personal opportunity to talk through with myself some of the conversations I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to have during the busy day. And so what I would find is that, at the end of my walks, I would usually have the answers to a lot of the questions or decisions that I was trying to make.</description>

        <description>Uzo Aduba: Ich liebe es zu Fuß zu gehen, und als ich nach New York gezogen bin, hatte ich nicht immer das Geld für die U-Bahn und bin von meinem Kellnerinnenjob von der Innenstadt bis nach Queens gelaufen. Aber dann wurde es vielmehr dieser private, persönliche Augenblick, um Gespräche mit mir selbst zu führen, für die ich während des stressigen Arbeitstages keine Zeit hatte. So hab‘ ich herausgefunden, dass ich am Ende dieser Spaziergänge meistens die Antworten auf viele der Fragen oder Entscheidungen hatte, die ich zu treffen versucht hatte.</description>

        <description>Узо Адуба: Мне нравится ходить пешком; когда я только переехала в Нью-Йорк, у меня не всегда были деньги на метро, и после работы официанткой я шла пешком из Манхэттена домой, в Куинс. Но со временем прогулки стали для меня возможностью основательно проговорить с самой собой вопросы, на которые мне не хватало времени в течение рабочего дня. И я заметила, что обычно к концу прогулки, я находила ответы на многие вопросы и принимала важные решения.</description>

        <description>no reason to think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon. And likewise, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to
think that the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,
there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.
It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there&amp;rsquo;s

whether it&amp;rsquo;s bell curve or any research
on race differences,
can that be used to increase the amount of racism
in the world, can that be used to increase
the amount of hate in the world?

Before we get started with today&amp;rsquo;s show, I want to tell you about something really awesome that we&amp;rsquo;re doing around here. Back in October, I flew to India to spend a few weeks in Dharamsala. That&amp;rsquo;s a small city nestled at the foot of the Himalayas surrounded by beautiful cedar forests. It&amp;rsquo;s also home to Tenzin Gyatso, who you probably know as the 14th Dalai Lama. He has claimed that the purpose of life is to be happy.</description>

        <description>Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets.
Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple. These are exploitative
class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another
group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,
resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Bobby Lee,
a standup comedian and podcaster,
and one of the funniest humans on the planet.
And just someone who brings joy to my heart
with a mix of non-sequitur absurdity,
darkness, and the singing voice of an angel.
In all seriousness, Bobby&amp;rsquo;s just a beautiful human being.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of his for 20 years,
since his time on Matt TV,
to today with his podcast, Tiger Belly,</description>

What kind of questions would you ask?
The following is a conversation with Oliver Stone.
He&amp;rsquo;s one of the greatest filmmakers of all time
with three Oscar wins and 11 Oscar nominations.
His films tell stories of war and power,

I don&amp;rsquo;t just disagree with it.
I don&amp;rsquo;t just think it&amp;rsquo;s against the 14th Amendment.
I hate it.
The hatred comes from an understanding
that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute
for the actual development of the capacities
of our people to compete.

Previous technologies, I mean,

and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you&amp;rsquo;re actually inflating the money supply
at 7% but you&amp;rsquo;re calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you&amp;rsquo;re literally bleeding

        <description>We think that self assembly,
this modular reconfigurable algorithm
for constructing space structures in orbit
is gonna give us this promise of space architecture
that&amp;rsquo;s actually worth living in.
You see, you do believe we might one day
become intergalactic civilization.
I have a hope, yeah.
The following is a conversation with Ariel Ekblah,
Director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative.
She&amp;rsquo;s especially interested in autonomously
self assembling space architectures.

of for many years, for the kindness in his heart, the strength of his character, and
the kind of friends he keeps and talks with, many of whom disagree with him but love him
nevertheless, including the late Christopher Hitchens.
I will have many conversations like these in the future about religion, about Islam,</description>

My Catholic school education is taking Center Stage, because if you think about it, when people hear spiritualism or the occult, the things we talked about on this show, people tend to connect that with religion, often times organized, religion.</description>

इतना अनैतिक लगता है।

In the months leading up to the Bucyrus estates murders, there was a pharmacy burglary ring operating in Ohio. Pharmacies were being broken into and the stolen drugs were being sold.</description>

Actually, it was just drinks because this was when there was still so much uncertainty with COVID. We followed all the rules and we met friends at a distance. And while it was great to just have human interaction again. An even greater moment happened as we were leaving. The wife handed me a book that she said she thought I might find interesting.</description>

        <description>Baby love, I think I′ve been a little too kind
Didn&amp;rsquo;t notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works
When you′re in their top 5
And by the way
I&amp;rsquo;m going out tonight
Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band</description>

        <description>No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause it′s all over now
All out to sea
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to pine about
I′ve got a lot to live without
I&amp;rsquo;m never gonna meet</description>

If it feels like a trap
You′re already in one
Dear reader
Get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader
Burn all the files, desert all your past lives
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize yourself
That means you did it right
Never take advice from someone who′s falling apart

        <description>We were supposed to be just friends
You don′t live in my part of town, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I′m in
And what&amp;rsquo;s in my system
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch
Five seconds later, I′m fastening myself to you with a stitch
And I′m not even sorry
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit</description>

Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn′t know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was
Freeloading
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you were keeping count
High infidelity
Put on your records
And regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around
Dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones
And burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives</description>

Addicted to betrayal, but you&amp;rsquo;re relevant
You′re terrified to look down
&amp;lsquo;Cause if you dare, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It′s coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn′t know what I mean
&amp;lsquo;Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend</description>

Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through
Breathe deep, breathe out
I′ll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can&amp;rsquo;t last
Uh oh, I′m falling in love
Oh no, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love again
Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don′t ever say too much
And you don&amp;rsquo;t really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I′m damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal

Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf ′cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;d we end up on the floor anyway?&amp;rdquo;
You say
&amp;ldquo;Your roommate′s cheap-ass screw top rosé
That&amp;rsquo;s how&amp;rdquo;
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes</description>

        <description>Once upon a time
The planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn′t lose
What if I told you
None of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me</description>

        <description>Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart ′cause he was nice</description>

Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t but thanks though

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
′Cause I don&amp;rsquo;t remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I′ve searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin&amp;rsquo; situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?</description>

Saw flecks of what could′ve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can&amp;rsquo;t stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I′m unglued - thanks to you
And it&amp;rsquo;s like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin&amp;rsquo; beautiful

Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh&amp;hellip;
They said the end is coming
Everyone′s up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings
Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving
You′re in the kitchen humming

Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
All that bloodshed
Crimson clover
Uh huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War</description>

I don′t dress for men

Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could′ve
Spit me out at the first chance
If I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands
Oh, all I used to do was pray
Would&amp;rsquo;ve, could&amp;rsquo;ve, should′ve

I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He′s gonna notice me
It&amp;rsquo;s okay, we′re the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice
You&amp;rsquo;re smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it&amp;rsquo;s your face
I didn′t choose this town
I dream of getting out
There′s just one who could make me stay

It&amp;rsquo;s the Jazz Age, the 1920s in Paris picture this women on stage dancing, in their little flapper outfits, scored by trumpets and heavy drums.
You can imagine cigarette, smoke and cheers from Men in the audience.
0:23
The drums get faster, the flappers On Stage dance in unison, kicking their legs out and twirling around.
And then a woman breaks through their line.
She&amp;rsquo;s young, she has short slicked down hair, she wears, red lipstick, she&amp;rsquo;s black, she hurries across the stage frantically, taking her, dress off as she goes, she&amp;rsquo;s shaking her hips throwing her arms up, winding her waist that woman.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Jeff Hawkins, a neuroscientist seeking to understand
the structure, function, and origin of intelligence in the human brain.
He previously wrote a seminal book on the subject titled On Intelligence, and recently a new book
called A Thousand Brains, which presents a new theory of intelligence that Richard Dawkins,
for example, has been raving about, calling the book quote brilliant and exhilarating.
I can&amp;rsquo;t read those two words and not think of him saying it in his British accent.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Brett Weinstein,
evolutionary biologist, author, cohost
of the Dark Horse podcast, and, as he says,
reluctant radical.
Even though we&amp;rsquo;ve never met or spoken before this,
we both felt like we&amp;rsquo;ve been friends for a long time,
I don&amp;rsquo;t agree on everything with Brett,
but I&amp;rsquo;m sure as hell happy he exists
in this weird and wonderful world of ours.

MEGHAN: I remember every little thing about it. I wanted it to be at The Bel-Air Hotel. And there was a swan lake, and I wanted the cake to be from Hanson’s Bakery. And the dress - oh my goodness, the dress was strapless and poofy and I’d seen it in a bridal magazine … and, and I bought it, I mean not, not the dress – I bought the bridal magazine because I took this project seriously.</description>

I think it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say Harry.
Houdini is a legend and the World of Magic.
And one of the most iconic Escape artists who&amp;rsquo;ve ever lived.
Certainly I know he is a personal hero of yours, he sure is.
And the reason I&amp;rsquo;m bringing him up today is because while magicians don&amp;rsquo;t usually reveal the secrets to their tricks, Houdini once went on a crusade against spiritualism to expose mediums and psychics as frauds.</description>

in a positive way, but with much more personal and intellectual freedom than has defined college
campuses in recent history. I think this is a very difficult but worthy project.</description>

Not to address current events, especially when what we&amp;rsquo;re living through.
Now, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is the result of a long and complicated history.
Ukraine has been an independent country since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t erase Russian President, Vladimir Putin&amp;rsquo;s desire, to bring it back, under Russian rule, on February 24th.</description>

host of Hardcore History and Common Sense Podcasts.
To me, Hardcore History is one of,

Dan and Joe Rogan are probably the two main people

as a fan and eventually as a podcaster myself.
Meeting Dan was surreal.
To me, he was not just a mere human like the rest of us,</description>

Livewired is a work of 10 years on a topic
that is fascinating to me, which is neuroplasticity
or the malleability of the human brain.</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hosting this podcast called Artificial Intelligence for over two years now.

First, that&amp;rsquo;s what most people call it anyway.
Second, I&amp;rsquo;ve already been interviewing physicists, historians, philosophers, mathematicians,
writers, athletes.
Switching away from AI in the name gives me the freedom to do that a little bit more.

Today.

But just suffice to say, people call him PJ who are friends with him.

        <description>The following is a conversation with Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at University of Oxford
and the director of the Future of Humanity Institute.
He has worked on fascinating and important ideas in existential risk, simulation hypothesis,
human enhancement ethics, and the risks of superintelligent AI systems, including in
his book, Superintelligence.
I can see talking to Nick multiple times in this podcast, many hours each time, because
he has done some incredible work in artificial intelligence, in technology, space, science,</description>

This is such a sad time of the day after it&amp;rsquo;s just a little anticlimactic because it&amp;rsquo;s, like we lead up to all of that and then you get your presents from Santa daddy, daddy.

        <description>The following is a conversation with John Hopfield,
professor at Princeton, whose life&amp;rsquo;s work weaved beautifully
through biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics.
Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology
through the piercing eyes of a physicist.
He&amp;rsquo;s perhaps best known for his work
on associative neural networks,
now known as Hopfield networks,
that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed
the development of the modern field of deep learning.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with David Chalmers.
He&amp;rsquo;s a philosopher and cognitive scientist

Seances are one of those areas of spiritualism that can be polarizing, but spiritualism is also personal and seances can be very personal.
I cannot wait to hear about this topic.
I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what else to say except tell me more.
Well, I think today&amp;rsquo;s topic is super interesting because we have seances taking place in the white house.

He is the creator of C++, a programming language that, after 40 years, is still one of the most

he dominated the chess world,
ranking world number one for most of those 19 years.
While he has many historical matches
against human chess players,
in the long arc of history he may be remembered
for his match against the machine, IBM&amp;rsquo;s Deep Blue.</description>

I would say almost every Supernatural monster has a real life origin story and that includes werewolves.
Now.
I&amp;rsquo;m not saying they&amp;rsquo;re real but they do have a very real past.
They were real to me as a little kid, at least one actor did Lon Chaney jr.
He was a werewolf and like the some of the older movies.

        <description>Thank you.
Pleasure for us to be here tonight.
It&amp;rsquo;s April 29th, 2003, and Siegfried and Roy are performing their usual Tuesday night show.
Just five months from now, Monocor will attack Roy on this very stage.
Tonight&amp;rsquo;s show, however, will go off without a hitch.
Boy and I gonna do all the work, all right?
Boy, when I found out that I was going to go to Las Vegas, I immediately knew I was going to buy a ticket to Siegfried and Roy.</description>

A lot of people love to have answers or reassurance, or just a sense of foresight when it comes to their lives.
I personally crave reassurance wherever I can get it.
So quietly.
I&amp;rsquo;m in this camp and Taro is a way to get that in some ways.
I agree.

And I am 110% on board for this episode.
I cannot wait to learn more about tarot.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to for a long.</description>

On September 21st, 1997, the Oakland Raiders are facing the New York Jets.
In the first quarter, Raider kicker Cole forward is called out to attempt a 44 yard field goal.
So far this season, the 24 year old USC alum has become the most accurate kicker in Raiders history.
But that statistic will be short lived.</description>

        <description>Siegfried and Roy.
They&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this for you know, 30 years and never had an incident and now all of a sudden they had an incident.
They&amp;rsquo;re like, whoa, this is not typical.
Michael Game is the police detective with the Las Vegas counterterrorism unit.
He is investigating whether the tiger attack wasn&amp;rsquo;t an accident.
So everybody I think was just kind of like something had to happen.
So what we were looking at was did somebody in the audience do something to cause the animal to react differently than it was normally known to react?</description>

In Puerto Rico, Gina Goodwin was born in Puerto Rico, where her mother, Kathy, is a dancer at the Americana Hotel there.
Kathy first meets a new opening act called Siegfried and Roy.
Back in the day when she was performing, she was in Puerto Rico and Siegfried and Roy happened to be opening up for her show.</description>

        <description>It&amp;rsquo;s April 3rd, 2002 and families are lining up outside a big carnival like attraction at the Cielo Vista Mall in El Paso, TX.
From what I remember, it was out in the parking lot.
They&amp;rsquo;ve all bought tickets to do something special.
You had to go inside of the cage.
I was sitting in a chair, I believe from my recollection that the cat was in a cage right to the side of where you sit down and got your picture taken.</description>

        <description>It was just another night.
That&amp;rsquo;s all it was.
I think we had to be there at 7 and this should start at 7:30.
I&amp;rsquo;m in the mail dressing room which is a mix of dancers and acrobats, and then, but we&amp;rsquo;re wearing these body suits that make us look like we&amp;rsquo;re super muscular and took like 10 minutes to squeeze into them every day.
I was still getting used to the fact that I was dancing alongside giant wild animals.</description>

It feels a little ironic that the idea of finding Miracle Waters to restore.
Our youth is actually one of the oldest spiritual stories ever told.
But it&amp;rsquo;s also not that surprising.
Yeah, here&amp;rsquo;s a concept that&amp;rsquo;s thousands of years old that could keep you looking less than 50.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know.

I am a big fan of the movies.
That&amp;rsquo;s for sure.
That&amp;rsquo;s one step in.
Well, there&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of a Twist because the author of the Sherlock Holmes books spent a big part of his life investigating psychic and paranormal phenomena, so, He was sort of a real life, spiritual detective.</description>

So, on Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, I was at a friend&amp;rsquo;s place having leftovers and I pulled out my phone at the dinner table, which is something you should never do, and Twitter is on fire with news of a new variant.

First detected and announced that of South Africa called the Omicron variant.
So first I have to learn how to say the word Omicron and then I get completely sucked into the Vortex of Doom, scrolling through my phone for the next half hour.</description>

Second guy, offers a fist bump.
I&amp;rsquo;m fine with that.
I make a fist, do the bump third guy, does the elbow thing?
You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the other thing like he kind of puts his hand in a shoulder and the swings around the elbow and I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to swing around my elbow to meet in midair it A weird amount of elbow coordination between two people who don&amp;rsquo;t know each other.</description>

I want to talk about the economy today.
At any given moment.
There are like 1,000 things going on in the US economy, the unemployment rates doing this, and the stock, market&amp;rsquo;s doing that and Retail inflation or over here, doing their own thing.
It is a big messy, complicated story, but somehow when that big messy, complicated story is filtered through the media message making machine.
