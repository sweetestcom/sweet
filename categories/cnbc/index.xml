        <description>Jensen, thank you so much for being here today.
And I want to get started just with a question that is
really basic, but I think chips have been in the
ecosystem a lot more lately, and there&amp;rsquo;s people
who probably didn&amp;rsquo;t even really know what a
semiconductor was a few years ago.
Can you give me a very basic definition of what
Nvidia is?
Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s an easy question.</description>
