        <description>Okay, ready?
One, two, three.
Awesome.
Good.
Hi, Jenny.
How are you?
I&amp;rsquo;m good.
How are you?
Good.
What have you had it with?
I have had it with the continued idiocy of people that see the sign on the front door
of my office and continue to walk in to suite two looking for other suites.
I&amp;rsquo;m really anxious to greet one of the people at the door and say, step outside here.</description>

        <description>How many of the full do you drink per day, that full Stanley cup?
It&amp;rsquo;s 40 ounces.
I would say probably minimum of six.
Six?
Six times 40, what&amp;rsquo;s that?
Let me try it.
It&amp;rsquo;s heavy.
See, it&amp;rsquo;s heavy.
Oh my God, you just got it all over your white shirt.
Shit.
Oh, 200 ounces of that per day?
Probably.
I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear to put my mouth on that.</description>

        <description>Make sure your mind gets close to you.
Um, okay, should the pups do the clapping?
Should we fix her hair first?
What is happening to my hair?
Well, fix it!
Be nice!
Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean, like, should we fix it?
For God&amp;rsquo;s sake!
She was contemplating what to happen.
I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, Millie.
That was so mean.
Fix it!
Is that better?

        <description>Do you still have those bat wings?
Bat wings?
I thought you told me, like, your vagina, you had those, like, so you still have the
meat flaps.
Okay, do the clapping.
Do the clapping before this takes a sinister turn.
One, two, three.
That sucked.
You always say it sucks.
One, two, three.

No, but I&amp;rsquo;m about to gag over my own breath right now because it&amp;rsquo;s so terrible.
What did you eat?
Caesar salad and it&amp;rsquo;s bad, so don&amp;rsquo;t try to French kiss me.
You will not be happy.
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting you bring up French kissing because we&amp;rsquo;re going to get into this
episode, fetishes.
I cannot wait, like I&amp;rsquo;m salivating at the thought, I&amp;rsquo;m so excited.</description>

        <description>There you are.
Oh, do I need to get my glasses?
Did you put on panties?
I did.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s like National Commando Day.
Every day is National Commando Day for me, except with this dress on.
So what made you want to wear panties today?
You don&amp;rsquo;t want your vagine on?
I don&amp;rsquo;t want the vagine all over the podcast.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already got my armpit.
Fix me, Nelly.
That is a very loaded request, yes.</description>

        <description>Jay Welch, let me tell you what I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with today.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hear it.
So I went to this yoga studio, and they make you sign all this shit.
So I gave my phone number.
So when I&amp;rsquo;m leaving afterwards, I tell the girl straight up to her face, I can&amp;rsquo;t ever
come back because it&amp;rsquo;s too hot.
It was 85 degrees.
So I come out and tell her, and I was like, take me off your list.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s kind of weird, but yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it.
Especially our children. We&amp;rsquo;re the biggest pushers.</description>
