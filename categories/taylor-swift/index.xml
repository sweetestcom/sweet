        <description>I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin&amp;rsquo; on
They say that if it&amp;rsquo;s right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by</description>

        <description>I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I′ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I&amp;rsquo;ll watch as you′re leaving</description>

        <description>Baby love, I think I′ve been a little too kind
Didn&amp;rsquo;t notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works
When you′re in their top 5
And by the way
I&amp;rsquo;m going out tonight
Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band</description>

        <description>No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause it′s all over now
All out to sea
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to pine about
I′ve got a lot to live without
I&amp;rsquo;m never gonna meet</description>

        <description>Dear reader
If it feels like a trap
You′re already in one
Dear reader
Get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader
Burn all the files, desert all your past lives
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize yourself
That means you did it right
Never take advice from someone who′s falling apart
Never take advice from someone who&amp;rsquo;s falling apart
Dear reader
Bend when you can
Snap when you have to</description>

        <description>We were supposed to be just friends
You don′t live in my part of town, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I′m in
And what&amp;rsquo;s in my system
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch
Five seconds later, I′m fastening myself to you with a stitch
And I′m not even sorry
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit</description>

        <description>Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn′t know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was
Freeloading
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you were keeping count
High infidelity
Put on your records
And regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around
Dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones
And burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives</description>

        <description>You′re talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you&amp;rsquo;re relevant
You′re terrified to look down
&amp;lsquo;Cause if you dare, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It′s coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn′t know what I mean
&amp;lsquo;Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend</description>

        <description>It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through
Breathe deep, breathe out
I′ll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can&amp;rsquo;t last
Uh oh, I′m falling in love
Oh no, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love again
Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love
I thought the plane was going down</description>

        <description>Meet me at midnight&amp;hellip;
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don′t ever say too much
And you don&amp;rsquo;t really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I′m damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me</description>

        <description>When the morning came we
Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf ′cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;d we end up on the floor anyway?&amp;rdquo;
You say
&amp;ldquo;Your roommate′s cheap-ass screw top rosé
That&amp;rsquo;s how&amp;rdquo;
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes</description>

        <description>Once upon a time
The planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn′t lose
What if I told you
None of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me</description>

        <description>Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart ′cause he was nice</description>

        <description>Your ex-friend′s sister met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t but thanks though
I′m so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the news
Cause we were somewhere else</description>

        <description>I remember
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
′Cause I don&amp;rsquo;t remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I′ve searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin&amp;rsquo; situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?</description>

        <description>One night a few moons ago I
Saw flecks of what could′ve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can&amp;rsquo;t stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I′m unglued - thanks to you
And it&amp;rsquo;s like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin&amp;rsquo; beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful</description>

        <description>I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh&amp;hellip;
They said the end is coming
Everyone′s up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings
Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving
You′re in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was</description>

        <description>My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
All that bloodshed
Crimson clover
Uh huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War</description>

        <description>Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I′m the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don&amp;rsquo;t dress for women
I don′t dress for men
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dressing for revenge
I don&amp;rsquo;t start shit but I can tell you how it ends
Don′t get sad, get even</description>

        <description>If you would′ve blinked, then I would&amp;rsquo;ve
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could′ve
Spit me out at the first chance
If I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands
Oh, all I used to do was pray
Would&amp;rsquo;ve, could&amp;rsquo;ve, should′ve
If you′d never looked my way</description>

        <description>Summer went away
Still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He′s gonna notice me
It&amp;rsquo;s okay, we′re the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice
You&amp;rsquo;re smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it&amp;rsquo;s your face
I didn′t choose this town
I dream of getting out
There′s just one who could make me stay
All my days</description>
