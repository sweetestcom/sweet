        <description>Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don′t know what&amp;rsquo;s lost ′til you find it
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin&amp;rsquo; for us to do
We don&amp;rsquo;t really like what′s on the news, but it′s on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin&amp;rsquo; someone else′s name
I remember back at Jonny&amp;rsquo;s place, it′s not the same anymore</description>

        <description>Boyfriends
They think you′re so easy
They take you for granted
They don&amp;rsquo;t know they′re just misunderstanding
You
You, you&amp;rsquo;re back at it again
Weakened
When you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he&amp;rsquo;s thinking
You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door
You′re no closer to him
Now you′re halfway home</description>

        <description>You got a new life
Am I bothering you?
Do you wanna talk?
We share the last line
Then we drink the wall
′Til we wanna talk
I go &amp;lsquo;round and ′round
Satellite
Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in
I can see you&amp;rsquo;re lonely down there
Don&amp;rsquo;t you know that I am right here?
Spinning out, waiting for ya to pull me in
I can see you′re lonely down there</description>

        <description>Black and white film camera
Yellow sunglasses
Ashtray, swimming pool
Hot wax, jump off the roof
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Should we just keep driving?&amp;rdquo;
Maple syrup, coffee
Pancakes for two
Hash brown, egg yolk
I will always love you
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Should we just keep driving?</description>

        <description>Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Living in a daydream
She said, &amp;ldquo;Love me like you paid me&amp;rdquo;
You know, I′ll be gone for so long
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
Ooh-ooh
Stay until the morning
&amp;lsquo;Cause, baby, loving you′s the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
(All of your love, give me something to dream about)</description>

        <description>You got, you got the cinema
It′s you
And I&amp;rsquo;m not gettin′ over it
Darlin&amp;rsquo;, is it cool
If I&amp;rsquo;m stubborn when it comes to this?
I guess we′re in time
If you′re getting yourself wet for me
I guess you&amp;rsquo;re all mine
You′re sleeping in this bed with me
I just think you&amp;rsquo;re cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I′m cool too?
Or am I too into you?</description>

        <description>You were riding your bike to the sound of &amp;ldquo;It′s No Big Deal&amp;rdquo;
And you&amp;rsquo;re trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing about the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming ′til now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family, &amp;lsquo;cause they never showed you love</description>

        <description>Little freak, Jezebel
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze, crystal ball
Somehow, you′ve become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
I was thinkin&amp;rsquo; about who you are
Your delicate point of view, I
Was thinkin′ about you
I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to, I&amp;rsquo;m</description>

        <description>I′m on the roof, you&amp;rsquo;re in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleeding, looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope, you were just doing cocaine
In my kitchen, you never listen, I hope you′re missing me by now
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You&amp;rsquo;d be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)</description>

        <description>Come on, Harry, we wanna say &amp;ldquo;good night&amp;rdquo; to you!
Holding me back
Gravity′s holding me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don&amp;rsquo;t we leave it at that?
Nothing to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I′m the one who will stay
Oh-oh-oh
In this world
It&amp;rsquo;s just us
You know it&amp;rsquo;s not the same as it was</description>

        <description>One, two, three
One, two
Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There′s never been someone who&amp;rsquo;s so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
&amp;ldquo;Give me something old and red&amp;rdquo;
I pay for it more than I did back then
There′s just no getting through</description>

        <description>Things haven′t been quite the same
There&amp;rsquo;s a haze on the horizon, baby
It′s only been a couple of days and I miss you
Yeah
When nothin&amp;rsquo; really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I&amp;rsquo;ll do everythin′ I can to help you through
If you′re feelin&amp;rsquo; down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby</description>

        <description>Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, yeah (oh)
You′re sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted &amp;lsquo;round your tongue
I don′t want you to get lost
I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to go broke
I want you
It&amp;rsquo;s ′cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way</description>

        <description>She′s a wonder woman
She knows what she likes
Never know she&amp;rsquo;s broken
′Cause she&amp;rsquo;s always fine
She&amp;rsquo;s a million moments
Lived a thousand lives
Never know she′s hopeless
Only when she cries
When her favorite record′s on and she&amp;rsquo;s dancing in the dark
She can′t stop her eyes from welling up, up
She makes sure that no one&amp;rsquo;s ′round to see her fall apart
She wants to be the one that never does</description>

        <description>I′m on an island, dirty dancing in the sun
So close to heaven but so far from everyone
Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I′m still wishing for all the love that I don&amp;rsquo;t have
Mama told me, &amp;ldquo;Girl, smoke &amp;rsquo;em if you got ′em&amp;rdquo;
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I′m sitting here wondering all day long
Am I stranded on an island?</description>

        <description>Do you wanna play house? I could be your wife
Go and meet your mom in a dress too tight
Maybe I could stay and not break your heart
But don′t forget, baby, I&amp;rsquo;m a wildcard
I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough
Don′t wait for me
&amp;lsquo;Cause forever may never come
I&amp;rsquo;m a wildcard, oh-ooh
Loving you is never enough
I′m a wildcard, oh-ooh</description>

Who the hell you think you&amp;rsquo;re messing with
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit
And I don′t know
Who the hell you think you&amp;rsquo;re messing with
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit
And you smell like perfume that I didn&amp;rsquo;t purchase</description>

        <description>When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don′t wanna leave
And your phone is lost
But the car&amp;rsquo;s outside waitin out on the street
Tonight we′ll just be wrong
Ain&amp;rsquo;t done this in so long
We ain&amp;rsquo;t gotta talk baby
We′ll keep the stereo on
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don′t wanna leave
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me</description>

        <description>I got a new dress just to meet you downtown
Can you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop
Heart beats so loud that it′s drownin&amp;rsquo; me out
Livin′ in an April shower
You&amp;rsquo;re pourin&amp;rsquo; down, baby, drown me out (ooh-ooh, ooh)
You′re just like a river (ooh-ooh, ooh)</description>

        <description>We met each other on the neon dinghy
Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beam down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
In the sky, we could see the riders on horseback
On comets, coming toward us, kicking up with laughter
My friend, Big Twitchy, rode the boat into the light
Surfed the NorthBreak
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy, ′cause that&amp;rsquo;s all we knew</description>

        <description>I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards
Smoke Cuban cigars and get kicked out of bars before two
But only if it′s with you
I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it&amp;rsquo;s with you
I got some baggage, let′s do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage</description>

        <description>Amazing
I′m driving around town in a beat up old Mercedes
You think I&amp;rsquo;m crazy
You might be right
But when he smiles, I don′t care about the past
Just like that
I told myself I closed that door, but I&amp;rsquo;m right back here again
I know half of what I&amp;rsquo;m saying don′t make no sense,
So don′t ask me where I been
I&amp;rsquo;m not always right
But still I ain′t got time for what went wrong</description>

        <description>Sunrise got us up early
So we put on our shade
Somehow the bedsheets are dirty
Like sticky sweet lemonade
Never wanna leave this room
Daydream, déjà vu
If I had control over you
We could stay like this forever, lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds, fallin′ stupid like we&amp;rsquo;re kids
Wearin′ rose colored lenses, let&amp;rsquo;s just play pretend
Wearin&amp;rsquo; rose colored lenses, pretend we′ll never end</description>

        <description>I don′t wanna call and talk too long
I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve had time to think it over
We′re much older and the bone&amp;rsquo;s too big to bury
Oh, isn&amp;rsquo;t it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to hell, but we never came back
I′m sorry that you′re jaded
I could&amp;rsquo;ve taken you places</description>

        <description>We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can′t be sold
We were right &amp;rsquo;til we weren′t
Built a home and watched it burn
Mmm, I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna leave you, I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered, I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don′t understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand</description>

        <description>I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin&amp;rsquo; on
They say that if it&amp;rsquo;s right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by</description>

        <description>I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I′ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I&amp;rsquo;ll watch as you′re leaving</description>

        <description>Baby love, I think I′ve been a little too kind
Didn&amp;rsquo;t notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works
When you′re in their top 5
And by the way
I&amp;rsquo;m going out tonight
Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band</description>

        <description>No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause it′s all over now
All out to sea
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to pine about
I′ve got a lot to live without
I&amp;rsquo;m never gonna meet</description>

        <description>Dear reader
If it feels like a trap
You′re already in one
Dear reader
Get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader
Burn all the files, desert all your past lives
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize yourself
That means you did it right
Never take advice from someone who′s falling apart
Never take advice from someone who&amp;rsquo;s falling apart
Dear reader
Bend when you can
Snap when you have to</description>

        <description>We were supposed to be just friends
You don′t live in my part of town, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I′m in
And what&amp;rsquo;s in my system
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch
Five seconds later, I′m fastening myself to you with a stitch
And I′m not even sorry
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit</description>

        <description>Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn′t know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was
Freeloading
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you were keeping count
High infidelity
Put on your records
And regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around
Dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones
And burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives</description>

        <description>You′re talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you&amp;rsquo;re relevant
You′re terrified to look down
&amp;lsquo;Cause if you dare, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It′s coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn′t know what I mean
&amp;lsquo;Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend</description>

        <description>It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through
Breathe deep, breathe out
I′ll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can&amp;rsquo;t last
Uh oh, I′m falling in love
Oh no, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love again
Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love
I thought the plane was going down</description>

        <description>Meet me at midnight&amp;hellip;
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don′t ever say too much
And you don&amp;rsquo;t really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I′m damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me</description>

        <description>When the morning came we
Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf ′cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;d we end up on the floor anyway?&amp;rdquo;
You say
&amp;ldquo;Your roommate′s cheap-ass screw top rosé
That&amp;rsquo;s how&amp;rdquo;
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes</description>

        <description>Once upon a time
The planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn′t lose
What if I told you
None of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me</description>

        <description>Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart ′cause he was nice</description>

        <description>Your ex-friend′s sister met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t but thanks though
I′m so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the news
Cause we were somewhere else</description>

        <description>I remember
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
′Cause I don&amp;rsquo;t remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I′ve searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin&amp;rsquo; situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?</description>

        <description>One night a few moons ago I
Saw flecks of what could′ve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can&amp;rsquo;t stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I′m unglued - thanks to you
And it&amp;rsquo;s like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin&amp;rsquo; beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful</description>

        <description>I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh&amp;hellip;
They said the end is coming
Everyone′s up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings
Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving
You′re in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was</description>

        <description>My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
All that bloodshed
Crimson clover
Uh huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War</description>

        <description>Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I′m the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don&amp;rsquo;t dress for women
I don′t dress for men
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dressing for revenge
I don&amp;rsquo;t start shit but I can tell you how it ends
Don′t get sad, get even</description>

        <description>If you would′ve blinked, then I would&amp;rsquo;ve
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could′ve
Spit me out at the first chance
If I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands
Oh, all I used to do was pray
Would&amp;rsquo;ve, could&amp;rsquo;ve, should′ve
If you′d never looked my way</description>

        <description>Summer went away
Still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He′s gonna notice me
It&amp;rsquo;s okay, we′re the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice
You&amp;rsquo;re smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it&amp;rsquo;s your face
I didn′t choose this town
I dream of getting out
There′s just one who could make me stay
All my days</description>
