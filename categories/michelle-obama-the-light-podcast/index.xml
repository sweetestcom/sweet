        <description>Higher Ground and Audible Originals present Michelle Obama, The Light Podcast.
Thank you so much! Hi! Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to be here. I have to be honest, I stopped filming my show in May,
and I haven&amp;rsquo;t really spoken to anyone or done anything for however many months that is.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to anyone, and my poor show once in a while,
but mostly I&amp;rsquo;m talking to my dogs all day long, so this could get weird.</description>

Everybody in the crowd&amp;rsquo;s there because they wanted to see me.
This is—thanks, two people.</description>
