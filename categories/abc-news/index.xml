        <description>So you are the CEO of OpenAI, 37 years old.
Your company is the maker of ChatGPT,
which has taken the world by storm.
Why do you think it&amp;rsquo;s captured people&amp;rsquo;s imagination?
I think people really have fun with it
and they see the possibility
and they see the ways this can help them,
this can inspire them,
this can help people create,
help people learn,
help people do all of these different tasks.</description>
