I want to talk about the economy today.
At any given moment.
There are like 1,000 things going on in the US economy, the unemployment rates doing this, and the stock, market&amp;rsquo;s doing that and Retail inflation or over here, doing their own thing.
It is a big messy, complicated story, but somehow when that big messy, complicated story is filtered through the media message making machine.
