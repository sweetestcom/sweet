Today&amp;rsquo;s podcast episode is all about sleep.
We&amp;rsquo;re also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep,
which is wakefulness.
Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and wakefulness,
govern everything about our mental and physical health.</description>

Welcome, I&amp;rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,
and I&amp;rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine.
That&amp;rsquo;s what I do for my day job,
but over the last few years,
I&amp;rsquo;ve become very active in teaching neuroscience
and neuroscience-related themes on social media.
And I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate enough to be hosted
as a guest on various people&amp;rsquo;s podcasts</description>
