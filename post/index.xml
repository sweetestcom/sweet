People from both sides of the competition

Five mill on YouTube in 30 days, never been done before.

I accidentally gave all my money away to Twitch streamers
and now I&amp;rsquo;m homeless.
And on top of that, UMG keeps taking all my revenue.
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to go buy a Lamborghini,
so I can make this viral video
and then have money and not be homeless.
unless UMG claims it again.
There&amp;rsquo;s Jimmy.
How&amp;rsquo;s it going, man?
Good.
Good, welcome Lamborghini.
Thank you.</description>

They give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security, self esteem and happiness. Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.
But maybe you have scrolled through your phone, unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with or ask for comfort.</description>

What is a thing?
Why do things happen?
And why do they happen the way they do?
Let’s try to approach this step-by-step.
What are you made of?
You are matter which is made of molecules
which are made of atoms and those are made of elementary particles.
But if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist,

Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable: Shooting nuclear waste into space. It is one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with nuclear energy.

declared drug abuse public enemy number one,
starting an unprecedented global campaign, the War on Drugs.
Today, the numbers are in.
The War on Drugs is a huge failure, with devastating unintended consequences.
It led to mass incarceration in the US;
to corruption, political destabilization, and violence
in Latin America, Asia, and Africa;
to systemic human rights abuses across the world.</description>

Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city on a continent on a planet orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions. But… where is all of that?

Some people have become zillionaires thanks to the internet.
But all they did was invent clever ways of using the internet.
So the person who “invented the internet” should be a gazillionaire
equivalent to, say, God, shoudn&amp;rsquo;t they?
Who should get the credit, then?
Was it a British geek in a Swiss underground lab?
Maybe.
Clever Americans threatened with nuclear annihilation by the Russians?</description>

Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets and trees, rocks and us.
This matter accounts for less than 5% of the known universe.
About 25% is dark matter; and 70% is dark energy.
Both of which are invisible.
This is kind of strange because it suggests that everything we experience is
really only a tiny fraction of reality.
But it gets worse.
We really have no clue what dark matter and energy are, or how they work.</description>

In a nutshell
Light, is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported
A photon, an elementary particle without a real size
That can&amp;rsquo;t be split, only created or destroyed.
Light also has a wave-particle duality

Large animals seem to be immune to cancer,

There&amp;rsquo;s a visceral joy in blowing things up,

earthquakes would level countries,
new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter.
Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart?
Or thrown out of orbit?

Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages are just the best things!
Eating meat has become so trivial that many people
don&amp;rsquo;t consider something a proper meal if there&amp;rsquo;s no animal involved.
Which is pretty amazing,
since only a few decades ago meat was a luxury product.
Today, you can get a cheeseburger for a dollar.
Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the most inefficient way of feeding humans.</description>

It started orderly and got more and more chaotic over time.
By investing energy, you can create order and clean it up.

That figure seems to validate the worries of congressional Republicans about government spending, which have been at the center of the messy fight over who should be House speaker.
Jim Tankersley, who covers economic policy at the White House for The Times, explains the Republicans’ concerns — and why their plans would not come close to solving the problem.</description>

Even with sci-fi technology, we are trapped in a limited pocket of the Universe and the finite stuff within it. How much universe is there for us and how far can we go?

from a skyscraper onto something soft.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say, a stack of mattresses.
The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment,
before it shakes itself off,
and walks away pretty annoyed,
because that&amp;rsquo;s a very rude thing to do.
The dog breaks all of its bones
and dies in an unspectacular way,

Stripped to its core meaning,
consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state.
But thinking about consciousness has this habit of taking us round in circles.
We all intuitively know what consciousness is.
It&amp;rsquo;s this&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing here, right now.
But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is, it leaves us grasping at thin air.</description>

In their cores, we might find the most dangerous substance in existence:
Strange matter.
A bizarre thing so extreme,

While scientists, activists and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to do anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Today we are answering an age-old very scientific and important question: What if the moon crashes into earth? It’s more interesting and weird than you probably think. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basics: Why isn&amp;rsquo;t the Moon on its way to crash into us already?
We know that earth’s gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon, but somehow, it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force. But there is no other force countering gravity - instead, the trick to staying up is a ‘sideways’ motion that we call an orbit.</description>

The Big Bang.
The idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not infinite.
Up to the middle of the 20th century, most scientists thought of the universe
as infinite and ageless.
Until Einstein’s theory of relativity gave us a better understanding of gravity,
and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another
in a way that fits previous predictions.</description>

That surviving a disease leaves you better off.
And it seems to make sense because we have all experienced this.
When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult
situation in the future.
But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.</description>

and a hull.
It has no ability to do anything
by itself whatsoever,

Just a small fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies, while the rest is thought to be drifting in between, in the intergalactic medium. Like the roots of some massive tree, gas spreads out from each galaxy, gravity funneling fresh mass into this dense, cosmic forest. Here in the intergalactic medium, are the raw materials of creation: hydrogen and helium, woven into sheets and filaments that flow into galaxies where they eventually create stars.</description>

pretty tiny.
Although, tiny is a matter of opinion.
Their surface area is up close to some of the smallest states on Earth,
like Luxembourg and Malta.
Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight,
In reality their gravitational pull isn&amp;rsquo;t even strong enough to bring them into spherical form.</description>

The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless that it compelled humankind, for the first time, to act truly globally. It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature, all made possible by… cows. Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself.</description>

But humans have always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on.
This is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendents.</description>

until new discoveries brought us more food,

In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled.
This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth.
But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.
Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.
The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.</description>

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿When the gods granted king Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would turn to gold.
Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings all gold.
But soon he found in horror that his food turned into gold as well.
When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain, he realized his mistake too late.
The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken and alone.

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Quantum Computers Explained – Limits of Human Technology
For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.
While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons,
the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.
Since the 1960&amp;rsquo;s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially,
allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.
But this process is about to meet its physical limits.</description>

While some argue against it, others swear by its great power and effectiveness.
How does homeopathy work?
How did it become what it is today, and what can modern medicine learn from it?
The first principle of homeopathy is &amp;ldquo;like cures like.&amp;rdquo;
Remedies use ingredients that cause the symptoms you want to cure.

        <description>Video Transcript ﻿Mechanisms of evolution
What is evolution?
Evolution is the development of life on Earth.
This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day.
Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop.
It shows us how primitive Protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today.
Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a Daschund and a Great Dane together:</description>

Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around
30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.
This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.
This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.
Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Where did it come from? More than three years into the pandemic with untold millions of people dead, that question about the origin of Covid-19 remains widely disputed and fraught, with facts sparkling amid a tangle of analyses and hypotheticals like Christmas lights strung on a dark, thorny tree.

        <description>Podcast Description Last October, the United States Bureau of Industry and Security issued a document that, underneath its 139 pages of dense bureaucratic jargon and minute technical detail, amounted to a declaration of economic war on China. The magnitude of the act was made all the more remarkable by the relative obscurity of its source.
In recent years, semiconductor chips have become central to the bureau’s work. Despite the immense intricacy of their design, semiconductors are, in a sense, quite simple: tiny pieces of silicon carved with arrays of circuits.</description>

Dean started asking the physicians she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of them confided that they were struggling.</description>

Some of the patients screamed out in the procedure room. Others called the clinic from home to report pain in the hours that followed. But most of the staff members who fielded the patients’ reports did not know the real reason for the pain — a nurse at the clinic was stealing fentanyl and replacing it with saline.</description>

He’s a kind of Urkel character, embarrassing comic relief that isn’t so funny for the people who have to live with him — a cruel marionette pieced together from ugly stereotypes.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When the former secretary of state and C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo, a man who had dealt firsthand with autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, described Randi Weingarten as “the most dangerous person in the world” last November, it seemed as though he couldn’t possibly be serious.
Weingarten is 65 and just over five feet tall. She is Jewish and openly gay — she’s married to a rabbi — and lives in Upper Manhattan.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210137/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description About 50 years ago, the educator Lucy Calkins pioneered a technique called balanced literacy, which de-emphasized the use of phonics to teach reading. It was widely adopted in the United States, including in New York, the country’s largest public school system.
But doubts about the approach persisted, and now it seems that using balanced literacy has given a generation of American students the wrong tools.
Dana Goldstein, who covers family policy and demographics for The Times, discusses the story of balanced literacy and how Professor Calkins is trying to fix the problems that the technique created.</description>

Attention.
So my apologies if today&amp;rsquo;s show sounds a little like you&amp;rsquo;re joining a conversation that&amp;rsquo;s
already in progress, but this has happened with me before where I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking with
someone about something, usually over a long period of time, messaging back and forth or
whatever it might be, and I&amp;rsquo;ll think to myself, usually a little too late in the game, wow,
you know, should have thought about making this a podcast.</description>

So, I have a friend that moved into a new house.
Okay.
And she built, decorated furniture, wallpaper, all that.
I mean, she was not going to hire a designer because her taste is so good.</description>

Since then, it has waged a relentless campaign of repression, putting Russian citizens in jail for offenses as small as holding a poster or sharing a news article on social media.
Valerie Hopkins, an international correspondent for The Times, tells the story of Olesya Krivtsova, a 19-year-old student who faces up to 10 years in prison after posting on social media, and explains why the Russian government is so determined to silence those like her.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains descriptions of severe injuries.
Tough new border policies introduced by the Biden administration have sharply reduced the number of migrants crossing into the United States. But the measures have also created a combustible bottleneck along the southern border. That situation exploded last week when a deadly fire broke out at a detention center in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.
Simon Romero, a national correspondent for The Times, explains how the United States has leaned more heavily on Mexico to help handle its immigration dilemma, bringing cities like Juárez to a breaking point.</description>

        <description>Hey, everyone. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the all-in pod.
Your illustrious moderator, Jason Kalkanis, has been purged.
Canceled?
He&amp;rsquo;s been canceled. We canceled him for his constant interruptions and low IQ comments.
We decided that the minimum IQ required to be on this pod is 140, 150.
He did not make the cut. And so now, it is just me, Chamath, and Freeberg.
He is, uh, Jason is away. He is actively implementing our jerk-off-to-win strategy to solve the pandemic and free speech.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Joe Faillace, 69, has been running the sandwich shop Old Station Subs alongside his wife, Debbie, for the last four decades. But as an epidemic of unsheltered homelessness began to overwhelm Phoenix, and many other major American downtowns, the Faillaces have been met with hundreds of people sleeping within a few blocks of Old Station. Many of them were suffering from mental illness or substance abuse, resulting in incidents such as pilfered goods and public masturbation.</description>

ecosystem a lot more lately, and there&amp;rsquo;s people
who probably didn&amp;rsquo;t even really know what a

Can you give me a very basic definition of what
Nvidia is?
Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s an easy question.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s the 1920s a young man is heading to the hospital.
As soon as he arrives, he&amp;rsquo;s rushed into surgery.
A damp towel is draped over his head.
An incision is made on his wrist, an artery exposed.

But this man, he&amp;rsquo;s not the actual patient beside him.
Doctors are more concerned with someone else in the next bed over surgeons hover over a still body.
Seemingly unconscious a doctor turns back to the young man, grabs his arm and connects is exposed artery to the unresponsive Patient.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Three years after the start of Covid, the central mystery of the pandemic — how exactly it began — remains unsolved. But recently, the debate about the source of the coronavirus has re-emerged, this time in Congress.
The Energy Department has concluded, with “low confidence,” that an accidental laboratory leak in China was most likely the origin, but politics are making it harder to find definitive answers.

Investigators chased leads and interviewed suspects, utilizing every resource at their

        <description>Podcast Description With federal regulators planning to take over the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank, a 40-year-old institution based in California, nearly $175 billion in customer deposits will be placed under the authorities’ control.
The lender’s demise is the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history and the largest since the financial crisis in 2008. The debacle raised concerns that other banks could face problems, too.

        <description>Podcast Description The principle behind E.S.G. is that investors should look beyond just whether a company can make a profit and take into account other factors, such as its environmental impact and action on social issues.
But critics of that investment strategy, mostly Republicans, say that Wall Street has taken a sharp left turn, attacking what they term “woke capitalism.”

        <description>Podcast Description After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany told Parliament that the attack was a Zeitenwende — a historic “turning point” for Europe and Germany. The risk of a large land war in Europe had previously been considered far-fetched, but recent years of Russian aggression have inspired fear in Germany and a 100-billion-euro fund to bolster its military.
In Germany, skepticism of the merits of military strength has enabled a long post-Cold War process of disarmament.</description>

        <description>Little freak, Jezebel
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze, crystal ball
Somehow, you′ve become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
I was thinkin&amp;rsquo; about who you are
Your delicate point of view, I
Was thinkin′ about you
I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to, I&amp;rsquo;m</description>

        <description>I′m on the roof, you&amp;rsquo;re in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleeding, looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope, you were just doing cocaine
In my kitchen, you never listen, I hope you′re missing me by now
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You&amp;rsquo;d be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)</description>

        <description>Come on, Harry, we wanna say &amp;ldquo;good night&amp;rdquo; to you!
Holding me back
Gravity′s holding me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don&amp;rsquo;t we leave it at that?
Nothing to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I′m the one who will stay
Oh-oh-oh
In this world
It&amp;rsquo;s just us
You know it&amp;rsquo;s not the same as it was</description>

One, two
Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There′s never been someone who&amp;rsquo;s so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
&amp;ldquo;Give me something old and red&amp;rdquo;
I pay for it more than I did back then
There′s just no getting through</description>

It′s only been a couple of days and I miss you
Yeah

You stub your toe or break your camera
I&amp;rsquo;ll do everythin′ I can to help you through
If you′re feelin&amp;rsquo; down, I just wanna make you happier, baby

She knows what she likes
Never know she&amp;rsquo;s broken
′Cause she&amp;rsquo;s always fine
She&amp;rsquo;s a million moments
Lived a thousand lives
Never know she′s hopeless
Only when she cries
When her favorite record′s on and she&amp;rsquo;s dancing in the dark
She can′t stop her eyes from welling up, up
She makes sure that no one&amp;rsquo;s ′round to see her fall apart
She wants to be the one that never does</description>

So close to heaven but so far from everyone
Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I′m still wishing for all the love that I don&amp;rsquo;t have
Mama told me, &amp;ldquo;Girl, smoke &amp;rsquo;em if you got ′em&amp;rdquo;
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I′m sitting here wondering all day long
Am I stranded on an island?</description>

Don′t wait for me

Like, it’s like, I mean, all innovation around us is like – it comes from companies. It comes from journeys, it comes from – like entrepreneurships and builders getting together.</description>

Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beam down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
In the sky, we could see the riders on horseback
On comets, coming toward us, kicking up with laughter
My friend, Big Twitchy, rode the boat into the light
Surfed the NorthBreak
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy, ′cause that&amp;rsquo;s all we knew</description>

Smoke Cuban cigars and get kicked out of bars before two
But only if it′s with you
I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it&amp;rsquo;s with you
I got some baggage, let′s do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage</description>

I told myself I closed that door, but I&amp;rsquo;m right back here again
I know half of what I&amp;rsquo;m saying don′t make no sense,
So don′t ask me where I been
I&amp;rsquo;m not always right

        <description>Podcast Description Almost immediately after taking power in December, Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition in Isreal proposed a highly contentious overhaul of the Supreme Court.
The court has long been seen as a crucial check and lone backstop on the government, and the plan has divided Israeli society, kindling fears of political violence and even civil war.

Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to hell, but we never came back

Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don′t understand

        <description>As of last summer, authorities have Ron Hulse&amp;rsquo;s DNA swab.
They agreed to do a direct comparison test against the partial male profile found on Darlene&amp;rsquo;s blouse.
Not because Ron is a suspect, but because he&amp;rsquo;s her husband.
If that DNA belongs to Ron, then it actually means the profile is kind of useless.
Maybe it was from their hug goodbye that morning when he went to work,
in which case it means that we need to start testing other items while we still can to get a suspect sample.</description>

        <description>For almost four decades, no one questioned Darlene&amp;rsquo;s cause of death.
And honestly, at first, neither did we.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t set out to debunk the cause of death in Darlene&amp;rsquo;s case, but when we went
through the pathologist&amp;rsquo;s 1984 findings, a few things just didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that we thought the report was wrong or that we knew more than a trained
pathologist.
In fact, it was the opposite.</description>

        <description>When we made the discovery about the Parson family,
it made us question everything Nelson had told us so far.
And again, Lemon and Parson are pseudonyms
because these guys have never publicly been named suspects by law enforcement.
So to see if this was just some kind of huge mix-up,
we first reached out to a former employee of Nelson&amp;rsquo;s
who Emily had interviewed prior.
She&amp;rsquo;s actually the one who was assigned to be the liaison</description>

        <description>About a year before we got involved with Darlene&amp;rsquo;s case,
her family worked with a private investigator, Patrick Zirpoli,
who goes by Zip to those who know him.
Zip spent his career with the Pennsylvania State Police.
He retired in 2015 as a corporal and the unit supervisor
of the Criminal Investigation Assessment Unit.
One of his specialties is cold case homicide investigations,
and after retirement, he&amp;rsquo;s gone on to consult in cold cases.</description>

        <description>In any good investigation, you&amp;rsquo;re running down multiple leads at once.
It&amp;rsquo;s not just a time efficiency thing, it&amp;rsquo;s what helps you avoid getting tunnel vision.
So one of the times we met with Nelson, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just Kenneth McCune Jr.&amp;rsquo;s name that
we brought up.
We also asked him about another name.
We said, hey, what do you know about John Paul Clark?
Did your office ever seriously look at him?</description>

        <description>Everyone from the current prosecutor to the FBI back in 87 say the same thing.
Look at where her body was found.
Her killer knew the area, knew where he was going to take her.
If that&amp;rsquo;s true, we decided to see what the land would tell us.
So we pulled the deed records for the lot where Darlene was found, and we looked at
parcels around it.
And sure enough, right up the road is McCune Farms, LLC.</description>

        <description>We&amp;rsquo;re just a mile south of Plymouth on Old 31 headed south to Argus.
Argus is about 15 minutes south of Plymouth, and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just cornfields and backroads
between the two towns.
Once you turn off of New US 31 onto Old Highway 31, you cross some railroad tracks, and a
few miles south of there, you pass right by Brandi Peltz&amp;rsquo;s old house, where she was
murdered in 1986.</description>

cold case into her own hands.
It got to a point about seven years ago where I was like, okay, I want to do this.
I was sitting at home with little kids and I just started reaching out like, hey, is

        <description>By January 1987, Marshall County authorities were noticing a pattern emerging.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt read from Sergeant Dave Yokelet&amp;rsquo;s case summary.
In the past several years, since 1982, this officer has been involved in the investigating
of several violent crimes that have occurred in the extreme southern portion of Marshall
County, Indiana.
Two of those crimes involved homicides, one of which was in 1984, the Hulse Homicide,
the other in 1986, the Peltz Homicide.</description>

        <description>Before moving on to other suspects, whose names were coming in via phone calls and letters
from the public, investigators knew what they had to do next—give Ron Hulse another polygraph
test.
I say another because they actually gave him one just three days after Darlene&amp;rsquo;s abduction,
which he passed.
And listen, Ron was never a suspect.
But back then, officers knew that they had to play offense and defense.</description>

        <description>On October 25th, 1984, all the way out in Amarillo, Texas,
a 29-year-old man named Ricky Mock went into a convenience store
and held the cashiers and guests at gunpoint, demanding money.
When he got what he was looking for, he took off,
only to be pulled over a few hours later
by an Amarillo officer who noticed his Indiana plates.
Ricky assumed that they knew it was him who robbed the place,</description>

A man named Jim Garman suggested they check out the home of a woman named Thelma Burns.
He said there were a lot of quote-unquote druggies and creeps who stayed there.
When police went by to talk to him the next evening, this now being after Darlene&amp;rsquo;s body
had been found, Jim Garman&amp;rsquo;s tip had gotten even more specific, and it pointed the finger</description>

        <description>Walter Grosnickle finally had some free time on Saturday, August 18th, 1984 to make the
hour-long drive from his house in North Manchester, Indiana, to Argus to check out some land that
he&amp;rsquo;d been interested in buying for his timber operations.
This was actually the second time he had driven there to have a look, but he wanted to double
check the trees on the plot before he moved forward with actually buying it.</description>

The dirt roads off the highway aren&amp;rsquo;t well marked, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to do.
I even missed it my first time up there.
It took about .2 seconds for him to realize what he&amp;rsquo;d done and make a U-turn back toward the Hulse House,
which was just a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw away from the highway with a cornfield and a barn between.</description>

It was about an old unsolved murder that I had never heard of in a tiny Indiana town
that I had only ever passed on my way to somewhere else.

the next two years of my life living and breathing this case, dumping every resource I had into</description>

In 1984, mother of three Darlene was brutally attacked in her own home.
Nearly 40 years later, her daughters are still seeking answers,
and there are still new details to uncover.
So, we took our normal reporting one step further.

        <description>Argus, Indiana is small, more corn stalks than people in 1984.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of those places where neighbor means something different.
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s your neighbor, but each house is a corn or soybean field away.
The home of the Hulse family was just like that,
tucked away off a major road through town with fields to the front and back.
Ron Hulse built the home himself for his wife Darlene and their three daughters.</description>

In 1982, 23-year-old Deanna disappeared without a trace from a bar in South St. Paul, Minnesota.
Decades later, a deck of cards would lead to some closure for her family, but ultimately
leave everyone with more questions than answers.

        <description>NEAL STEPHENSON: I think I’m a little bit of a freak, even among writers. I hear other writers talking about self-discipline and writers block and the struggle. It’s not like that for me. I mean, I don’t mean to be egotistical or anything like that, but at no point in my career have I ever felt as though I were inflicting some kind of discipline on myself.

Because then, we would have so much more potential for applications.

        <description>STEVEN PINKER: It isn’t as if this universe contains some force called progress. That’s kind of mystical. In fact, if anything, the universe tries to grind us down. It’s constantly throwing pandemics at us, and – and natural disasters and entropy, things wearing down, and falling apart and rotting. To the extent that life gets better, it’s only because people have applied their ingenuity to try to make it better. We’ve invented antibiotics and vaccines, and intergovernmental organizations, and liberal democracies.</description>

PETER LEE: What we’re seeing today is that more and more, what we do, and even just to survive as a civilization depends on researchers and scientists being able to get drawn in and solve problems, respond to crises, help us become hopefully more resilient to the future. And that sort of crisis response science, I think, is getting to be incredibly important. And it won’t work if society doesn’t trust what we’re doing.</description>

STEVIE BATHICHE: A big part of invention, engineering, product development is managing complexity, and moving complexity around, in fact. Like, if you think about, high level, what we can do and if you understand the different systems and the different disciplines, you can effectively move complexity around where it’s hard in one area, but not so hard in another area.

The railroad company and local officials decided to do a chemical burn to neutralize the cargo, but as a giant plume of black smoke settled over the town, residents’ anger about the handling of the accident has intensified.

DAVID BAKER:
Generally, in engineering and biology, if you want to solve a problem, you go look in nature for a protein that already does something similar, and then you modify it a bit. The relationship between sequence and structure has been really mysterious, but now we can actually design proteins with intent to do new things. So, I think it’s just getting to be very exciting.

ASHLEY LLORENS: Can we start to set some audacious goals around enabling as many people as possible on the planet to live a long, healthy life, creating an atmosphere of shared prosperity, and what is the role of AI in doing that?

In Turkey, the government has turned the focus onto builders and property developers, accusing them of chasing profit over safety. But the reality is far more complicated.

        <description>Podcast Description After the 2020 election, wild theories ran rampant on the right of an election stolen from Donald Trump through a coordinated conspiracy. The news channel Fox News became one of the loudest voices amplifying these false claims into millions of U.S. households.
Now, a defamation lawsuit by Dominion, a voting machine maker that was cast as a villain in these conspiracy theories, seeks to hold the media company responsible for the false claims made by its hosts and guests, presenting evidence that Fox knew what it was doing was wrong.</description>

You can’t say, “Hey, you know, look, my car ran you over, it’s an AI car, I don’t know what it did, it’s not my fault, right?” You as the driver or maybe it’s the manufacturer if there’s some malfunction, but people have to be responsible for the behavior of the machines.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In February, the first lawsuit against Tesla for a crash involving its driver-assistance system, Autopilot, will go to trial. The slew of trials set to follow will be a costly fight that the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, has vowed to take on in court. When Tesla released its Autopilot feature in October 2015, Musk touted the feature as “probably better” than a human driver. The reality, however, has proved different: On average, there is at least one Autopilot-related crash in the United States every day.</description>

By some estimates, tens of thousands have died, and the country has sustained tens of billions of dollars’ worth of damage that has left cities flattened. But Ukraine has also largely stopped the offensives of its much larger and better-armed neighbor and has regained some captured land.
On the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, these Ukrainians reflect on how the past year of conflict has changed their lives.</description>

When Timothy&amp;rsquo;s body was found on the side of the road in 2005, investigators launched

Seventeen years later, Timothy&amp;rsquo;s mother persists in her search for justice, even with
the investigation being put on hold and overshadowed by a whirlwind of rumors that have only led</description>

SCOTT URMSON: People talk about Silicon Valley engineers being risk-takers. I think it’s actually the opposite. It’s the realization that if you go and try one of these things and you’re actually good at what you do, if it fails, it fails. You’ll have a job the next day at somewhere else, right? And you’ll have this wealth of experience that people will value.

International aid began pouring into Turkey, but northwestern Syria, which was also hard-hit, received only a trickle. It was a bitter blow for Syrians, whose lives had already been uprooted by years of civil war, mass displacement and death.
Today, we hear from some Syrians and look at why it is so difficult for the world to help them.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Viola Pendergrass, a wild card from North Carolina.
I felt compelled to tell you Viola&amp;rsquo;s story even though she&amp;rsquo;s not featured on a cold
case deck because she was the matriarch of not just her sprawling family, but also those
at the apartment complex where she&amp;rsquo;d lived for two decades.
Residents there even called her Ma.

The balloon, the U.S. military said, was part of a bigger global program by China to collect information about military operations.
Since then the U.S. has shot down three other objects from the skies over North America — apparently without knowing much about them.</description>

their two murders.

        <description>Podcast Description Menopausal hormone therapy was once the most commonly prescribed treatment in the United States. In the late 1990s, some 15 million women a year were receiving a prescription for it. But in 2002, a single study, its design imperfect, found links between hormone therapy and elevated health risks for women of all ages. Panic set in; in one year, the number of prescriptions plummeted.
Hormone therapy carries risks, to be sure, as do many medications that people take to relieve serious discomfort, but dozens of studies since 2002 have provided reassurance that for healthy women under 60 whose hot flashes are troubling them, the benefits of taking hormones outweigh the risks.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On Monday, a giant 7.8-magnitude earthquake and an aftershock almost as big shook the earth in southern Turkey. The quakes sent ripples through neighboring countries, but the area along the Syrian-Turkish border was hit particularly hard.
Thousands of people have been killed, and dozens of cities have been gutted.
We hear from witnesses on the ground about what happened when the devastating tremors hit.
Guest: Ben Hubbard, the Istanbul bureau chief for The New York Times.</description>

It is framed as a debate,
but with the goal of having a nuanced conversation
talking with each other, not at each other.
I hope to continue having debates like these,
including on controversial topics.
I believe in the power of conversation

not to convince one side or the other,</description>

Mr. Tamariz, 80, has been a professional magician for 52 years, and in that time, he has managed the singular feat of becoming both a household name in his home country and a living legend in magic everywhere.</description>

Forty-two years have passed since Frankie was left for dead in a southeastern Massachusetts
gravel pit.
Frankie&amp;rsquo;s case is unique in a lot of ways, but one reason is because her story straddles
the state line of Rhode Island, where she was last seen alive, and Massachusetts, where
her body was found, which complicated the investigation from the get-go.</description>

        <description>ANDREW NG: With the rise of technology often comes greater concentration of power in smaller numbers of people&amp;rsquo;s hands, and I think that this creates greater risk of ever-growing wealth inequality as well. To be really candid, I think that with the rise of the last few ways of technology, we actually did a great job creating wealth in the East and the West Coast, but we actually did leave large parts of the country behind, and I would love for this next one to bring everyone along with us.</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Jennifer Lynn, the Queen of Hearts from California.
In 1994, the brutal murder of 14-year-old Jenny inside her parents&amp;rsquo; safe suburban
house left a community shaken to its core, because not only had a bright and talented
life been suddenly snuffed out, but police struggled to find a motive.
And the more clues they uncovered, the more investigators realized the nightmare they
were dealing with.</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until about senior year in high school when I realized what I could do with it. I have a little brother, and so I made it so that when he tried to log into the computer, it would just beep really loudly. And then it would put up this huge ASCII warning error that was like &amp;ldquo;Intruder, intruder.</description>

But that process could soon be overhauled. In a coming meeting of the Democratic National Committee, South Carolina — a state that is more representative of the party and, possibly, of the country — could take over the key role of going first.

It broke my heart when I first heard about what happened to Marjorie and her son,
so even though they&amp;rsquo;re not featured on a cold case card in Colorado,
I knew we had to tell you their story.
And not just because it is so devastating,
but because nearly 50 years have gone by since Marjorie&amp;rsquo;s murder,
and some of the stories surrounding her death are as confusing today as they were back then.</description>

Back in the 40s and 50s writer.
William esper has helped create the Beat Generation which was a counterculture movement, the documented drug culture and inspired generations of artists.

        <description>Gabrielle Union: Depending on what&amp;rsquo;s happening that day, sometimes I need a walk to find clarity. There&amp;rsquo;s challenges that we face that you just can&amp;rsquo;t quite figure out the right approach or the right answer, or you know d*** well what the answer is, but you got to make peace with it. And, for me, fitness, walking, just moving every day in some kind of meaningful way brings me peace.</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210250/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In the past half-century, 17 percent of the Amazon — an area larger than Texas — has been converted to croplands or cattle pasture. Less forest means less recycled rain, less vapor to cool the air, less of a canopy to shield against sunlight. Under drier, hotter conditions, even the lushest of Amazonian trees will shed leaves to save water, inhibiting photosynthesis — a feedback loop that is only exacerbated by global warming.</description>

He was formerly the CTO of Coinbase and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. This conversation is over seven hours. For some folks, that&amp;rsquo;s too long. For some, too short. For some, just right. There are chapter timestamps, there are clips, so you can jump around or, like I prefer to do with podcasts and audiobooks I enjoy, you can sit down, relax with a loved human, animal, or consumable substance, or all three if you like, and enjoy the ride from start to finish.</description>

On a summer night in 1999, Darwin, a quirky intellectual
who was obsessed with studying spiders,
decided to go out to the bars with some friends
because he had just gotten some amazing news.
But after his final nightcap, Darwin wandered out the side door of a bar
and into a dark alley, triggering a mystery
that no one in 23 years has been able to solve.</description>

        <description>Naomi Campbell: I so appreciate walking now, especially since this past year. I remember last year when I came out to Los Angeles after not going past my door for three and half months in New York, just to put my feet on the grass, I cried. It was just like we take that for granted, don&amp;rsquo;t we?

Like, I feel like the whole world is going to just appreciate trees, air, oxygen, much more than they ever have before.</description>

Investigators have spent the last 11 years since determined to solve her murder.
And their work has led to major breakthroughs in recent years.

This year, both sides of the argument are dug in and Republicans appear more willing to go over the cliff than in the past.

        <description>Joan Benoit Samuelson: Well, a walk for me is really downtime, and I know that when I go for a walk with friends, I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes slowing them down because I… I tend to walk slowly. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m taking everything in or because I do so much running that it&amp;rsquo;s nice to change the speed by a huge measure.
​
And it&amp;rsquo;s my opportunity to commune with nature.</description>

        <description>you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,
like literally seventh best player.
But if you&amp;rsquo;re playing with the other six, you&amp;rsquo;re the sucker.
You are like the worst player in the game, right?
So like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of players, for example,
like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?

        <description>Podcast Description In a room in a modest concrete building in a leafy Minneapolis neighborhood is silence exceeding the bounds of human perception. Technically an “anechoic chamber,” the room is the quietest place on the planet — according to some.
What happens to people inside the windowless steel room is the subject of wild and terrible speculation. Public fascination with it exploded 10 years ago, with an article on The Daily Mail’s website.</description>

        <description>Randall Park: Walking is, for me, just this wonderful gift.
​
During the pandemic, I actually, for the first time in my life, experienced panic attacks. They were really jarring and scary for me. I started incorporating long walks into my life. They really make me feel more relaxed, more in touch with the Earth and the world. And it&amp;rsquo;s something that we all take for granted, including myself, far too often.</description>

Hey everybody, hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a good week. We are just beginning to dry out here in Marin
after weeks and weeks of rain. Speaking of misery, perhaps the biggest story this week is all of the
layoffs that have been taking place. On Wednesday, Microsoft sacked 10,000 employees, roughly 5% of
its workforce. And today, Google&amp;rsquo;s parent company, Alphabet, announced that it is laying off 12,000</description>

        <description>Our card this week is Bobby Joe Fritz,
the five of spades from Wisconsin.
When five-year-old Bobby Joe vanished
one afternoon in the early 80s,
no one suspected right away that he&amp;rsquo;d been abducted
because stuff like that just didn&amp;rsquo;t happen
in his tiny hometown.
But as days went by without any sign of the little boy,
the clues started to point to a worst case scenario
and revealed something much more sinister going on</description>

        <description>Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Walking, for me, represents, first of all, just the chance to feel like I have some control. I live a really busy life, and I think when you feel like you can go take a walk, it kind of… it sends a message, I think, to my whole way of thinking that I&amp;rsquo;ve regained some control. I can go for this walk. So I love that part of it.</description>

We lived at this little brick house in Wyckoff, New Jersey, two doors down from the church that my dad was the pastor at. And there was this back pathway through the woods that neighbored a cemetery. The cemetery was kind of frightening to me, but the time spent with my father walking down this back path, talking about life and music and creativity were some of my favorite memories growing up.</description>

And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,

One is because the investigation is still very active and new discoveries were made
while our team was reporting on Leah&amp;rsquo;s case.
Actual breakthroughs that could lead to her murder getting solved.
And the second reason is because Leah&amp;rsquo;s family,
who&amp;rsquo;s been waiting nearly 30 years for answers, talked to us for this episode.</description>

        <description>Jon M. Chu: Walking always grounds me. There&amp;rsquo;s a certain sound of the gravel, of the grass, of the leaves blowing and the rustling of the trees, and you can hear birds scatter in the bushes or lizards run across. And to me, those are the, the reminders that you&amp;rsquo;re not alone, that there is a planet and lives all around you and that you are one piece of this.</description>

You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.
It&amp;rsquo;s the culmination of your whole project for happiness,

That&amp;rsquo;s mortality.
Mortality isn&amp;rsquo;t just some far flung event.
It&amp;rsquo;s that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.
So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In states where abortion is severely limited or illegal, clinicians face imminent prosecution if they continue to provide abortions. What is much less clear is what happens if providers in blue states offer telemedicine abortions to women in states where that’s against the law. These clinicians, too, could be arrested or sued or lose their medical licenses. To protect themselves, they may have to give up traveling to certain parts of the country — and it’s still no guarantee.</description>

And as soon as I was old enough to walk with him, I walked every Sunday morning, just me and my father. I think it was probably three miles and then three miles home. He would never slow down for me.</description>

I also just have started walking around my neighborhood and found little cool, old houses from the &amp;rsquo;40s I never noticed before. One woman has a rose garden, and we started talking, and now I go visit her and her roses every day. So it&amp;rsquo;s a way of connecting with my community, too.

And physically our bodies are well attuned

this is not something that you ever evolved to do.

Today, how California’s water management in the past has made today’s flooding worse and why it represents a missed opportunity for the future of the state’s water crisis.

        <description>Anthony Ramos: You know, I love walking because I think there’s a, there&amp;rsquo;s a freedom… The body’s moving, your mind is flowing and you’re just allowing yourself to go wherever your mind and your body wants to go, without you putting any stipulations or restrictions on it.
​
That’s what’s kind of dope about just getting your body moving.

        <description>Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.
And if you gaze into the abyss,
the abyss gazes also into you.
But I would say, bring it on.
If you gaze into the abyss long enough,
you see the light, not the darkness.
Are you sure about that?
I&amp;rsquo;m betting my life on it.

        <description>Podcast Description After Jair Bolsonaro lost October’s Brazilian presidential election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, many believed that the threat of violence from the defeated leader’s supporters would recede. They were wrong.
Mr. Bolsonaro had spent years sewing doubt and undermining Brazil’s election system, and last week, thousands of rioters stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices.
What happened — and how did Brazil get here?

While every airline was affected, one stood out: Southwest, which over the past few decades has transformed how Americans fly, melted down. In the last 10 days of the year, it canceled as many flights as it had done in the previous 10 months.

        <description>Bubba Wallace: Being outside, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s the exact opposite of… of what I do in my, I guess, normal career life, going fast, turning left, turning right, whatever it may be. And being outside is slowing down, looking all around, enjoying the sights, enjoying the sounds.

It was all still keyboard.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t even have mice set up at that time,

The wall disappears in a little animation

        <description>Ibram X. Kendi: When I go for a walk, I think of it as a time in which I can think and I can figure out how to solve problems, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the problems of our time or problems that I&amp;rsquo;m facing within my own life. Going for a walk is a time to be still, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to really just be one with yourself. And in many ways, our lives are on overdrive, and there are times in which we really need to settle ourselves and focus ourselves and certainly when we go for a walk, we&amp;rsquo;re able to do that.</description>

When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, many believed the country’s army would quickly crush the Ukrainian forces. Instead, Russian military failures have defined the war.
Today, we hear from Russian soldiers, and explore why a military superpower keeps making the same mistakes and why, despite it all, its soldiers keep going back to fight.

He&amp;rsquo;s already laughing. This is the 10% Happier Podcast. I&amp;rsquo;m Dan Harris. Okay, so today is the big day. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Dharamsala for over a week and it is finally time for my sit down with his holiness, the Dalai Lama. I have flown across the world for this one hour audience, so the stakes feel pretty high. I will admit, I&amp;rsquo;m a little nervous. His holiness can be a bit of a tough nut to crack.</description>

where we discuss science
and science-based tools for everyday life.
I&amp;rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,
and I&amp;rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine.
This podcast is separate
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
It is, however, part of my desire and effort
to bring zero cost to consumer information
about science and science-related tools
to the general public.

        <description>Uzo Aduba: I love to walk, and when I first moved to New York I didn&amp;rsquo;t always have the money for the subway fare and would walk from the city home to Queens from my waiting job. But then it really became this private, personal opportunity to talk through with myself some of the conversations I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to have during the busy day. And so what I would find is that, at the end of my walks, I would usually have the answers to a lot of the questions or decisions that I was trying to make.</description>

        <description>no reason to think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon. And likewise, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to
think that the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,
there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.
It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there&amp;rsquo;s

        <description>Draymond Green: I try to go on a walk maybe once every couple weeks.
​
It&amp;rsquo;s your time to lose yourself in nature, free your thoughts, take all the great things that this world has to offer in and just breathe and kind of let everything out. All the daily stresses that we all go through, just go on your walk and kind of let them all out.

        <description>The real foundation of Marx&amp;rsquo;s political philosophy was the economic argument that there would
be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that tendency for the rate of profit to
fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder, paying them less than their
subsistence, a revolt by workers against this, and then you would get socialism on
the other side.

Before we get started with today&amp;rsquo;s show, I want to tell you about something really awesome that we&amp;rsquo;re doing around here. Back in October, I flew to India to spend a few weeks in Dharamsala. That&amp;rsquo;s a small city nestled at the foot of the Himalayas surrounded by beautiful cedar forests. It&amp;rsquo;s also home to Tenzin Gyatso, who you probably know as the 14th Dalai Lama. He has claimed that the purpose of life is to be happy.</description>

        <description>Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets.
Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple. These are exploitative
class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another
group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,
resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.</description>

        <description>Talking about an exciting thing for an engineer,
the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone
and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,
the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.
You expect to have a full day of battery life,
but then you want it to not be sending data
into 10 or 100 megabits.
You want gigabits.
You want it to be able to have eight core processors.</description>

        <description>If you get into the sauna the way I just described,
not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,
twice a week or three times per week,
you reduce the likelihood of dying
of a cardiovascular event by 27%.
If you do it four or more times per week,
you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.
Is there any scientific evidence
that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?</description>

Both parties have their own challenges: Republicans have a candidate quality issue in Mr. Walker, and Democrats are concerned about the turnout of their voter coalition. One side, though, already seems resigned to losing.

The pair explore the recent chain of personal and public events in Baumbach’s life, including the toll of the coronavirus pandemic and the death of his father, and how this “routine trauma” has affected his work, and why it prompted him to create a discombobulated, “elevated reality” for his film in the vein of David Lynch, the Coen brothers and Spike Lee.</description>

The 2022 World Cup has also been the focus of over a decade of controversy because of its unlikely host: the tiny, energy-rich country of Qatar.
How did such a small nation come to host the tournament, and at what cost?</description>

How far are people willing to go?
You can capture their location,
you can capture their contacts
that record their telephone calls, record their camera
without them knowing about it.
Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet
on someone without them knowing.

Hey guys, hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing well out there in your corner of the world.
It&amp;rsquo;s a holiday week here in the US Thanksgiving.
And for many, this is a time to gather the family around a turkey to pile plates, high and Gorge ourselves on family traditions all while practicing gratitude, but for other Americans, the fourth Thursday in November has a different significance.

“The task of shrinking our societal footprint is the most urgent problem of our era — and perhaps the most intractable,” writes Shannon, who explains that the problem of reducing our footprints further “isn’t that we don’t have models of sustainable living; it’s that few exist without poverty.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For the Democrats to hold on to power in Washington, they have to do what President Biden did in Pennsylvania two years ago: Break the Republican Party’s grip on the white working-class vote, once the core of the Democratic base.
In tomorrow’s midterm election, no race better encapsulates that challenge than the Pennsylvania Senate candidacy of John Fetterman.
Is the plan working or is this crucial group of voters now a lost cause for the Democrats?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The phenomenon of babies stolen from hospitals in Spain, once shrouded in secrecy, is now being spoken about.
The thefts happened during the end of the regime of Francisco Franco, the right-wing dictator who ruled the country until 1975, and even today the disappearances remain a subject of mystery and debate among scholars.
According to the birth mothers, nuns who worked in maternity wards took the infants shortly after they were delivered and told the women, who were often unwed or poor, that their children were stillborn.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This moment in politics will be defined by shifts at the grass-roots level. It wasn’t long ago that Democrats used to brag about the coalition they had built — full of young people, minority voters and college-educated women. Today, we talk to members of the Democratic base, many of whom no longer see a clear path forward for the party.
“The Run-Up” is a new politics podcast from The New York Times.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description For decades, many universities have used race as a factor when deciding which students to admit. In the past, the Supreme Court has backed that practice, called affirmative action, in the interest of creating a diverse student body.
This week, however, the majority-conservative court is considering a case that may change affirmative action forever.

        <description>The following is a conversation with Boris Sofman, who is the senior director of engineering and head of trucking at Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company, formerly the Google self driving car project.

I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that this case can be confusing. There&amp;rsquo;s so many players here. So I want to remind you what we&amp;rsquo;ve heard so far.

“An animal voyage,” Mr. Anderson writes, “is special because it requires us to make many journeys all at once.</description>

Actually, it was just drinks because this was when there was still so much uncertainty with COVID. We followed all the rules and we met friends at a distance. And while it was great to just have human interaction again. An even greater moment happened as we were leaving.

Despite being a blue state through and through, and a place President Donald J. Trump lost by 23 points two years ago, the red tide of this moment is lapping at New York’s shores.
Why is New York up for grabs?</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human
Rights Foundation and the Oslo Freedom Forum.
In recent times, Alex has focused on how cryptocurrency, and especially Bitcoin, can be a tool for
empowering democracy and civil liberties in the world, most crucially, parts of the world
that are living under authoritarian regimes.
As a side note, let me say that I have been learning a lot about the ways in which money</description>

        <description>I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin&amp;rsquo; on
They say that if it&amp;rsquo;s right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong
Oh, my, love is a lie

Princess Rhaenys:
It&amp;rsquo;s been near six years
since I last saw
my lord husband, Maester.
I must know&amp;hellip; will he live?
Maester Kelvyn:
He led his sailors into an ambush.
A ship made to look
as if it were abandoned.
In the fighting,
his neck was slashed by a corsair&amp;rsquo;s dagger.
He fell overboard into the sea.
The wound was severe.
Much blood was lost.</description>

        <description>I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I′ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I&amp;rsquo;ll watch as you′re leaving</description>

Didn&amp;rsquo;t notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works
When you′re in their top 5
And by the way
I&amp;rsquo;m going out tonight
Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band</description>

Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause it′s all over now
All out to sea
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to pine about
I′ve got a lot to live without

You don′t live in my part of town, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I′m in
And what&amp;rsquo;s in my system
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch
Five seconds later, I′m fastening myself to you with a stitch
And I′m not even sorry

Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn′t know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was
Freeloading
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you were keeping count
High infidelity
Put on your records
And regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around
Dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones
And burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives</description>

Addicted to betrayal, but you&amp;rsquo;re relevant
You′re terrified to look down
&amp;lsquo;Cause if you dare, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It′s coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn′t know what I mean

Karma is a god

Never trust it if it rises fast

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don′t ever say too much
And you don&amp;rsquo;t really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I′m damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal

Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf ′cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;d we end up on the floor anyway?&amp;rdquo;
You say
&amp;ldquo;Your roommate′s cheap-ass screw top rosé
That&amp;rsquo;s how&amp;rdquo;
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes</description>

        <description>Once upon a time
The planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn′t lose
What if I told you
None of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me</description>

I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart ′cause he was nice</description>

Did you see the photos?
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t but thanks though

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
′Cause I don&amp;rsquo;t remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I′ve searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin&amp;rsquo; situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?</description>

But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can&amp;rsquo;t stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I′m unglued - thanks to you

Everyone′s up to something

Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
All that bloodshed
Crimson clover
Uh huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War</description>

Jaehaerys, was failing.
In those days, House Targaryen

        <description>Podcast Description As the sun came up over Florida yesterday, a fuller picture began to emerge of the destruction that Hurricane Ian had inflicted on the state and its residents.
The Category 4 storm washed away roads, bridges, cars, boats and homes. The damage is so extensive that, according to the state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, it may take years to rebuild.

The anger over Ms. Amini’s death has prompted days of rage, exhilaration and street battles across Iran, with women stripping off their head scarves — and even burning them — in the most significant outpouring of dissent against the ruling system in more than a decade.</description>

But the funds came with few strings and minimal oversight. The result: one of the largest frauds in American history, with billions of dollars stolen by thousands of people.

        <description>Podcast Description The high poverty rate among children was long seen as an enduring fact of American life. But a recent analysis has shown that the number of young people growing up poor has fallen dramatically in the past few decades.
The reasons for the improvement are complicated, but they have their roots in a network of programs and support shaped by years of political conflict and compromise.

        <description>Podcast Description The concept of having a “body clock” is a familiar one, but less widespread is the awareness that our body contains several biological clocks. Understanding their whims and functions may help us optimize our lives and lead to better overall health, according to scientists.
Every physiological system is represented by a clock, from the liver to the lungs, and each one is synced “to the central clock in the brain like an orchestra section following its conductor,” writes Kim Tingley, a New York Times journalist who explored the effect this knowledge has on how conditions are treated, and spoke to scientists about how misalignment or deregulation of these clocks can have a profound effect on our health.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In kicking off the midterms, Joe Biden talked about American democracy as a shared value, enshrined in the country’s founding — a value that both Democrats and Republicans should join together in defending. But there is another possible view of this moment. One that is shared by two very different groups: the voters who propelled Biden to the presidency … and the conservative activists who are rejecting democracy altogether.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Last week, nearly 50 Venezuelan migrants showed up, without warning, on the wealthy island of Martha’s Vineyard.
Their arrival was the culmination of a monthslong strategy by two of the United States’ most conservative governors to lay the issue of undocumented immigration at Democrats’ doorstep.
How has this strategy played out and what has it meant for the migrants caught in the middle?
Guest: Miriam Jordan, a national correspondent covering immigration for The New York Times.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation between me and Michael Malus.
Michael is an author, anarchist, and simpleton, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to call him my friend.
He makes me smile, he makes me think, and he makes me wonder why I sound so sleepy all
the time.
And now, enjoy this conversation with Michael Malus in the Tupagalovi language that I&amp;rsquo;m
increasingly certain I&amp;rsquo;ll never quite able to get the hang of.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description “Nobody’s gonna know. They’re gonna know.”
If you’ve been on TikTok in the past year, you’re most likely familiar with these two sentences, first drolly uttered in a post by TikTok creator Chris Gleason in 2020. The post has become a hit and has been viewed more than 14 million times.
But the sound is more famous than the video.
When uploading a video to TikTok, the creator has the option to make that video’s audio a “sound” that other users can easily use in their own videos — lip-syncing to it, adding more noise on top of it or treating it like a soundtrack.</description>

A giant storehouse of the necessary resources sits at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. But retrieving them may, in turn, badly damage the environment.

        <description>Podcast Description When President Biden canceled college debt last month, he left untouched the problem that created that debt: the soaring price of college.
In the 1980s, the list price of undergraduate education at a private four-year institution could hit $20,000 a year. At some of these schools in the last couple of years, it has topped $80,000.
Why has a college education become increasingly costly, and why has that become such a difficult problem to solve?</description>

        <description>MEGHAN: When I was 14, I planned my wedding. Not my actual wedding. That would have been a bit harder to imagine. This wedding was an assignment for my Religion 2 class in Catholic school.
[MUSIC IN]
MEGHAN: I remember every little thing about it. I wanted it to be at The Bel-Air Hotel. And there was a swan lake, and I wanted the cake to be from Hanson’s Bakery. And the dress - oh my goodness, the dress was strapless and poofy and I’d seen it in a bridal magazine … and, and I bought it, I mean not, not the dress – I bought the bridal magazine because I took this project seriously.</description>

Houdini is a legend and the World of Magic.
And one of the most iconic Escape artists who&amp;rsquo;ve ever lived.
Certainly I know he is a personal hero of yours, he sure is.
And the reason I&amp;rsquo;m bringing him up today is because while magicians don&amp;rsquo;t usually reveal the secrets to their tricks, Houdini once went on a crusade against spiritualism to expose mediums and psychics as frauds.</description>

For Braxton Wright, 39, a second-generation coal miner and, until recently, a Republican, the experience has altered his view of American politics.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the past decade, planting trees has come to represent many things: a virtuous act, a practical solution and a symbol of hope in the face of climate change. But can planting a trillion trees really save the world?
Visiting the Eden Reforestation Projects in Goiás, Brazil, and interviewing numerous international scientists and activists, the journalist Zach St. George offers a vivid insight into the root of the tree-planting movement — from the Green Belt Movement of the 1970s to the Trillion Tree Campaign of the 2010s — and considers the concept’s environmental potential, as well as the movement’s shortcomings.</description>

But in reality, the court was ensuring that many states, from Arizona to Ohio, would immediately ban the procedure without much debate, because their legislatures are now dominated by hard-line Republicans. Today, we tell the story of how those Republican legislators achieved that dominance.</description>

The group was widely demonized. Its exploits were condemned by mainstream environmental groups, ridiculed by the media and inspired a furious crackdown from law enforcement.
But in 2022 the group is more relevant than ever. These days even America’s mainstream environmental movement has begun to take a more confrontational approach, having previously confined its activities largely to rallies, marches and other lawful forms of protest.</description>

The White House vowed to use “every tool” to bring Ms. Griner back to the United States, but organizing her release is a tricky proposition, complicated not least by Washington’s break with Moscow over the war in Ukraine.</description>

Especially when you hear stories about people who are described as self-proclaimed fill in the blank.
So either a Healer, a fortune teller, a again fill in the blank, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say you can enter with a little bit of caution.

She never got to conclude her argument — first New York changed the law, then came Roe v. Wade. Now, with Roe overturned, she describes how it feels to watch the right to terminate a pregnancy fall away.</description>

Livewired is a work of 10 years on a topic
that is fascinating to me, which is neuroplasticity

First, that&amp;rsquo;s what most people call it anyway.
Second, I&amp;rsquo;ve already been interviewing physicists, historians, philosophers, mathematicians,
writers, athletes.
Switching away from AI in the name gives me the freedom to do that a little bit more.

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language and mentions sexual assault.
The Supreme Court decision on Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade sent abortion clinics into a tailspin.
That day Rosenda, a receptionist at a family planning clinic in Arizona, spent eight hours on the phone telling women the clinic could no longer help them.
“I wanted to hug her, I wanted to help her but I know I can’t,” she said of one patient she called.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Michael Kimmelman, the architecture critic of The New York Times, traveled to Houston to observe an approach to chronic homelessness that has won widespread praise.
Houston, the nation’s fourth-most populous city, has moved more than 25,000 homeless people directly into apartments and houses in the past decade, an overwhelming majority of whom remain housed after two years.
This has been achieved through a “housing first” practice: moving the most vulnerable from the streets directly into apartments, instead of shelters, without individuals being required to do a 12-step program, or to find a job.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that eliminates women’s constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote on behalf of the majority, while President Biden has denounced the court’s action as the “realization of extreme ideology.” In this special episode, we explore how the court arrived at this landmark decision — and how it will transform American life.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
After a nearly yearlong investigation, the congressional committee examining the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol will begin holding televised hearings on Thursday.
One focus of the hearings will be the Proud Boys. The trajectory of that group, which grew out of a drinking club in New York City for men who felt put upon by liberal culture, has now led to charges of trying to overthrow the United States government.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Alexander Friedman.
He&amp;rsquo;s a professor at Drexel University and the director of the Nijheim Plasma Institute.
He&amp;rsquo;s one of the top plasma physicists and plasma chemists in the world.
And most importantly to me, he&amp;rsquo;s my dad.
Plasma, by the way, is not referring to blood plasma in biology,
but to the fourth state of matter in physics, solid, liquid, gas, and plasma,
which is a gas of charged particles that behaves in fascinating ways.</description>

Hello, welcome to the armchair expert.
I&amp;rsquo;m your host.
Zach Braff today.
I&amp;rsquo;m speaking with a good friend of mine.
Ellen DeGeneres.
You&amp;rsquo;ve probably never heard of her.
She&amp;rsquo;s mostly unknown.
I mean, she does have a daytime show.
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty popular.
She&amp;rsquo;s had many sitcoms.
In fact, she is such a Powerhouse.
0:16
I think she even has a game show.
That&amp;rsquo;s very popular.
So it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get a few minutes with this woman and she was gracious enough to give us some of her time.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After a series of deadly mass shootings in the United States, the National Rifle Association and some Republican leaders and conservatives are pointing to mental illness.
This approach raises a question: How can the mental health system stop gun violence when mental illness is so rarely the cause of it?
We revisit a conversation from 2018 with a psychiatrist who is wrestling with that challenge.
Guest: Dr. Amy Barnhorst, the vice chairwoman of community psychiatry at the University of California, Davis.</description>

Carl&amp;rsquo;s mix of humor, brilliance, and kindness,
to me, are inspiring and captivating.
This was a huge honor and a pleasure.

        <description>Podcast Description In calling for Republicans to pass gun safety measures like expanded background checks, Democrats point to polls that show most Americans support the idea. They aren’t wrong about the polling. In fact, some polls show that over 90 percent of Americans support expanded checks. Polling, however, does not tell the whole story.</description>

interested in social robotics, robot ethics, and generally how technology intersects with society.
She explores the emotional connection between human beings and lifelike machines,
which for me is one of the most exciting topics in all of artificial intelligence.
As she writes in her bio, she is a caretaker of several domestic robots,

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language and details of a sexual assault accusation.
Since a jury ruled in favor of Johnny Depp in his defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard, there has been impassioned debate about what exactly the outcome means for the #MeToo movement.
It raises the question: If people being accused of sexual assault can potentially win defamation cases in court, what does that mean for the accused — and the accusers — moving forward?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Pennsylvania, a candidate falsely claiming election fraud in 2020 prevailed in a crowded Republican primary for governor. But in Georgia, two incumbents — the governor and the secretary of state — beat back challenges from “stop the steal” opponents.
Is re-litigating the 2020 election a vote winner for Republicans? Or is it increasingly becoming a losing issue?

        <description>Podcast Description Three months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the biggest surprises has been the inability of the Russian military to achieve some of its basic goals. One clear example: A failed attempt to cross the Donets river in eastern Ukraine earlier this month left hundreds of Russian soldiers dead. Its aftermath is raising doubts in Russia, even among the military’s most ardent supporters.

        <description>Podcast Description Chronic pain is one of the leading causes of long-term disability in the world. By some measures, 50 million Americans live with chronic pain, in part because the power of medicine to relieve it remains inadequate.
Helen Ouyang, a physician and contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, explores the potentially groundbreaking use of virtual reality in the alleviation of acute pain, as well as anxiety and depression, and meets the doctors and entrepreneurs who believe this “nonpharmacological therapy” is a good alternative to prescription drugs.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Anca Drogon,
a professor at Berkeley working on human robot interaction,
algorithms that look beyond the robot&amp;rsquo;s function
in isolation and generate robot behavior
that accounts for interaction
and coordination with human beings.
She also consults at Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company,
but in this conversation,
she is 100% wearing her Berkeley hat.
She is one of the most brilliant and fun roboticists
in the world to talk with.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Over the weekend, an 18-year-old man livestreamed himself shooting 13 people and killing 10. Within hours it became clear that the shooter’s intent was to kill as many Black people as possible. The suspect wrote online that he was motivated by replacement theory — a racist idea that white people are deliberately being replaced by people of color in places like America and Europe.
What are the origins of this theory, and how has it become simultaneously more extreme and more mainstream?</description>

Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology

He&amp;rsquo;s perhaps best known for his work
on associative neural networks,
now known as Hopfield networks,
that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed
the development of the modern field of deep learning.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains descriptions of suicide.
Over the past five years, a series of investigations by The Times has revealed the terror and tragedy that America’s air wars, despite being promoted as the most precise in history, have brought to civilians on the ground.
The program has also exacted a heavy toll on the military personnel guiding the drones to their targets. They include soldiers such as Capt. Kevin Larson, a decorated pilot, who died by suicide after a drug arrest and court-martial.</description>

He&amp;rsquo;s a philosopher and cognitive scientist
specializing in the areas of philosophy of mind,
philosophy of language, and consciousness.
He&amp;rsquo;s perhaps best known for formulating
the hard problem of consciousness,
which could be stated as why does the feeling
which accompanies awareness of sensory information
exist at all?
Consciousness is almost entirely a mystery.

        <description>Podcast Description It was meant to mark the start of their lives out of college, but the adventure quickly turned into a nightmare. Beginning with what seemed to be a lucky whale sighting, three friends set out on a sea-kayaking trip through Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska, watching out for bears, and having a good time, when tragedy struck.
In recounting the days preceding and following the accident, which seriously injured one of his friends, the Times journalist Jon Mooallem explains how he was forced to reckon with his fears.</description>

Almost 50 years ago, when the Supreme Court first ruled that women had the constitutional right to an abortion, it was met with little controversy.
In Part 2, we asked: How, then, did abortion become one of the most controversial issues of our time?</description>

professor at CUNY, and columnist at the New York Times. His academic work centers around
international economics, economic geography, liquidity traps, and currency crises. But he

Some states will ban abortion, and some will continue to allow it. And then there is a third group: swing states, where a final decision will be up for grabs.

It feels more obvious with spiritualism where we see adaptations of ideas spread across a lot of different religions, but it happens with the occult as well.
Everything is connected is what you&amp;rsquo;re telling me.
So what we get is maybe a true origin story that then gets tainted by centuries of conspiracy theories and appropriation.

        <description>Podcast Description The United States is seeing a revival in union membership.
In the last six months, the National Labor Relations Board has recorded a 60 percent increase in workers filing for petitions that allow for union elections to take place.
The circumstances that have prompted these unionization efforts have some similarities with the period that brought the largest gain in union membership in U.S. history, during the 1930s.
What can that era tell us about today, and are current efforts just a blip?</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210486/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In January 2021, one of President Biden’s first big moves in office was to sign an executive order mandating masks in airports and on planes and other forms of public transit.
But an unexpected ruling from a judge in Florida has abruptly and unexpectedly overturned that mandate — and the implications of the decision could tie the government’s hands when it comes to future health emergencies.
Guest: Sheryl Gay Stolberg, a Washington correspondent covering health policy for The New York Times; and Heather Murphy, a reporter covering travel for The Times.</description>

Seances are one of those areas of spiritualism that can be polarizing, but spiritualism is also personal and seances can be very personal.
I cannot wait to hear about this topic.
I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what else to say except tell me more.
Well, I think today&amp;rsquo;s topic is super interesting because we have seances taking place in the white house.

        <description>Podcast Description A Times investigation last year found that minor traffic stops in the United States were far more deadly than widely thought — in the previous five years, 400 unarmed motorists who were not under pursuit for any violent crime were killed by the police during such checks.
We look at the different efforts across the country to rethink the stops and at the pushback from opponents who say that restrictions on the practice could keep more guns and criminals on the streets.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description America is home to 735 billionaires with a collective worth greater than $4.7 trillion, according to Forbes. There were just 424 billionaires in 2012, Forbes found, and only 243 a decade before that. The billionaires keep multiplying.
In this article, Willy Staley uses information from the first billionaire count — commissioned in 1981 by the entrepreneur Malcolm Forbes for his own magazine — to consider the reasons behind the rapid increase in American billionaires, but also the changing attitudes on publicizing the details of one’s wealth.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When they go to the polls on Sunday, voters in France will be faced with the same two presidential candidates as 2017: Emmanuel Macron, the president and a polished centrist, and Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally party.
Yet the context is different. There is a war in Europe, and the contest is tight.
What are the stakes in the runoff election, and how has the race become so close?</description>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210490/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description In Texas, a heated political battle is taking place over care provided to young transgender people, with Gov. Greg Abbott taking a leading role.
The story of this confrontation began, improbably, with the contentious divorce of a suburban couple from Dallas, and a nasty custody battle over their daughter.
We look at how a domestic dispute precipitated one of the fiercest political clashes in the country, and return to yesterday’s story about a trans teenager, Grayson, and his mother to explore the impact of this clash.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of younger Americans who identify as transgender and are seeking medical intervention to support their transition.
This increase has coincided with laws introduced in Republican State Houses across the country that seek to block trans youth from accessing gender-affirming care. Nowhere is the political battle more polarized and heated than in Texas.
In the first of two episodes on the situation in Texas, we explore the story of one family seeking such care for their son when the political storm hit.</description>

For those of you that have heard of Lilith Fair, the all-female Music Fest.
I&amp;rsquo;m curious, how many actually, no, its namesake.
Do you know who Lilith is or who she was?
I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the name.
I don&amp;rsquo;t, I know it&amp;rsquo;s something potentially demonic but then again, so are you so high?

        <description>Podcast Description Across the United States, 45 million borrowers now owe $1.6 trillion in debt for federal loans taken out for college — more than consumers owe on any other debt except mortgages.
For the past two years, beginning as the pandemic spread, the U.S. government has allowed tens of millions of Americans to stop paying back their students loans.
This experiment in debt deferral has had unintended consequences, and poses a dilemma for President Biden.</description>

        <description>The following is a conversation with Bjarne Stroustrup.
He is the creator of C++, a programming language that, after 40 years, is still one of the most
popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many
of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you&amp;rsquo;re watching
this on YouTube, for example, many of the critical back end components of YouTube are written in C++.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Indigenous Brazilian territory of Ituna-Itatá was established in 2011 for the protection of an isolated group that has never been contacted by outsiders or fully confirmed to exist. But despite its special status, it has become one of the most invaded Indigenous territories in Brazil since the election of the pro-development, anti-regulatory president, Jair Bolsonaro, in 2018 — becoming something of a poster board for the Amazon’s eventual demise.</description>

From 1986 until his retirement in 2005,
he dominated the chess world,
ranking world number one for most of those 19 years.
While he has many historical matches
against human chess players,
in the long arc of history he may be remembered
for his match against the machine, IBM&amp;rsquo;s Deep Blue.</description>

At first, the involvement of Mr. Musk, the C.E.O. of Tesla, was seen by the social media giant as a chance to gain a powerful ally. Instead, Twitter’s fate has suddenly become much harder to predict.

Since the start of the war in Ukraine, however, Mr. Biden has largely stopped making the case for these plans, instead turning his focus to pumping as much oil and gas as possible.

I would say almost every Supernatural monster has a real life origin story and that includes werewolves.
Now.
I&amp;rsquo;m not saying they&amp;rsquo;re real but they do have a very real past.
They were real to me as a little kid, at least one actor did Lon Chaney jr.
He was a werewolf and like the some of the older movies.

        <description>Podcast Description For more than two decades, Belarus existed in an equilibrium of quiet authoritarianism. If the government’s repressions didn’t directly touch them, most Belarusians tolerated them. But over the course of 2020, the country’s history and identity, which never much interested a majority of people who lived there, became something they would sacrifice their lives for.
Sarah A. Topol explores the battle over a political mural in a public park in Minsk and considers the future of Belarus.</description>

        <title>How Germany’s Approach to Russia Backfired | The Daily</title>

        <guid>https://swiest.com/en/1196210501/</guid>
        <description>Podcast Description Thirty years ago, Germany put forth a theory for how to work with Russia. Major energy deals, leaders argued, would keep Russia from going to war with its neighbors.
Over the past 20 years, Germany has made itself incredibly dependent on Russian gas.
The war in Ukraine has complicated that relationship and has shown how Germany’s approach to Russia has not only failed, but also backfired.

        <description>Podcast Description As countries have struggled with disease and death throughout the coronavirus pandemic, one part of the world seems to have been mostly spared: central and western Africa.
South Africa was deeply affected by waves of the coronavirus, as were countries in East Africa like Kenya and Uganda. But nations in the center and west of the continent appear to have been largely spared.
What is behind these low case and death rates — and what does that tell us about the future of the pandemic?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode details graphic scenes.
Many around the world are calling the indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Bucha, a suburb northwest of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a war crime.
But investigating such atrocities is painstakingly complicated. Could one case that resulted in convictions — the genocide in Bosnia in the 1990s — offer lessons on how to proceed?

        <description>Podcast Description Ukraine and Russia are enormous producers of wheat, corn, barley, sunflower oil and fertilizer. One study calculated that the two countries accounted for 12 percent of the world’s calories.

        <description>Podcast Description Russians and Ukrainians are deeply connected. Millions of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia. Many have lived in the country.
But Moscow has taken steps to shield its people from open information about the war, even as its bombing campaign intensifies.
When Ukrainians try to explain the dire situation to family members in Russia, they are often met with denial, resistance, and a kind of refusal to believe.

        <description>Podcast Description There’s a working theory for the origins of Covid-19. It goes like this: Somewhere in an open-air market in Wuhan, China, a new coronavirus, growing inside an animal, first made the jump to a human. But what happens when diseases spread in the other direction?
Sonia Shah, a science journalist, explores the dangers of “spillback,” or “reverse zoonosis”: when humans infect non-humans with disease. Using the history of diseases spreading through mink farms in the United States and Europe as a focus, Shah considers the implications of spillback, and how we might minimize its future impact.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Inflation in the United States has been getting worse. In December, prices were up 7 percent from the previous year — the fastest rise in 40 years.
Americans feel terrible about the economy, imperiling the Democratic Party’s chances of holding on to power in Washington in this year’s midterm elections.
While disruption caused by the pandemic is a key cause of higher prices — a situation that predates the Biden administration — a question remains: How much have the Democrats’ own policies contributed to the problem?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description During the pandemic, the price of beef shot up. Wholesale beef prices increased more than 40 percent — more than 70 percent for certain cuts of steak.
The conventional wisdom was that price increases simply reflected the chaos that the coronavirus had caused in the supply chain. But there’s evidence that they were in fact a reflection of a more fundamental change in the meatpacking business.
We speak to ranchers about the consolidation of the industry and explore what it can show us about a transformation in the American economy — one much bigger than beef.</description>

The contagiousness of the Omicron variant has many people resigned to the fact that they probably will be infected; this variant is, relative to its predecessors and in most cases, milder; and there is universal vaccine access for those old enough to receive a shot.
So, The Times commissioned a poll of 4,400 Americans to discover how they are thinking about the pandemic and gauge how, and when, we might pivot to living with the virus.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Novak Djokovic, the world No. 1 player in men’s tennis, had a lot at stake going into this year’s Australian Open. A win there would have made him the most decorated male tennis player in history.
But he arrived in the country without having had a Covid-19 vaccination, flying in the face of Australia’s rules, and after a court battle he was ultimately deported.
In Australia, the “Djokovic affair” has become about a lot more than athletes and vaccines — it has prompted conversations about the country’s aggressive border policy, isolationism and treatment of migrants.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description It’s a big week in the Senate for voting rights. Democrats have two bills that include measures to bolster and protect elections.

        <description>Podcast Description Elizabeth Weil, the author of today’s Sunday Read, writes that, in her marriage, there was a silent third spouse: California.
“The state was dramatic and a handful,” Weil writes. “But she was gorgeous, and she brought into our lives, through the natural world, all the treasure and magic we’d need.”
However, for Weil, there is internal conflict living in a state where wildfires have become the norm. She describes living through a discontinuity in which previously held logic fails to stand up to reality.</description>

For Wesley Morris, a Times culture critic, it is Mr. Poitier — not John Wayne, Cary Grant or Marilyn Monroe — who is the greatest American movie star.
“His legacy is so much wider and deeper than the art itself,” Wesley said.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has a reputation for causing mild illness, yet it’s fueling a staggering rise in hospitalizations across the country.
In some of the early hot spots for the variant, emergency rooms are filling up, hospitals are being flooded with new patients and there aren’t enough staff to care for all of them.
We explore why the Omicron surge is leading to hospitalizations and hear from doctors about what they are seeing, and why this surge feels different from the ones that came before.</description>

Hard to define, these grievances have been granted a new name: ambiguous loss. The death of a loved one, missing relatives, giving a child up for adoption, a lost friend — Boss teases out how one can mourn something that cannot always be described.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After the election on Nov. 3, 2020, President J. Donald Trump and his allies tested the limits of the U.S. election system, launching pressure and legal campaigns in competitive states to have votes overturned — all the while exposing the system’s precariousness.
Although the efforts weren’t successful, they appear to have been only the beginning of a wider attack on American elections. In the final part of our Jan.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming was the only Republican leader calling on President Donald Trump to move on from his efforts to overturn the results. Then, after the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, she gave a full-throated condemnation of what had happened and the rhetoric that facilitated it.
A year later, while many of her party have backed down from criticizing the former president, she has remained steadfast — a conviction that’s cost her leadership position.</description>

Members of far-right extremist groups were present but so too were also doctors, lawyers, substitute teachers and church deacons, many of whom had previously been nonpolitical.
The question of why they were at the Capitol that day is hard to answer, but some of the most useful clues come from three F.</description>

Many of the vaccinated felt like they didn’t need tests and demand took a nosedive. Testing sites were closed or converted into vaccination sites. And Abbott Laboratories, a major test manufacturer, wound up destroying millions.
However, with the surge of the new Omicron variant, which is less susceptible to vaccines, demand for testing is back — and it is outstripping supply.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia was always going to be the last Democrat to get on board with President Biden’s $2.2 trillion climate, social spending and tax bill. But the White House was confident that a compromise could be reached.
On Sunday, that confidence was shattered: In an interview on Fox News, Mr. Manchin essentially declared that he could not support the bill as written, and he indicated that he was done negotiating all together.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains references to suicide and abuse that may be upsetting to some listeners.
A few months ago, we told the story of N, a teenager in Afghanistan whose family was trying to force her to marry a member of the Taliban. Her identity has been concealed for her safety.

        <description>Podcast Description Nearly a decade after the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, which destroyed piers and damaged riverside social housing projects, residents of Lower Manhattan are still vulnerable to floods.
Michael Kimmelman, The Times’s architecture critic, explores the nine-year effort to redesign Lower Manhattan in the wake of the hurricane, and the design and planning challenges that have made progress incremental. He goes inside a fight over how to protect the neighborhood in the future — revealing why renewal in the face of climate disaster is so complicated.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is incredibly contagious — it is able to infect people with even greater frequency than the Delta variant, and it is skilled at evading the immune system’s defenses. Much is still unknown about the new variant, and scientists are racing to understand its threat. But amid the uncertainty, there’s good news about a prospective new virus treatment: A pill by Pfizer is effective in reducing people’s risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Anti-abortion activists across the country are optimistic that they might be on the cusp of achieving a long-held goal of the movement: overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that extended federal protections for abortion.
But many abortion rights activists are hopeful, too. They are watching closely to see whether the Food and Drug Administration will roll back restrictions on one medication, transforming abortion access across the country.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The economic situation in Afghanistan is perilous. Banks have run out of cash. In some areas, Afghans are selling their belongings in ad hoc flea markets. Parents wait around hospitals and clinics in the hopes of getting treatment for severely malnourished children.

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
The Steele Dossier — compiled by Christopher Steele, a British former spy — was born out of opposition research on Donald J. Trump, then a presidential candidate, and his supposed links to Russia.
The document, full of salacious allegations, captured and cleaved America. But now, a main source of the dossier’s findings — Igor Danchenko, a Russian analyst — has been charged with lying to federal investigators.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In Memphis, as in America, the benefits of homeownership have not accrued equally across race.
Housing policy in the United States has leaned heavily on homeownership as a driver of household wealth since the middle of the last century, and, for many white Americans, property ownership has indeed yielded significant wealth. But Black families have largely been left behind, either unable to buy in the first place or hampered by risks that come with owning property.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In November, Peng Shuai — one of China’s most popular tennis stars — took to Chinese social media to accuse Zhang Gaoli, who was a member of China’s seven-member ruling committee, of sexually assaulting her.
Within minutes, Chinese censors had taken down Ms. Peng’s post, and, for weeks, no one sees or hears from her.
We look at Ms. Peng’s story and what China’s attempts to censor her have meant for the sports industry.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains details about suicide deaths and strong language.
A few years ago, a website about suicide appeared. On it, not only do people talk about wanting to die, but they share, at great length, how they are going to do it.
Times reporters were able to identify 45 people who killed themselves after spending time on the site, several of whom were minors. The true number is likely to be higher.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Russian military is on the move toward the border with Ukraine, with American intelligence suggesting that Moscow is preparing for an offensive involving some 175,000 troops.
Could the moves herald a full-scale invasion? And if so, what is driving President Vladimir V. Putin’s brinkmanship over Russia’s southwestern neighbor?

I think my most read article ever was an essay.
I wrote on what I called work is MM.
The idea that in a time of declining, religion work for many Americans has replaced religion, like many of us used to look to God for meeting or church for Community or religious ritual for Transcendence, but now a lot of us seek out these things.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Last week, after a shooting at Oxford High School in the suburbs of Detroit that left four teenagers dead, local prosecutors decided on a novel legal strategy that would extend criminal culpability beyond the 15-year-old accused of carrying out the attack. But could that strategy become a national model?

When Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail, dozens of his alleged victims lost their chance to bring him to justice.
But the trial of his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, on charges that she recruited, groomed and ultimately helped Mr. Epstein abuse young girls, may offer an opportunity to obtain a degree of reckoning.

        <description>Podcast Description In her book, “My Body,” Emily Ratajkowski reflects on her fraught relationship with the huge number of photographs of her body that have come to define her life and career.
Some essays recount the author’s hustle as a young model who often found herself in troubling situations with powerful men; another is written as a long, venomous reply to an email from a photographer who has bragged of discovering her.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Stephen Sondheim died last week at his home in Roxbury, Conn. He was 91.
For six decades, Mr. Sondheim, a composer-lyricist whose works include “Sweeney Todd” and “Into the Woods,” transformed musical theater into an art form as rich, complex and contradictory as life itself.
“For me, the loss that we see pouring out of Twitter right now and everywhere you look as people write about their memories of Sondheim is for that person who says yes, devoting yourself to writing or to dancing or to singing or to composing — or whatever it is — is a worthwhile life,” Jesse Green, The Times’s chief theater critic, said in today’s episode.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard a case that was a frontal challenge to Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50-year-old decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
The case in front of the justices was about a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
For the state to win, the court, which now has a conservative majority, would have to do real damage to the central tenet of the Roe ruling.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Amazon is constantly hiring. Data has shown that the company has had a turnover rate of about 150 percent a year.
For the founder, Jeff Bezos, worker retention was not important, and the company built systems that didn’t require skilled workers or extensive training — it could hire and lose people all of the time.
Amazon has been able to replenish its work force, but the pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of this approach.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The story of the Omicron variant began a week ago, when researchers in southern Africa detected a version of the coronavirus that carried 50 mutations.
When scientists look at coronavirus mutations, they worry about three things: Is the new variant more contagious? Is it going to cause people to get sicker? And how will the vaccines work against it?
We explore when we will get the answers to these three questions, and look at the discovery of the variant and the international response to it.</description>

Heading into deliberations in the trial of the three white men in Georgia accused of chasing down and killing Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man, it was not clear which way the jurors were leaning.
In the end, the mostly white jury found all three men guilty of murder. We look at the prosecution’s decision not to make race a central tenet of their case, and how the verdict was reached.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After a landslide re-election in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s control over India seemed impossible to challenge.
But a yearlong farmers’ protest against agricultural overhauls has done just that, forcing the Indian prime minister to back down.
How did the protesters succeed?

        <description>Podcast Description In the 1950s and ’60s, the Tremé neighborhood of New Orleans, one of the oldest African-American neighborhoods in the United States, was a vibrant community.
But the construction of the Claiborne Expressway in the 1960s gutted the area.
The Biden administration has said that the trillion-dollar infrastructure package will address such historical wrongs.
How might that be achieved?

        <description>Podcast Description As the novel coronavirus spread and much of the world moved toward isolation, dream researchers began rushing to design studies and set up surveys that might allow them to access some of the most isolated places of all, the dreamscapes unfolding inside individual brains. The first thing almost everyone noticed was that for many people, their dream worlds seemed suddenly larger and more intense.
One study of more than 1,000 Italians living through strict lockdown found that some 60 percent were sleeping badly — before the pandemic, only a third of Italians reported trouble sleeping — and they were also remembering more of their dreams than during normal times and reporting that those dreams felt unusually real and emotional and bizarre.</description>

There are like 1,000 things going on in the US economy, the unemployment rates doing this, and the stock, market&amp;rsquo;s doing that and Retail inflation or over here, doing their own thing.
It is a big messy, complicated story, but somehow when that big messy, complicated story is filtered through the media message making machine.

But pressure has mounted on him in the past year and a half. After a contested election in 2020, the European Union enacted sanctions and refused to recognize his leadership.
In the hopes of bringing the bloc to the negotiating table, Mr. Lukashenko has engineered a migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border, where thousands from the Middle East, Africa and Asia have converged.</description>

A new battleground has emerged in American politics: school boards. In these meetings, parents increasingly engage in heated — sometimes violent — fights over hot-button issues such as mask mandates and critical race theory.
Suddenly, the question of who sits on a school board has become a question about which version of America will prevail.

Assessing the damage, the workers found that there had been around 70 casualties, and a lawyer decided that it was a potential war crime.
We look at how the system that was designed to bring the airstrike to light, ended up keeping it hidden.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Democrats first set out to expand the social safety net, they envisioned a piece of legislation as transformational as what the party has achieved in the 1960s.

        <description>Podcast Description The recent U.S.-British deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines might look relatively inconsequential. But it signifies a close alliance between the three countries to face off against China.
It is also notable for another reason: It has greatly angered the French. Why?

        <description>Podcast Description You have almost certainly heard Nicholas Britell’s music, even if you don’t know his name. More than any other contemporary composer, he appears to have the whole of music history at his command, shifting easily between vocabularies, often in the same film.
His most arresting scores tend to fuse both ends of his musical education. “Succession” is 18th-century court music married to heart-pounding beats; “Moonlight” chops and screws a classical piano-and-violin duet as if it’s a Three 6 Mafia track.</description>

“Six,” a revisionist feminist British pop musical about the wives of King Henry VIII, was shaping up to be a substantial hit on Broadway after finding success in London.
On its opening night, however, in March 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a shutdown of theater that would wind up lasting a year and a half.
We speak to the cast and crew of “Six” about the show’s path back to the stage and explore what it tells us about the trials of Broadway during the pandemic.</description>

But her company collapsed, and she was accused of lying about how well Theranos’s technology worked. Now she is on trial on fraud charges.
The case against Ms. Holmes is being held up as a referendum on the “fake it till you make it” culture of Silicon Valley, but it’s also about so much more.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In a major turn of events in Mexico, which has one of the largest Catholic populations in the world, its Supreme Court last week decriminalized abortions.
The Supreme Court ruling is a milestone for Mexico’s feminist movement. But change might not come quickly: Abortion law is mostly administered at the state level in Mexico, much of the country remains culturally conservative, and many Mexican medical workers are morally opposed to abortion.</description>

An alarming rise in schizophrenia diagnoses suggests some homes have found a way to skirt the rules.

It’s a way of thinking that can be traced back to the first real internet blockbuster, a 9/11 conspiracy documentary called “Loose Change.” Today, we explore the film’s impact.</description>

Terry Albury joined the F.B.I. just before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, drawn in by the bureau’s work fighting child exploitation. His role quickly changed after 9/11 however, and he subsequently spent over a decade working in counterterrorism.
Around 2015, he began to deeply question his work. “This is not what I joined the F.B.I. to do,” he recalled thinking. His doubts about the bureau’s workings led him to leak classified information to journalists.</description>

The memory of the Taliban of the 1990s — the public executions, the whippings in the streets and the harsh rules preventing women from leaving the house unaccompanied — has filled some with fear. This time around, what will their rule mean for ordinary Afghans?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In a way, the new Texas law that has effectively banned abortions after six weeks is typical — many other Republican-led states have sought to ban abortions after six, 10 or 15 weeks.
But where federal courts have routinely struck down other anti-abortion laws, the Texas legislation has gone into effect with the Supreme Court’s blessing.
How has this law survived so far, and where does it leave abortion providers in the state?</description>

There are, however, big differences between the two disasters — namely that the city, in the 16 years since Katrina, has heavily invested in flood defenses. But on the ground, there is little cause for celebration.

        <description>Podcast Description On Monday night, after a 20-year war that claimed 170,000 lives, cost over $2 trillion and did not defeat the Taliban, the United States completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan.
As the last of the American forces left under the cover of darkness, there was celebratory gunfire from the Taliban. The moment of exit, a day earlier than expected, was both historic and anticlimactic.
We explore what happened in the last few hours and days of the American occupation, and look at what it leaves behind.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The last few days in Afghanistan have been chaotic as the Taliban retake control of the country.
The debacle can be traced to a number of assumptions that guided the U.S. decision to withdraw from the country this year after two decades of war.

On Sunday, the president of Afghanistan fled the country; the Taliban seized control of Kabul, the capital; and the American-backed government collapsed.

Mr. Briley first reached out to Ms. Bazelon after hearing her on the radio talking about “Charges,” her book on how prosecutors have historically used their power to increase incarceration.

In short, the climate crisis has arrived, and it’s going to get worse before it can get better.
In this episode, we explore the main takeaways from the report — including what needs to happen in the narrowing window of climate opportunity to avoid the most devastating outcomes.</description>

In the early 20th century, Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was an epicenter of Black economic influence in the United States. However, in the early hours of June 1, 1921, a white mob — sanctioned by the Tulsa police — swept through the community burning and looting homes and businesses, and killing residents.
A century later, the question before Congress, the courts and the United States as a whole is: What would justice look like?</description>

William King, a British geologist, suspected that this was not merely the remains of an atypical human, but belonged to a typical member of an alternate humanity. He named the species Homo neanderthalensis: Neanderthal man.

For Facebook, however, this feature is anything but innocuous — it strikes at the heart of the company’s business model.
The dispute represents a further deterioration in the frosty relations between the two companies. What’s at the heart of this conflict, and why have the stakes become so high for both sides?</description>

He believes that classics is so entangled with white supremacy as to be inseparable from it.

His multitrillion-dollar plan aims not only to repair roads and bridges, but also to bolster the nation’s competitiveness in things like 5G, semiconductors and human infrastructure.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Republican-led legislatures are racing to restrict voting rights, in a broad political effort that first began in the state of Georgia.

A number of animal species possess beautifully conspicuous and physically burdensome features.
Many biologists have long fit these tasking aesthetic displays into a more utilitarian view of evolution. However, a new generation of biologists have revived a long-ignored theory — that aesthetics and survival do not necessarily need to be linked and that animals can appreciate beauty for its own sake.</description>

On today’s Sunday Read, the story of the Cloud Appreciation Society and how Mr. Pretor-Pinney, backed with good will, challenged the cloud authorities.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Within hours of assuming the presidency, President Biden signed a flurry of executive orders. He rejoined the Paris climate agreement, repealed the so-called Muslim travel ban and mandated the wearing of masks on federal property. The actions had a theme: They either reversed former President Donald Trump’s actions or rebuked his general policy approach. But governing by decree has a downside. We look at the potential positives of the orders and point out the pitfalls.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Unity was the byword of President Biden’s Inaugural Address.
The speech was an attempt to turn the page. But can this be achieved without, as many in the Democratic coalition believe, a full reckoning with and accountability of how America got to this point of division?
Today, we explore the defining messages of the president’s inaugural address.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Polling in the days since the storming of the Capitol paints a complex picture. While most Americans do not support the riot, a majority of Republicans do not believe that President Trump bears responsibility. And over 70 percent of them say they believe that there was widespread fraud in the election.
Before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, we called Trump supporters to hear their views about what happened at the Capitol and to gauge the level of dissatisfaction the new president will inherit.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Most Americans treat climate change seriously but not literally — they accept the science, worry about forecasts but tell themselves that someone else will get serious about fixing the problem very soon.
The Valve Turners, on the other hand, take climate change both very seriously and very literally.
In the fall of 2016, the group of five environmental activists — all in their 50s and 60s, most with children and one with grandchildren — closed off five cross-border crude oil pipelines, including the Keystone.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language. Three days after being sworn into Congress, Representative Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan, was sitting in the gallery of the House of Representatives as pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol. After the siege, Mr. Meijer made his feelings clear: President Trump’s actions proved that he was “rankly unfit.” A week later, he became one of just a handful of Republicans to vote for impeachment.

While most House Republicans lined up against the move, this impeachment, unlike the last, saw a handful vote in favor. Today, we walk through the events of Wednesday, and the shifting arguments that led up to the history-making second impeachment.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description After the attack on the Capitol, social media platforms sprang into action, deleting the accounts of agitators. Without a central place to congregate, groups have splintered off into other, darker corners of the internet. That could complicate the efforts of law enforcement to track their plans.
We ask whether the crackdown on social media has reduced the risk of violence — or just made it harder to prevent.</description>

We look at the efforts to punish the president for the attack on the Capitol and explain what the impeachment process might look like.

        <description>Podcast Description As 2020 drew to a close, a concerning development in the pandemic came out of Britain — a new variant of the coronavirus had been discovered that is significantly more transmissible. It has since been discovered in a number of countries, including the United States.
The emergence of the new variant has added a new level of urgency to the rollout of vaccines in the U.S., a process that has been slow so far.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Without many predators or any prey, rhinos flourished for millions of years. Humans put an end to that, as we hunted them down and destroyed their habitat.
No rhino, however, is doing worse than the northern white. Just two, Najin and Fatu, both females, remain.
In his narrated story, Sam Anderson, a staff writer at The Times Magazine, visits the pair at the Ol Pejeta conservancy in Kenya, speaks to the men who devote their days to caring for them and explores what we will lose when Najin and Fatu die.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language. The pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol on Wednesday made their plans in plain sight. They organized on social media platforms and spoke openly of their intentions to occupy the Capitol.
But leaders in Washington opted for a modest law enforcement presence. In the aftermath, those security preparations are attracting intense scrutiny.

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains strong language.
It was always going to be a tense day in Washington. In the baseless campaign to challenge Joe Biden’s victory, Wednesday had been framed by President Trump and his allies as the moment for a final stand.
But what unfolded was disturbing: A mob, urged on by the president, advanced on the Capitol building as Congress was certifying the election results and eventually breached its walls.</description>

Scott Watson — a Black police officer in his hometown, Flint, Mich. — has worked to become a pillar of the community. And he always believed his identity put him in a unique position to discharge his duties.

If they did, Caity argues, Cher would be on course to win a second Oscar for her performance as Loretta Castorini in 1987’s “Moonstruck” — a film that, under lockdown, was a salve to many.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday, clearing the way for millions of highly vulnerable people to begin receiving the vaccine within days.
The authorization is a historic turning point in a pandemic that has taken more than 290,000 lives in the United States. With the decision, the United States becomes the sixth country — in addition to Britain, Bahrain, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico — to clear the vaccine.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In three weeks, an election will take place that could be as important as the presidential vote in determining the course of the next four years.
The Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia will determine whether two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, keep their seats. If their Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, both win, Democrats would claim control of the Senate, giving President-Elect Joe Biden expanded power to realize his policy agenda.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description From the start of the pandemic, the Trump administration said it was committed to ordering and stockpiling enough potential vaccine doses to end the outbreak in the United States as quickly as possible.
But new reporting from The Times has revealed that Pfizer, the maker of the first vaccine to show effectiveness against the coronavirus, tried unsuccessfully to get the government to lock in 100 million extra doses.</description>

Amid the optimism that normal life might soon resume, there is also concern. Has the vaccine been developed too fast? Is it safe? On today’s episode, we examine how Britons feel about the prospect of receiving a shot and attend a vaccination clinic in Wales.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Caitlin Dickerson, an immigration reporter for The Times, says there is one word that sums up the Trump administration’s approach to border crossing: deterrence. For nearly four years, the U.S. government has tried to discourage migrants, with reinforced walls, family separation policies and threats of deportation.
Those policies have led to the appearance of a makeshift asylum-seeker camp of frayed tents and filthy conditions within walking distance of the United States.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The state of the 2020 U.S. election is, still, not a settled matter in Georgia. For weeks, conservatives have been filing lawsuits in state and federal courts in an effort to decertify results that gave a victory to Joe Biden. On Twitter, President Trump has been making unsubstantiated claims that the state has been “scammed.”
With Georgia in political turmoil, threats of violence have been made against state election officials, who have been scrambling to recount votes by hand, and against their families.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Foresters once regarded trees as solitary individuals: They competed for space and resources, but were otherwise indifferent to one another.
The work of the Canadian ecologist Suzanne Simard upended that, finding that while there is indeed conflict in a forest, there is also negotiation, reciprocity and even selflessness.
Ms. Simard discovered that underground fungal threads link nearly every tree in a forest.
On today’s Sunday Read, listen to an exploration of these links and the influential and contentious work of Ms.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The power to pardon criminals or commute their sentences is one of the most sacred and absolute a president has, and President Trump has already used it to rescue political allies and answer the pleas of celebrities.
With his term coming to an end, the president has discussed granting three of his children, his son-in-law and personal lawyer pre-emptive pardons — a rarity in American history. We look ahead to a potential wave of pardons and commutations — and explore who could benefit.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description This episode contains descriptions of sexual assault.
When the Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy this year, it created a final window for claims of sexual abuse against the organization’s leaders.
Within nine months, nearly 100,000 victims filed suits — that far eclipses the number of sexual-abuse allegations that the Roman Catholic Church faced in the early 2000s.
Today, we hear from one of the victims, Dave Henson, a 40-year-old naval officer who was sexually abused for five years by one of his scout troop’s leaders.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description What kind of foreign policy is possible for the United States after four years of isolationism under President Trump?
Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for secretary of state, has an interventionist streak, but some vestiges of Trump-era foreign policy will be hard to upend.
If confirmed, Mr. Blinken faces the challenge of making the case at home that taking a fuller role abroad is important, while persuading international allies that the United States can be counted on.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Janet Yellen, who is poised to become secretary of the Treasury, will immediately have her work cut out for her. The U.S. economy is in a precarious state and Congress is consumed by partisan politics.
Ms. Yellen, however, is no stranger to crisis. She has already held the government’s other top economic jobs — including chairwoman of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, helping the country through the last major financial emergency.</description>

According to Dr. Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to accelerate vaccine development, the first Americans could receive the vaccine in mid-December.
With the vaccine within reach, we turn to more logistical questions: Who will receive the shots first? Who will distribute them? And what could go wrong?</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Pressure and litigation appear to have been the pillars of President Trump’s response to his general election loss.
His team filed a litany of court cases in battleground states. In some, such as Georgia and Michigan, the president and his allies took an even more bullish approach, attempting to use their influence to bear down on election officials.
As preparations for the transfer of power finally get underway, we take a look at how the Trump campaign’s attempts to overturn the election played out.</description>

The shutdown was triggered when 3 percent of coronavirus tests in the city came back positive over seven days. There are questions, however, around this number being used as a trigger — some health officials maintain that schools are safe.
When is the right time for schools to reopen and what is the right threshold for closures?</description>

Wil describes his relative’s violence as “ambient” and “endemic,” but he was sure it wouldn’t turn on him. Until a few years ago, when his cousin tried to kill him.
“My attraction to my cousin and my detachment as a husband both reside in the pantheon of male tropes,” he wrote.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description As it became clear that Europe was heading into another deadly wave of the coronavirus, most of the continent returned to lockdown. European leaders pushed largely similar messages, asking citizens to take measures to protect one another again, and governments offered broad financial support.
Weeks later, the effort seems to be working and infection rates are slowing.
In several parts of the United States, it’s a different story. In the Midwest, which is experiencing an explosion of cases similar to that seen earlier in Europe, leaders have not yet managed to come up with a coherent approach to loosen the virus’s grip.</description>

But after the election of Joe Biden, the party’s disappointing showing in congressional races — losing seats in the House and facing a struggle for even narrow control of the Senate — has exposed the rifts between progressives and moderates.
In interviews with The New York Times, House members on each side of that divide — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania — shared their views about how the Democrats can win back support in local races.</description>

The sound of victory was loud. It was banging pots, honking horns and popping corks as supporters of President-elect Joe Biden celebrated his win.
But loss, too, has a sound. In the days after the U.S. election result was announced, some of the 71 million-plus Americans who backed President Trump are grieving. Can the country overcome its differences? In discussions with voters in areas both red and blue, we traced the fault lines of the country’s deep rifts.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On the afternoon of Sept. 15, 1942, the U.S.S. Wasp, an aircraft carrier housing 71 planes, 2,247 sailors and a journalist, was hit by torpedoes fired by a Japanese submarine, sending it more than two and a half miles to the bottom of the Pacific. It has remained there ever since.
Last year, a team on the Petrel — perhaps the most successful private vessel on Earth for finding deepwater wrecks — set out to find it.</description>

Mr. Biden’s win is set to be contested — President Trump said in a statement that “the election is far from over.”

        <description>Podcast Description When President Trump took to the podium in the White House briefing room Thursday evening to give a statement on the election count, he lied about the legality of the votes against him in key battleground states and called into question the integrity of poll workers, laying a conspiracy at the feet of Democrats.
Both the Republican establishment and the conservative news media have been split in their responses to his claims.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The U.S. presidential election is a lot closer than the polls indicated. Millions of votes, many in key battleground states, are yet to be counted.
Florida — which went for President Trump — is the only bellwether to have confirmed its result. Other crucial states, including Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, are yet to be called.
For the moment, it looks like both Mr. Trump and Joe Biden will need to break through in the Midwest and Pennsylvania to clinch victory.</description>

At the heart of one race for the Wisconsin State Assembly are some of the same political cracks splitting the U.S. as a whole. Some believe keeping businesses running is a priority during the coronavirus pandemic; others think keeping people safe and healthy should be given precedence.
What do the different approaches reveal about Wisconsin politics and about broader American divisions? Reid J. Epstein, a politics reporter for The New York Times, and Andy Mills and Luke Vander Ploeg, audio producers for The Times, went to the state to find out.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description There are many permutations of the U.S. presidential election — some messier than others.
Joe Biden’s lead in national polls suggests he has a number of paths to victory. If states like Florida or Georgia break for him early on, then the Trump campaign could be in for a long night.
The task for President Trump is to close those paths. If he can hold Florida and quickly add the likes of Arizona and North Carolina, then the signs could point to re-election.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Florida’s seniors played an important role in President Trump’s victory there in 2016. Older voters, who are mostly conservative, make up around 25 percent of the swing state’s electorate and turn out in astonishing numbers.
They are also disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and polling suggests that Joe Biden is making inroads with Republican-leaning older voters.
In Florida’s conservative retirement communities, however, the decision to switch from Mr. Trump can have consequences and many stay quiet for fear of reprisals.</description>

With an election in which uncertainty may abound, concerns are swirling around the possibility of political violence. Experts and officials — including those charged with the security of polling stations and ballot counting facilities — have been taking extra precautions.
Americans across the political spectrum appear to be preparing themselves for this possibility, too: Eight of the 10 biggest weeks for gun sales since the late 1990s took place since March this year.</description>

Few can have been as ambitious or widespread as the nationwide network of 1,300 websites and newspapers run by Brian Timpone, a television reporter turned internet entrepreneur.
He has said that he sees local news as a means of preserving American civil discourse.</description>

After initially conceding, Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, contested the count.
What followed was a flurry of court cases, recounts, partisan fury and confusion. It would be months until — after a Supreme Court decision — Mr.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In America’s increasingly divided political landscape, it can be hard to imagine almost any voter switching sides. One demographic group has provided plenty of exceptions: white suburban women.
In the past four years, the group has turned away from the president in astonishing numbers. And many of them are organizing — Red, Wine and Blue is a group made up of suburban women from Ohio hoping to swing the election for Joe Biden.</description>

It was a comment on a group call, however, that gave him pause. Someone noted that his mustache made him look like a lawyer for the N.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The winner-take-all system used by the Electoral College in the United States appears nowhere in the Constitution. It awards all of a state’s electors to the candidate with the most votes, no matter how small the margin of victory. Critics say that means millions of votes are effectively ignored.
The fairness of the Electoral College was seriously questioned in the 1960s. Amid the civil rights push, changes to the system were framed as the last step of democratization.</description>

A test of those new policies came last week, when The New York Post published a story that contained supposedly incriminating documents and pictures taken from the laptop of Hunter Biden. The provenance and authenticity of that information is still in question, and Joe Biden’s campaign has rejected the assertions.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description In the struggle to control the U.S. Senate, one race in North Carolina — where the Republican incumbent, Thom Tillis, is trying to hold off his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham — could be crucial.
North Carolina is a classic purple state with a split political mind: progressive in some quarters, while firmly steeped in Southern conservative tradition in others.
Two bombshells have recently upended the race: Mr. Tillis fell ill with the coronavirus after attending an event for Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination without a mask.</description>

Throughout his nearly 40-year career, Jim was drawn to stories about discrimination, wrongly convicted prisoners and society’s mistreated outcasts. From 2007, he wrote The Times’s “About New York” column — when asked whether he had the best job in journalism, he responded, “I believe I do.”

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, evoked personal experience of life before Roe v. Wade and asked Judge Barrett whether she would vote to overturn abortion rights.
On that question, Judge Barrett demurred — an approach she would take to other contentious issues, including whether she would recuse herself if a presidential election dispute came before the court.</description>

But now, that money is running out and bipartisanship has given way to an ideological stalemate.
While Republicans balk at plans for further significant government spending — even those coming from the White House — Democrats are holding out for more money and a broader package of measures.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Most Americans say that abortion should be legal with some restrictions, but President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, signed a statement in a 2006 newspaper advertisement opposing “abortion on demand.” Her accession would bolster a conservative majority among the justices.
How did that happen? According to Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, abortion rights advocates have for too long taken Roe v. Wade for granted.</description>

Mr. Mitchko might seem like the kind of voter Joseph R. Biden Jr. wants to peel away from the Republicans in November. He had always been a Democrat — he voted for Barack Obama twice — but opted for Donald Trump in 2016.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description During most campaigns, the job of the vice-presidential candidates focuses on boosting the person heading the ticket. Proving their suitability for the top job is secondary.
But this year is different. The president is 74 and spent much of the past week in the hospital, and his Democratic rival is 77. So it was vital for their running mates, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris, to show in Wednesday night’s debate that they would be capable of stepping up if necessary.</description>

Unpretentious, cheap and relaxed, the Hatch was a successful small business until the coronavirus hit.
After the announcement in March that California would order bars and restaurants to shut down, Jack decided to follow the fortunes of the Hatch.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description On Saturday morning, the doctors treating President Trump for the coronavirus held a news conference outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center — a show of strength, aimed at reassuring the American public that he was in capable hands.
But instead of allaying concern, it raised questions, casting doubt on the timeline of the president’s illness and the seriousness of his condition.
We speak to Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker, White House correspondents for The Times, about the efforts to control the narrative, and pick through what is known about the president’s condition a month before the election.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The pandemic will mean that many more Americans vote by mail this year.
All 50 states require people to register before they can cast a mail-in vote. But from there, the rules diverge wildly.
And a lot could still change. Our correspondent Luke Broadwater, a reporter in Washington, says there are more than 300 challenges to voting-related rules winding through courts across the country.
Americans should probably brace for a different kind of election night — it could be days or longer before the full picture of results emerges.</description>

Both presidential candidates had clear goals for their first debate on Tuesday.
For Joseph R. Biden Jr., the contest was an opportunity to consolidate his lead in polls before Election Day.

His tactics for doing that emerged quickly: interrupt and destabilize.</description>

What they found was an existential threat to the image he has constructed about his wealth and lifestyle. The tax documents consistently appeared to call into question the business acumen he has cited in his presidential campaign and throughout his public life.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s pick to fill the empty seat on the Supreme Court, is a product of the conservative legal movement of the 1980s. She clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a giant of conservative jurisprudence, and his influence is evident throughout her judicial career.
Opponents of abortion, in particular, are hoping that her accession to the Supreme Court would be a crucial step forward for their movement.</description>

The councilors’ pledges to “abolish,” “dismantle” and “end policing as we know it” changed the local and national conversation about the police.
President Trump has wielded this decision and law-and-order arguments in his campaigning — Midwestern states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota may be decisive in the general election.</description>

Breonna Taylor’s mother and her supporters had made their feelings clear: Nothing short of murder charges for all three officers involved in Ms. Taylor’s death would amount to justice.
On Wednesday, one of the officers was indicted on a charge of “wanton endangerment.” No charges were brought against the two officers whose bullets actually struck Ms. Taylor.
In response, protesters have again taken to the streets to demand justice for the 26-year-old who was killed in her apartment in March.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When Ruth Bader Ginsburg graduated from law school, she received no job offers from New York law firms, despite being an outstanding student. She spent two years clerking for a federal district judge, who agreed to hire her only after persuasion, and was rejected for a role working with Justice Felix Frankfurter because she was a woman.
With her career apparently stuttering in the male-dominated legal world, she returned to Columbia University to work on a law project that required her to spend time in Sweden.</description>

The stakes are high: If President Trump is able to name another member of the Supreme Court, he would be the first president since Ronald Reagan to appoint three justices, tipping the institution in a much more conservative direction.</description>

The scale of the wildfires is dizzying — millions of acres have burned, 30 different blazes are raging and thousands of people have been displaced.
Dry conditions, exacerbated by climate change and combined with a windstorm, created the deadly tinderbox.
The disaster has proved a fertile ground for misinformation: Widely discredited rumors spread on social media claiming that antifa activists were setting fires and looting.</description>

The state’s current wildfires have seen two and a half million acres already burned.
Climate change has made conditions ripe for fires: Temperatures are higher and the landscape drier. But the destruction has also become more acute because of the number of homes that are built on the wildland-urban interface — where development meets wild vegetation.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At the beginning of 2020, Breonna Taylor posted on social media that it was going to be her year. She was planning a family with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker; she had a new job and a new car. She had also blocked Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug dealer with whom she had been romantically involved on and off since 2016, from her phone.
But forces were already in motion.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Three months into Broadway’s shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, Michael Paulson, a theater reporter for The New York Times, got a call from a theater in western Massachusetts — they planned to put on “Godspell,” a well-loved and much-performed musical from 1971, in the summer.
Today, we explore how, in the face of huge complications and potentially crushing risks, a regional production attempted to bring theater back to life.</description>

Jimmy Lai was born in mainland China but made his fortune in Hong Kong, starting as a sweatshop worker and becoming a clothing tycoon. After the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, he turned his attention to the media, launching publications critical of China’s Communist Party.
“I believe in the media,” he told Austin Ramzy, a Hong Kong reporter for The New York Times. “By delivering information, you’re actually delivering freedom.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Aleksandr Lukashenko came to office in Belarus in the 1990s on a nostalgic message, promising to undo moves toward a market economy and end the hardship the country had endured after gaining independence from the Soviet Union. As president, he acquired dictatorial powers, removing term limits, cracking down on opposition and stifling the press.
In recent years, however, economic stagnation has bred growing discontent. And when Mr. Lukashenko claimed an implausible landslide victory in a presidential election last month, he found himself facing mass protests that have only grown as he has attempted to crush them.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s plan for winning the presidential election relies on putting together African-American voters of all ages, including younger Black people who are less enthusiastic about him, and white moderates who find President Trump unacceptable.
At last week’s Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign appeared to be sowing discord within that coalition. By framing the response to unrest in cities as binary — you are either for violence or for the police — Republicans seemed to be daring Mr.</description>

As a police officer in his hometown of Flint, Mich., Scott Watson has worked to become a pillar of the community, believing his identity has placed him in a unique position to do his job. He has given out his cellphone number, driven students to prom and provided food and money to those who were hungry.
After watching the video of the killing of George Floyd, his identity as a Black police officer became a source of self-consciousness instead of pride.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Many American states use the labor of inmates to help fight its fires, but none so more than California. Using incarcerated firefighters saves the state’s taxpayers an estimated $100 million a year.
The women that choose to enter the firefighting camps are afforded better pay, by prison standards, and an improved quality of time served. However, the money they earn from putting their lives on the line is dwarfed by the salaries of the civilian firefighters they work alongside — one woman reports to earn $500 a year, compared with the $40,000 starting salary on the outside.</description>

He played only a bit part in the 2016 campaign and when the team departed for Washington, he was left to oversee a largely unimportant part of the Trump Organization. But after The New York Times revealed that he had played an integral role in organizing the Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians promising information on Hillary Clinton, the younger Mr.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Richard Nixon made an appeal to voters in the suburbs concerned about racial unrest across the United States after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. They helped deliver him the presidency that year, cementing suburbanites’ role as an integral voting bloc.
The 2020 election is also taking place against a backdrop of mass protests and unrest over racial justice. And speaker after speaker at the Republican National Convention has used the themes and language of 1968 to play on the perceived fears of suburban voters — cities on fire, the need to restore law and order.</description>

Meanwhile, America’s infection rate appears to be flattening out — but at tens of thousands of cases per day. This stands in stark contrast to China, where daily cases are under 40.</description>

Several theories have been advanced about why. Experts on crime say the coronavirus outbreak has deepened the endemic problems that often underlie gun violence, including poverty, unemployment, housing instability and hunger.</description>

It seemed impossible to impose social distancing in basketball, an indoor sport with players almost constantly jostling one another for more than two hours. However, there was a big financial incentive to keep games going: ending the 2019 season early would have cost the league an estimated $1 billion in television revenue.

        <description>Podcast Description Joseph R. Biden Jr. first ran for president in 1988, when his campaign was cut short after he made a series of blunders. After six terms in the Senate, he tried again in 2008 but failed to gain any traction in a contest won by Barack Obama. In the current political landscape, however, his focus on personal integrity and experience, which were also centerpieces of his previous campaigns, has proved much more compelling.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The installation of Louis DeJoy as postmaster general has caused alarm. Since taking up the role in June, he has enacted a number of cuts to the Postal Service: ending overtime for workers, limiting how many runs they can make in a day, reassigning more than 20 executives and, from the perspective of the unions, speeding up the removal of mail-sorting machines.
The actions of Mr. DeJoy, a Republican megadonor and Trump ally, have been interpreted by many Democrats as an attempt to sabotage the election in concert with President Trump, who has himself admitted to wanting to limit funding that could help mail-in voting.</description>

Things are going according to the most aggressive schedule.
However, accelerating the development process has increased the likelihood of cronyism and undue political influence.
Today, we ask whether the White House’s defiance of the timelines that have long governed the development of vaccines is working.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Note: This episode contains descriptions of sexual violence.
In the trial of Harvey Weinstein, six women have taken the stand, each making similar accusations of rape and sexual assault against the movie producer. Throughout their testimony, Weinstein’s defense lawyers have portrayed those encounters as consensual and suggested that in many cases it was the women who wanted something from Mr. Weinstein. His lawyers have seized on the fact that the two women whose accounts are at the center of the criminal charges in his New York trial agreed to have sex and friendly contact with Mr.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description The media’s coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign has come to be criticized for operating under three key assumptions: that Hillary Clinton was certain to be the Democratic nominee, that Donald Trump was unlikely to be the Republican nominee, and that once Clinton and Trump had become their party’s nominees, she would win.
With voting for 2020 set to begin in Iowa on Monday, “The Daily” sat down with Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, to discuss the lessons he — and the organization — learned from 2016.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description Three Rust Belt swing states are critical to winning the presidency this year — Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, there is one issue that could be decisive: fracking natural gas.
Opposition to fracking could be fatal for a candidate in the state, yet front-runners for the Democratic nomination have committed to banning fracking nationwide if elected. We went to western Pennsylvania, where fracking affects residents daily, to see whether electability in the state could really be reduced to this single issue.</description>

That year, 1999, was the last time the Senate considered whether a president had committed high crimes and misdemeanors. So what has changed since the Senate trial of President Bill Clinton, and why is this impeachment such a different story?</description>

This year, Senator Bernie Sanders is betting that he can win with the support of young voters and people of color — but without the moderates.
To do that, he’s counting on winning over and energizing the Latino vote. The ultimate test of whether he will be able to do that is in California, where Latinos are the single biggest nonwhite voting bloc.</description>

The tally foreshadowed the battle to come as Democrats take their case against the president fully into public view.</description>

        <description>Podcast Description When China first began experimenting with capitalism in the 1980s, the West was certain the experiment would fail. But two of its assumptions — that government controls stifle economic growth, and that the internet cannot be tamed — were quickly proven wrong.
Nearly 40 years later, China rivals the United States as a global superpower. Its continued success is challenging not just the West’s assumptions about China, but the West’s assumptions about itself.</description>
